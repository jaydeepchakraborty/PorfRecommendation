ABSTRACT

INTRODUCTION

WormBase (www.wormbase.org) is a central repository for research data on the biology, genetics and
genomics of Caenorhabditis elegans and other nematodes. The project has evolved from its original
remit to collect and integrate all data for a single
species, and now extends to numerous nematodes,
ranging from evolutionary comparators of C. elegans
to parasitic species that threaten plant, animal and
human health. Research activity using C. elegans
as a model system is as vibrant as ever, and we
have created new tools for community curation in response to the ever-increasing volume and complexity of data. To better allow users to navigate their
way through these data, we have made a number of
improvements to our main website, including new
tools for browsing genomic features and ontology
annotations. Finally, we have developed a new portal for parasitic worm genomes. WormBase ParaSite
(parasite.wormbase.org) contains all publicly available nematode and platyhelminth annotated genome
sequences, and is designed specifically to support
helminth genomic research.

Nematodes are the most abundant animals on the planet
(1), and over 25 000 species have been described (2), displaying a remarkable diversity in terms of size, form, lifestyle,
habitat and reproductive mode (3). Caenorhabditis elegans
is a free-living nematode that has been used for over 50
years as a model system in experimental biology (4). Its
transparency, reproductive mode, small size, rapid generation time, simple nervous system and invariant cell lineage
have made it ideally suited to the study of animal genetics
[(5); www.wormbook.org]. The mission of WormBase is to
facilitate and accelerate biological research using C. elegans
by making the collected outputs of the research community
accessible from a single resource, and to enable the transfer
of this wealth of knowledge to the study of other metazoa,
from nematodes to humans.
The specific aims of WormBase are to: (i) place nematode
data described in the research literature, deposited in the
archives, or directly submitted to us into context via a combination of detailed manual curation and semi-automatic
data integration; (ii) curate the reference genome sequence,
gene structures and other genomic features for a small set
of well-studied nematode species, thereby providing a high
quality foundation for downstream studies and (iii) develop
web displays and tools to allow users to easily visualize and
query these data.

CURATION STATUS
Genomes and annotations for core species

Enabling community curation of the research literature
Comprehensive extraction and standardization of data
from the C. elegans research literature remains one of the
primary goals of the project. We target over 20 specific data
types, and each presents its own challenge in terms of volume and ease of extraction. For some data types, such as
gene expression patterns, curation keeps pace with the literature. For others, such as the phenotypes of mutant alleles
and RNA-interference knockouts, the high volume of both
historical publications and more recent high-throughput
projects make the goal of keeping up-to-date unachievable
with the resources we have. Help from the community is vital to address this shortfall, and we have recently worked
on methods to allow researchers to contribute to curation
for a small number of specific data types with the biggest
backlog.
The three data-types that we have targeted are: (i) phenotypes of mutant alleles; (ii) molecular details for mutant
alleles and (iii) textual gene summaries. Custom web-forms
for each of these types have been designed to make the barrier to participation as low as possible (www.wormbase.org/
about/userguide/submit data). Authors of newly published
papers are invited to submit their data via the forms, and
researchers are also invited to review and update existing
annotations. Submissions received via this system are prioritised for curator review and inclusion in WormBase.
The gene summaries referred to above are short paragraphs that provide an overview of the gene and its function,
and include information about molecular identity, biological processes and pathways that the gene product partici-

WORMBASE PARASITE
Beyond C. elegans, the nematode species covered by WormBase fall into one of two categories: free-living relatives of C.
elegans; and plant and animal parasitic nematodes. For the
former, the research interest is mainly in the area of comparative genomics and evolution of the ‘reference’ nematode C. elegans. The latter, however, have biomedical and
agricultural importance and attract research interest in their
own right. The primary research goal of parasitologists is to
identify ways of controlling the parasite, and as such their
desired entry points and common use-cases for WormBase
are often distinct from those of scientists doing basic science
using C. elegans as a model. Furthermore, the community of
scientists working on parasitic worms (helminths) includes
those working on platyhelminths (flatworms), which have
historically been beyond the scope of WormBase. There
have been recent concerted efforts to sequence the genomes
of many helminths (e.g. the 50 Helminth Genomes initiative,
www.sanger.ac.uk/science/collaboration/50HGP). Most of
the genomes released so far are draft quality, and subject to
high update frequency.
In response to these challenges, we have embarked on
a systematic data integration effort for parasitic worms.
The results can be viewed in WormBase ParaSite (parasite.wormbase.org), a new sub-portal of WormBase aiming
to focus on the use-cases of scientists engaged in helminth
genomics.
Genomes and annotation
We have endeavoured to include all publicly available
helminth genomes in WormBase ParaSite. Where multiple
independent genome projects exists for the same species
(e.g. for Haemonchus contortus (7,8)), and Ascaris suum
(9,10)), we have included all. At time of writing we have
genomes from 63 nematode species (71 genomes) and 27

WormBase acts as the guardian of the reference genome
and annotation for C. elegans and a small number of additional ‘core’ species (www.wormbase.org/species/all), curating gene structures and other sequence features, assigning identifiers to primary annotation elements, and maintaining a complete historical record of all updates. In general, core status is reserved for species with a high-quality
(chromosome-level) reference genome and identifiable research community that have expressed a desire for continued improvement of the genome sequence and annotation.
We previously reported on the adoption of the filarial parasitic nematode Brugia malayi as a WormBase core
species, and described a concerted effort to annotate its
genome to high quality using a combination of modern
automated methods and manual curation (6). Since then,
we have added two key parasitic nematodes to the core
set: Onchocerca volvulus, a causative agent of onchocerciasis (river blindness), and Strongyloides ratti, the rat laboratory analogue of the causative agent of strongyloidiasis
(threadworm infection). Both genomes have undergone first
pass automatic gene structure annotation similar to that
performed for the B. malayi genome, and are currently undergoing targeted manual curation of gene structures. We
encourage users to report issues they find with the annotation of these genomes, and are committed to addressing
them as a priority.

pates in, temporal and spatial expression, and relationships
with other genes via interaction or homology. Although
WormBase users regard these summaries as highly valuable, the process of writing them is time-consuming. To address this, we have developed new software that automatically transforms structured data on gene function into natural language sentences, which are then collated to form a
summary description. For example, the description created
for the C. elegans gene tbc-8 (www.wormbase.org/species/
c elegans/gene/WBGene00008018) is:
‘tbc-8 is an ortholog of human SGSM2 (small G protein
signaling modulator 2) and SGSM1 (small G protein signaling modulator 1); tbc-8 is involved in dense core granule maturation; tbc-8 exhibits Rab GTPase binding activity
and is predicted to have GTPase activator activity, based on
protein domain information; tbc-8 is localized to the Golgi
trans cisterna, the early endosome, the Golgi medial cisterna and the cytosol.’
The software has allowed us to create several thousand
provisional gene summaries for C. elegans and other core
species. As well as being useful in their own right, they also
act as valuable and convenient starting points for manual
revision.

Nucleic Acids Research, 2015 3

Comparative genomics
We have used the Ensembl Compara system (17) to infer
evolutionary histories for all helminth genes, supplemented
by gene sets from 9 free-living species (including C. elegans)
and 12 comparator species (including human and other
model organisms). The result is the organisation of around
2.5 million genes into around 150 000 homology groups,
each with a protein multiple alignment which is used to infer orthologous and paralogous relationships between the
genes.
In addition to gene-based comparative analysis, we have
also a produced a whole-genome multiple alignment for a
subset of the collection, using Progressive Cactus (18,19).
This alignment is made available in the form of a Hierarchical Alignment (HAL) file (20), and included in the WormBase UCSC Assembly Hub (see below). More genomes will
be added to the alignment in the future.
Electronic annotation of gene function
The research literature for most of the species in WormBase
ParaSite is sparse, although we anticipate that the provision of the genomes will stimulate new research. In lieu of
annotations based on experimental evidence, we have used
established automated methods to predict the function of
as many gene products as possible. First, to predict protein domains, assign terms from the Gene Ontology (GO),
and classify the proteins into families, we have used InterProScan (21). Second, we have used the ortholog assignments from the Compara pipeline line to ‘project’ experimentally derived GO annotations and product names from
well-annotated species (for example C. elegans and other
model organisms).
Infrastructure and tools
The Ensembl infrastructure (22) is the basis for much of
the management, analysis and display of data in WormBase
ParaSite. This has allowed us to provide a number of tools
developed for the Ensembl project with little or no modification, for example the Variant Effect Predictor (23), and

REST application programming interface (24). Others we
have customised for use in WormBase ParaSite. For example, we have modified Ensembl code to provide a sequence
search service and BioMart data mining platform (25) that
allow the interrogation of all species, or large sub-groups
of species (e.g. all nematodes) at once in a single query (see
Figure 1).
All data for WormBase ParaSite can be downloaded from
our FTP site in a new folder (ftp://ftp.wormbase.org/pub/
wormbase/parasite) that uses identical structure and naming conventions to the main FTP site (which now restricts
to WormBase core species and genomic data sets from other
free-living nematode species).
WEBSITE AND TOOLS
The main website (www.wormbase.org) continues to focus
on the central mission of WormBase, which is to serve scientists using C. elegans as a model system. Since we launched
a new version of the site in 2012, we have continued refining
the organization and presentation of data with the aim of
making more information available at a single glance. Not
only does this minimize the amount of mouse clicking required to access common data, it can also provide new insights not possible when examining data on a piecemeal basis.
New genome browser
Browsing the genome is one of the most common tasks at
WormBase, facilitating exploration of the genetic and physical maps, reagents, gene structures, candidate genes for forward genetic screens, and targets for reverse genetics. More
recently, the genome browser has become the standard tool
for the exploration of large-scale, genome-wide studies of
gene expression and functional elements.
The current software driving the WormBase genome
browser, GBrowse (26), was originally developed for the
WormBase site and has now become a mainstay of many
model organism database projects (27–31). Designed before the advent of large-scale genomic datasets and the
types of queries users expect to levy against them, GBrowse
has reached end-of-life development status. After conducting a due-diligence survey of available replacements, we
have selected JBrowse (32) from the Generic Model Organism Database project (GMOD, www.gmod.org) to replace GBrowse in WormBase. JBrowse represents a significant advancement over GBrowse, being much faster when
browsing large regions, large datasets, or many tracks at
concurrently. It also shares many of the user interface elements with GBrowse, providing a shallow learning curve
for WormBase users.
JBrowse provides a number of features not present in
GBrowse. For example, it allows users to view their own
data in the browser without requiring the files to be uploaded to the server. Instead, the browser can be pointed
to local file or a URL specifying the location of a remote
file, and JBrowse will render the data by processing it locally. This is made possible due to the ‘in browser’ execution of JBrowse; all of the software to process the data and
display it is included in the JavaScript that is downloaded

platyhelminth species (28 genomes), and we maintain an
up-to-date list of all genomes available through the site
(parasite.wormbase.org/species.html).
These genome sequences have been collected from a variety of different sources, including the nucleotide archives,
project-specific FTP sites, and direct engagement with
genome project scientists. In all, 18 different groups were
responsible for generating the data. In about half of the
cases, we imported previously described or directly submitted gene structure annotations. For the remaining genomes,
we used MAKER2 (11) to generate high-quality annotations by integrating evidence from multiple sources: ab initio gene predictions from AUGUSTUS (12), GeneMarkES (13) and SNAP (14); projected annotations from C. elegans and the taxonomically nearest previously-annotated
helminth using GenBlastG (15) and RATT (16); and alignments of ESTs, mRNAs and proteins from related organisms.

when the user first accesses the tool. Another new feature
allows users to perform a degree of in-browser data analysis by combining data in tracks using arithmetic and set
operations, for example finding the union, intersection or
exclusive or (XOR) of two tracks. Combination tracks can
be used as input to other combination tracks, allowing users
to build up arbitrarily complex analysis tracks.
We have created JBrowse browsers for all core species
in WormBase, and these are currently available alongside
GBrowse (accessible from the Tools menu, and also as an
alternative view on the Location panel on each Gene page).
This allows users to migrate to the new tool at their own
pace.

AmiGO 2, which uses Apache Solr to store and index the
Gene Ontology and annotations made with it (36). We have
generalised the build procedure to allow the loading of
other ontologies and annotations, and created an index for
each ontology used by WormBase.
Building on these indexes, we have developed two interfaces for exploring ontology annotations: (i) a view for
each ontology term, which shows the relevant sub-graph of
related terms as an interactive tree and (ii) an interactive
browser, which allows root-to-leaf navigation of the complete directed acyclic graph for an ontology (see Figure 2).

Data mining platforms
New ontology browser
WormBase annotates genes with terms from established ontologies for anatomy (33) (for spatial expression), disease
(34) (for human disease relevance), life stage (for temporal expression) and phenotype (35) (for perturbation outcome), as well as gene function using the Gene Ontology
(36). We have added a graphical tool to make it easier for
users to navigate between related terms in these ontologies,
and to quickly retrieve genes annotated with specific terms.
The WormBase Ontology Browser (WOBr) is adapted from

The primary data mining platform in WormBase is WormMine, our custom deployment of the InterMine data warehousing software (37). We have recently migrated WormMine to the Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (AWS EC2),
facilitating more frequent updates and greater performance.
All WormBase core species are queryable in WormMine. In
forthcoming releases we are committed to deepening available data, first to RNA interference experiments and generic
access to genomic sequence, and later to all data classes
available through WormBase.

We also provide a separate data mining platform for the
WormBase ParaSite portal, using the BioMart technology
(38). Whereas WormMine aims to provide access to a rich
set of data for a small number of core species, ParaSite
BioMart aims to provide simple access to a small set of basic data types (e.g. sequence, orthologs, cross references) for
all nematode and platyhelminth genomes, and has been optimised to allow the querying of many species at once (Figure 1).

OUTREACH

INTEGRATION WITH OTHER RESOURCES
An important remit of WormBase is the dissemination of
project outputs beyond our own websites. We submit sequence annotations to the International Nucleotide Sequence Database Collaboration (INSDC) (39), and have
a formal partnership with the Ensembl (22) and Ensembl
Genomes (40) projects, working to ensure that up-to-date
data for nematode genomes is displayed in those resources.
To further increase the range of resources in which
WormBase data can be browsed, we have implemented
a WormBase Assembly Hub. Assembly Hubs (41) are an
emerging standard for the representation and remote hosting of data that can be displayed by genome browsers.
The WormBase Assembly Hub (www.wormbase.org/about/
userguide/wormbasehubs) is updated with every WormBase release, and allows, for the first time, current WormBase genomes and annotations to be viewed in the UCSC
genome browser (41).

As we reported previously (6), we are embarked on a major
re-design of the back-end infrastructure and curation tools
for WormBase. This is a long-term project, but we plan to
roll out elements of this in the coming year in a way that will
cause no disruption to users.
Increasing the utility of WormBase for biomedical research continues to be a priority for the project. We annotate C. elegans genes that have relevance to the study of
human disease (42), curating descriptions of the association and forming connections to terms from the Disease
Ontology (34) and to disease and gene records in the Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM) (43). We plan
to take this further by associating mutant alleles in C. elegans with orthologous genomic variants in human, using a
combination of programmatic data integration and manual
curation. We envision that this will be particularly useful
for the study of human variants of unknown significance.
On the specific issue of human disease caused by parasitic
worms, we plan to augment WormBase ParaSite with additional features for the identification of putative targets for
anti-helminthic drugs, for example by linking gene products
to the ChEMBL (44) database of medicinal chemistry.

After many years working closely with WormBase as the
guardian and authority for C. elegans genetic nomenclature,
Jonathan Hodgkin has now stepped down from this role. We
would like to thank him for his guidance and leadership.

WormBase fosters a close relationship with its primary
users, the C. elegans research community, collecting information on every active nematode laboratory and researcher,
and connecting data and research outputs to the scientists that reported them. We continue to implement modern and engaging ways to communicate with our users.
Our community forum (forums.wormbase.org) for discussion on general issues of nematode biology now has nearly
2000 members. We also continue to draw attention to interesting events and data sets in WormBase with our blog
(blog.wormbase.org) and Twitter feed (www.twitter.com/
wormbase).
To expand outreach efforts and engage more closely with
our users, we have recently added a new in-line real-time
chat feature to our website. Once initiated, users are connected directly with a WormBase staff member. Chat transcripts are automatically posted to our help desk issue
tracker to verify that questions and comments are addressed
satisfactorily. If a chat attempt is made whilst no operator is
online, questions are posted directly to our help desk queue
(as always, it is WormBase policy to acknowledge all queries
within a 24 h window). Whilst chatting, users can freely
navigate to other areas of the website, and even share their
screen with WormBase staff to discuss issues. This feature
provides us with a rapid way to address common questions
or concerns so that users can continue their research without waiting for a help desk response via email.
