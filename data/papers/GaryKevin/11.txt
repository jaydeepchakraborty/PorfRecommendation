This work explores the impact of teaching and learning if the rate of learner engagement outside the classroom is continuously measured and available to the instructor and students. We describe an ongoing implementation of a monitoring tool built within a software engineering continuous integration and testing (CI & Test) platform that integrates multiple streams of student activity and performance on yearlong junior software engineering projects. The CI & Test platform allows for continuous and instantaneous feedback, which we will use to inform student behavior change. In the work-in-progress we describe the technology, its impact on the teaching process for the instructor, and preliminary results observing impacts on student engagement behavior.
