n this paper we present a detailed analysis of the design and implementation of an educational game targeting young women entrepreneurs by a predominantly male team. During the process, we arrived at assumptions based on intrinsic and extrinsic influences that effected the design of the game. After creating a prototype, the game was provided to the target audience during a usability test. Our observations reveal that even after following a rigorous and agile development model that included stakeholders at several time frames, we were not successful in delivering the desired experience to our target audience. We conclude by presenting a strategy for changing the agile development model to be inclusive of the target audience.
