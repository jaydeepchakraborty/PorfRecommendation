The portfolio of capability of an entire defence force is a complex system of systems. Understanding and managing this portfolio has many challenges. This paper presents an account of the successful practical application of systems engineering tools and approaches to support portfolio level decision making. The concept of “Defence Capability Situation Awareness” is presented along with the prototype tool “Program Viewer” that demonstrates its utility. DODAF 2 and UPDM provide the standards underlying the modelling and management of data, which is stored in a systems engineering tool. The data to populate the model is collected from existing data sources from across the organisation, and this provides a critical mass of relevant and useful information. Custom fit-for-purpose visualisation and manipulation tools are provided to support understanding of the portfolio by decision-makers from many perspectives and present the consequences of proposed courses of action.
