ABSTRACT The Landsat Data Continuity Mission ('LDCM), a joint NASA and USGS mission, is scheduled for launch in December, 2012. The LRCM instrument payload will consist of the Operational Land Imager (OLI), provided by Ball Aerospace and Technology Corporation (BATC } under contract to NASA and the Thermal Infrared Sensor (TIRS), provided by NASA's Goddard Space Hight Center (GSFC). This paper outlines the design of the TIRS instrument and gives an example of its application to monitoring water consumption by measuring evapotranspiration.

land-use information, volcanic and lire-monitoring, data, and resource management guidance, a dual-band sensor at lower spatial resolution but with improved sensitivity would maintain continuity and provide valuable data for water resource management and agricultural studies. TIRE on LRCM is a 100 meter (I20 meter requirement) spatial resolution push-broorn imager whose two spectral channels, centered at near I0.8 and 12 microns. split the spectral range of the single TM and ETMt thermal band while still providing thermal band data continuity with previous Landsat missions. The push-broom implementation increases s y stem sensitivity by allowing longer integration times than whiskbroom sensors. The two channels allow the use of the split-window" technique to aid in atmospheric correction. The TIRS focal plane operates near 43 K and consists of three Quantum Well Infrared Photodetector (QWIP) arrays to span the 185 km swath width [5]. Infrared filters are used to define the spectral coverage of the two channels. The imaging telescope is a 4-element refractive leas system. A scene select mechanism (SSIvI ) rotates a scene mirror (SM) to change the field of regard from a nadir Earth view to either an on-board blackbody calibrator or a deep space view. The blackbod y is a full aperture calibrator whose temperature may be varied from 270 to 330 K. Figure I shows a model of the TIRS sensor unit with the major elements identified.

TIRS DESIGN OVERVIEW In a pushbroom instrument, an n row by m column 2..D image of a scene is built-up by concatenating; n successive single rove measurements each containin g m pixels. For TIRS on LDCNI, with its 185 knt swath wilh and 100 meter ground sample distance, a single row consists of 1850 pixels (m-1850). Because the orbital motion of the LDC1.1 spacecraft is about 7 kirtrsec it takes approximatel y 0.01 4 second to move the row by 100 meters, and 70 rows of 1850 pixels are read out every second hi both thermal channels_ The ft 1.64, 178 mm focal length TIRS optical system, consisting of a lens with three Ge elements and one 7nSe element, produces nearly diffraction-limited images at the focal plane. All but 2 of the surfaces are spherical, which simplifies fabrication. 'The optics are radiatively cooled to a nominal temperature of 185 K to reduce the contribution of
background thermal emission to the measurement noise.

producing an 1FOV of 142 lcradian. The arrays are bonded to a single silicon interface board that supplies the electrical connections between the detector arrays and two printed circuit "daughter boards". These latter are connected to the focal plane electronics (FPE) by two cables. The HE provides the clocks and biases to the arrays_ and converts the analog image data from the detectors to digital data which it sends to the main electronics box (NIEB). The MEB, in turn, sends the digital image data to the LRCM spacecraft for transmission to the grouted. The MEB also supplies power and commands to the TIRS instrument; collects and distributes housekeeping data, such a temperatures, voltages and currents; provides thermal control for the various stages of the instrument including the optics, the blackbody calibrator and the scene mirror; and controls the position of
the mirror as well as sending the position data to the

spacecraft for transmission to the ground. To meet the requirement that the position of a pixel on the ground must
be known to 18 meters (27 li.radian), the SSM encoder

position measurement is accurate to 10 tcradian_ The focal plane assembly (FPA) consists of an invar "spider" which is bonded to the silicon interface board containing the QWlPs and on which the "daughter beards" are mounted. The invar filter plate on which the spectral filters are bonded is also attached to the invar "spider". The FPA is connected to the cold-tip of a two stage cnocooler that cools the arrays to less than 43 K. The "warm" stage of
the cryocooler is used to cool a focal plane shield to about

Because of the fairly strong thermal dependence of the index
of refraction of Ge, the focus position of the lens is a

function of the optics temperature. This provides a method of adjusting focus so that, in the unlikely event that launch conditions or some other effect defocus the system, the temperature of the optics may be changed by ±-5 K to refocus. That is, thermal control of the lens provides a nonmechanieai focus mechanism. A +5 K change does not significantly degrade the noise: performance. The focal plane is made up of three 640 pixel x 512 pixel Qll°IP detector arrays. The QWlPs have 25µm pixels

85 K, further reducin g the background thermal noise. The cryocooler and its associated control electronics (CCE) are supplied by BATC. Figure 2 shows apicture of the FPA

QWIPs meet the operability requirements. The choice of rows can changed in flight, so that roves that contain a significant number of pixels whose performance degrades can be replaced. In operation, the SM is usually pointed in the nadir direction. It is rotated b y the SSti to view the blackbody calibrator and then deep space during calibration cycles. which occur about once every half orbit (-- 45 minutes). This allows for the correction of possible time variable offsets and trains. is order to meet the short term noise requirements of NEdT ; 0A K for a 300 K target, and the requirement that there be Tess than 0.7% drift between calibrations, the temperatures of the FPA, the optics and the SM are stabilized by active control systems. The FPA temperature is controlled by the CCE. The optics and SM temperatures are controlled by the NIIEB. The NIEB also actively controls the temperature of the blackbody calibrator to better than 0.1 K to meet the 2% absolute radiornetric accuracy requirement for scene temperatures between 260 and 330 K. Because of the relatively long time between calibrations, the inherent temporal stability of the QWIP response is also very valuable in maintaining the radiometric stability. In addition as risk mitigation, if. in 'flight, the thermal stability of the FPA degrades, the dark pixels may be used to correct for noise arising from dark current variations. 3.

Top) Picture of the FPA with the filters attached. dote that there are two filters over each array with a thin Mark strip between them. both with and without the spectral filters. As may be seen from this image the three QWIPs are in a staggered configuration. Each QW IP has two filters mounted within 300 Irm of it. These filters produce two areas of 30 rows each with a spectral response corresponding to the 10.8 and 12 um channels. There is an un-illuminated area of 20 rows between the two illuminated spectral areas, During data collection operations. two rows are read out from each of the three areas defined above for each array in each frame. That is, there are two rows of 103 8 pin data, two rows of 12 Elm data and two rows of dark data read from each array at the 70 Hz frame rate. These data are all transmitted to the ground where they are geo- rectified and combined to produce 1850 pixel wide swaths of image data for each channel. This process ensures that the requirement that there be at most one inoperable pixel per row is net, It also allows for some performance optimization in the choice of pixels. In practice, most of the pixels in a given row of the Consistent with previous Landsat missions, LDC%t 'FIRS will be fully calibrated prior to launch. Calibration measurements will be made at GSFC and will be done at the component, subsystem and instrument level. NIST-traceable instrument level calibration will be done using an inchamber calibration system. A description of the TIRS calibration process may be found in [8]. TINS algorithm development is being done in concert with the USGS and LRCM calibration validation and algorithm teams. The algorithms will be developed at GSFC, but the flight coding will be dog e by USGS'EROS. Since both 'TIRS and OU are pushhroom sensors there is significant commonality in their algorithm requirements and This commonality is taken being used to structures. In addition, Landsat maximize parallel development. heritage algorithms are used when possible. 4. DATA USE EXAMPLE TINS will be operated in concert with, but independent of, 01-1. Data from both instruments will be merged into a single data stream at the United States Geolo a ical Survey (I SGS);'Earth Resources Observation and Science (EROS) facility.
