Compressive Sensing Reconstruction of Correlated Images Using Joint Regularization
Kan Chang, Pak Lun Kevin Ding, and Baoxin Li, Senior Member, IEEE
Abstract--This letter proposes a novel compressive sensing reconstruction method for correlated images by using joint regularization, where a compensation-based adaptive total variation (CATV) regularization and a multi-image nonlocal low-rank (MNLR) regularization are included. In CATV, local weights are assigned to the residual values in the gradient domain so as to constrain the regularization strength at each pixel. In MNLR, the search of similar patches goes across different images so that both self-similarity and inter-image similarity are explored. Afterward, an efficient algorithm is proposed to solve the joint formulation, using a Split-Bregman-based technique. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated with experiments on both multiview images and video sequences. Index Terms--Compressive sensing, motion estimation/disparity estimation (ME/DE), nonlocal low-rank regularization (NLR), total variation.

HIS LETTER focuses on the compressive sensing (CS) reconstruction of a set of correlated images, each of which is independently acquired by the CS technique [1], [2]. The correlated images could be multiview images which represent a scene from different view points, or a series of video frames which are taken at different time points. More specifically, the CS measurement of the original ith image is acquired by y i = i u i (1)

where ui  RN stands for the original ith image, yi  RM is the measurement of the ith image, and i  RM ОN is the measurement matrix. Usually, M << N , and we call M/N the subrate of CS. To reconstruct the underlying images from such an underdetermined system, one common way is to employ image

where  is the regularization term denoting image prior. Different types of intra-image-based regularization have been investigated, including total variation (TV) minimization [3], nonlocal low-rank regularization (NLR) [4], nonlocal meansbased regularization [5], autoregressive model [6], dictionary learning-based sparse representation [7], etc. Besides intra-image prior information, inter-imagestructured sparsity also needs to be explored for correlated images. The most direct way to do this is to require a joint sparsity of the whole image set, such as [8]Г[11]. However, such methods are sensitive to motion or disparity. Improvement may be obtained by using the neighboring images to help reconstruct the current one, such as [12]Г[20]. In [21], correlation between a pair of images was directly estimated in the compressed domain so as to reduce the computational complexity. The main contributions of this letter are listed as follows. First, we propose a compensation-based adaptive TV regularization approach, where the reliability of each compensated pixel is considered. Second, we extend the existing NLR from single-image pattern to multiple-image pattern. Note that different from the similar model in [22], we additionally use optical flow (OF) fields to guide the central points of search windows. Finally, we jointly incorporate these two types of regularization into a minimization problem and design an optimization algorithm for CS reconstruction of correlated images. Experiments show that our proposed algorithm is capable of achieving significantly better reconstruction than several state-of-the-art methods. To facilitate evaluation and further exploration of the proposed algorithm, we will publish the source code on the third author's webpage.1 II. P ROPOSED J OINT R EGULARIZATION A. Compensation-Based Adaptive TV Regularization To explore inter-image correlation, we can utilize disparity estimation/disparity compensation (DE/DC) for multiview images or motion estimation/motion compensation (ME/MC) for video sequences. As have been proved in [17]Г[20], requiring small prediction error in the gradient domain is able to get satisfactory results. In [17], the compensation-based TV (CTV) regularization term was written as CTV (ui ) = D(ui - si )

with Fi-1 and Bi+1 standing for the forward and backward compensation operators by using the optical flow fields of the (i - 1)th and (i + 1)th images, respectively. We only used the closest images to build the compensated results because: 1) usually a further distance between two images leads to a less accurate compensated image and 2) the computational complexity of estimating the OF fields is high. Unfortunately, such an si is not always reliable on images with fine details, multiview images with large disparity, or video sequences with complex motion. Therefore, simply minimizing the regularization term (3) may sometimes deteriorate the quality of reconstructed images. Considering the reliability at each pixel in si , we propose to add local weights to the residual values in the gradient domain, leading to a compensation-based adaptive TV (CATV) regularization CATV (ui ) = Wi (D(ui - si ))

is the where Wi denotes the vector of local weights, and Hadamard product. If an unreliable predicted value occurs at a pixel position in si , a small weight should be assigned to it. To appropriately build Wi , a good spatial information indicator is needed. Here, the second derivative-based indicator called difference curvature [23] is utilized. It is a pixel-based indicator which can effectively discriminate edges from flat regions or noises. For the mth pixel, it is defined as Cm = ||e | - |e || e = e = e2 x exx + 2ex ey exy + 2 e2 x + ey e2 y eyy (6) (7) (8)

For correlated images, just exploring nonlocal low-rank property inside an image is not enough. Therefore, we propose to extend (10) to a new multi-image nonlocal low-rank (MNLR) regularization, which is written as

where ex and ey represent the first-order gradients of the pixel along x (horizontal) and y (vertical) directions, respectively; exx , eyy , and exy are the second-order gradients of the pixel. With Cm , the mth local weight in Wi is computed as wm = 1 1 + Cm (9)

where  is the contrast factor. It should be noted that our Wi is designed for residual in the gradient domain, which is different from other works such as [24] and [25] (i.e., Cm is computed on (ui - si ) instead of ui ). In practice, since the original images are not available, the previously reconstructed images are needed to calculate Wi . B. Multi-Image Nonlocal Low-Rank Regularization NLR [4] is an efficient tool for describing single image characteristics. To apply it, a target image is first divided into overlapped patches with size Sp О Sp . As a similarity metric, the l2 differences between the j th exemplar patch and the candidate patches within a search window are computed. After that, Np similar patches are found and grouped into a matrix

Different from R ~ i,j extracts its similar patches patch in the ith image, operator R from the (i - 1)th, ith, and (i + 1)th images. To find similar patches in three neighboring images, both intra-image and inter-image searches are needed. Fig. 1 illustrates how the search works. Recall that we have obtained OF fields when calculating si in (4). Thus, here they can be reused to guide the central points of search windows in the (i - 1)th and (i + 1)th images. More specifically, given a central point of a window in the ith image, we locate its motion/disparity vectors in the OF fields and use these vectors to find where this point is in the adjacent images. This procedure helps to find the most similar patches, especially in cases where large disparity or motion occurs among neighboring images. Note that higher quality of reconstruction can be achieved if the search goes across more images. However, doing so would cause heavier computational burden. Through experiments, we found that searching in three continuous images has achieved significant improvement over single-image NLR [4]. In addition, we only have the OF fields for each pair of adjacent images, which means the guidance for the central points of search windows is not available in further images.

E XPERIMENTAL R ESULTS This section evaluates the performance of JR-CSR. All experiments were performed in MATLAB 2013b on a Lenovo computer with Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-4790 processor, 8.00G memory. Structurally random matrices (SRM) [29] were used as i , and we had the measurement yi = i ui . To generate ~ 0 , TVAL3 [30] software2 was utilized for each image. To U construct C, OF implementation3 of [31] was used. In this OF implementation, successive over-relaxation (SOR) was applied to solve the linear system resulting from the energy functional of [32], where the assumptions of brightness constancy, gradient constancy, and piecewise smooth flow field were combined. T , K , and T0 were set to 15, 25, and 5, respectively.  in (9) was set to 0.8, patch size Sp О Sp for MNLR was 6 О 6, and the number of similar patches Np was 45. ,  , , and  were tuned according to each subrate. The test datasets included four multiview image sets [half size Monopoly (MP), Tsukuba (TK), Venus and Art] from

the middlebury multiview database4 and four video sequences [352 О 288 Foreman (FM), Football (FB), City, and Bus]. We tested the first five views of each multiview image set and the first 20 frames of each video sequence. Only grayscale images were considered. Four state-of-the-art algorithms were compared, including NLR-CS [4], JM-RCI [17], DC-JTV [20], and DC-TV [19]. For fair comparison, TVAL3 [30] was applied to obtain the initial results for all competing algorithms. The average peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) results of each multiview image set and each video sequence are given in Tables I and II, respectively. One can see that JR-CSR beats all the benchmark methods in all cases. For example, in Table I at a subrate of 0.10, JR-CSR gets 3.05 dB PSNR improvement over the second best method, i.e., NLR-CS. For visual quality comparison, please see Fig. 2. The average running times for reconstructing one frame in Foreman are listed in Table III. We can find that JR-CSR is the slowest algorithm. The main computational burdens are introduced by iteratively updating {Li,j }, U, and C. For each Li,j , 2 Np r), where r is the rank the complexity of thin SVD is O(Sp ~ of Ri,j U. To update U and C, CG and SOR are used to solve the related linear systems, respectively. Given a linear system Ax = z, assume that Nn is the number of nonzero entries in matrix A, and Nc is the condition number of A. To get the  vector x, the complexity of one iteration of CG is O(Nn Nc ), while O(Nn ) is required for one iteration of SOR. To speed up JR-CSR, parallelization techniques may be the best choice. Other solutions, such as updating C in JR-CSR only once, removing either CATV or MNLR from (12), etc., would lead to different levels of quality loss. V. C ONCLUSION In this letter, we proposed two types of regularization, including CATV and MNLR, for CS reconstruction of correlated image sets. After incorporating the two regularization terms into the minimization problem, we designed an optimization algorithm called JR-CSR. Through experiments, we found that JR-CSR is able to deliver the best performance among all the tested methods, which demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed joint regularization.
