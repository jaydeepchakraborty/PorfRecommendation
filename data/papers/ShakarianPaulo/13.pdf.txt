ABSTRACT
Each day, approximately 500 missing persons cases occur
that go unsolved/unresolved in the United States. The nonprofit organization known as the Find Me Group (FMG),
led by former law enforcement professionals, is dedicated to
solving or resolving these cases. This paper introduces the
Missing Person Intelligence Synthesis Toolkit (MIST) which
leverages a data-driven variant of geospatial abductive inference. This system takes search locations provided by a
group of experts and rank-orders them based on the probability assigned to areas based on the prior performance of
the experts taken as a group. We evaluate our approach
compared to the current practices employed by the Find Me
Group and found it significantly reduces the search area leading to a reduction of 31 square miles over 24 cases we
examined in our experiments. Currently, we are using MIST
to aid the Find Me Group in an active missing person case.

INTRODUCTION

Each day, approximately 500 missing persons cases occur
that go unsolved/unresolved in the United States. The nonprofit organization known as the Find Me Group (FMG),
led by former law enforcement professionals, is dedicated
to solving or resolving these cases. This non-profit operates with limited resources - so it must use its volunteer assets in a highly efficient manner. This paper introduces the
Missing Person Intelligence Synthesis Toolkit (MIST) which
leverages a data-driven variant of geospatial abductive inference [24]. This system takes search locations provided by
a group of experts and rank-orders them based on the probability assigned to areas based on the prior performance of

the experts taken as a group. We evaluate our approach
compared to the current practices employed by the FMG
and found it significantly reduces the search area. In 24
cases examined in our experiments (on real-world data provided by FMG), we found our approach to be able to reduce
total search area by a total of 31 square miles for standard
searches and by 19 square miles when dog team assets obtain
a detection. This reduction is significant for the following
reasons:
• Reduction in time to locate missing persons.
In cases where baseline provided 20 square miles or
more (the most difficult cases), we achieved reduction
in search area of 7 to 56 square miles. As 3-5 square
miles are searched on a typical day (terrain dependent), such a reduction can potentially increase the
chance of a missing person being found alive.
• Reduction in direct costs. During a search, FMG
spends approximately $2200 per day. In all tests, our
approach reduced the search area in the majority of
cases which can be interpreted as a reduction in direct
costs.
• Reduction in indirect costs. FMG relies extensively on volunteers to augment searches. During searches,
these individuals often lose earnings from their day job
or small business. As many volunteers also perform
consulting or other services to law enforcement, longer
searches lead to loss of revenue and opportunity. In
one case, a volunteer estimated a loss of $15K. Again,
our approach leads to a consistent reduction in search
area - hence reducing these indirect costs.
Specifically, we contribute an extension to geospatial abduction [24] that leverages historical data of individual experts. We also create new algorithms to learn parameters
of a geospatial abduction model from data based on integer
programming. We then evaluate these algorithms on realworld data provided by the FMG under a variety of different
settings. This approach learns pattern of each reporter independently and is able to overcome outliers if any. It also
does well on the limited data. This work has prepared us
in our ongoing deployment of the software. At the time of
this writing, we have provided results of MIST to support
an active case with FMG. Figure 1 shows an example output of MIST where it rank-orders search locations. FMG is
currently using this information to support their operations.
They found the result consistent with their experiences.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2,
we present the background of the missing person problem.
Next, we provide the technical preliminaries. We discuss
our data-driven extension in Section 4. In Section 5, we
detail our algorithmic approach. We introduce our dataset
and conduct data analysis in Section 6. Next, we discuss
the experimental results in Section 7. We review the related
work in Section 8. We conclude the paper presenting future
research directions.

BACKGROUND

Missing persons cases have been on the rise in the USA
for the past twenty years. Currently, approximately 4000
people go missing each and every day. Approximately 3500
of those cases are solved or resolved (i.e., cases solved by
only providing accurate information to the authorities and
without physical involvement), which leaves an astounding
number of victims that are never located. In the case of
missing adults 13 years of age and older, the police are not
required or obligated to conduct an investigation or search
unless there are extenuating circumstances such as suicide, a
potential for violence, medical reasons, etc. This leaves families and friends without professional assistance in locating
their loved ones. The Find Me Group (FMG) was founded
by retired U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) Special
Agent J.E. “Kelly” Snyder in 2002. The group consists of
current and retired law enforcement officers with a widerange of investigative expertise, including but not limited
to linguistics, handwriting analysis, body language, missing person/homicide experience and search-and-rescue field
management skills. The FMG has trained experts/sources
that provide detailed location information where missing individuals can be found. Many of these experts have the
ability to provide GPS coordinates to locate missing persons
with a varying levels of success. The FMG focus/goal is to
provide accurate location information in a timely manner
and minimize the potential of finding the victim deceased.
Thirty canine handlers certified in tracking, scent and cadaver complements the FMG and has led to many instances
where the person in questions was located.
Equally disturbing nationwide is the rise in human trafficking, which aligns within the missing person category.
This type of crime has long-term and devastating results.
The work of this paper is also the first step toward an allencompassing methodology of identifying locations of missing persons who were victims of human trafficking. Another

important related crime is homicide. Many missing persons
and human trafficking victims are found deceased due to this
crime. This work represents initial progress in aiding toward
crimes of this nature as well.
In this paper, we formulate the problem of “finding missing person” with respect to information provided by FMG’s
experts, formally as a variant of the geospatial abduction
problem (GAP) [22]. To account for the key nuances of
“finding missing person” problem though, we extended the
GAP framework to better suite this domain. In particular,
we extend the GAP formalism with a data driven model accounting for the previous performance of experts aiding in
the missing person cases. We list the unique characteristics
of our framework here. Later in the next section, we provide
our technical approach to each.
1. Explanation Size. One key difference “finding missing person” problem has from other GAP instances, is
that the explanation (the result of a GAP inference algorithm) only consists of a single related location (i.e.,
the location of the missing person) corresponding to
the phenomenon under study. This differs from returning a set of k locations in the previously-introduced
GAP formalisms. Consequently, here, an explanation
will consist of a single point, which in turn led us to
explore a non-deterministic version of the original explanation.
2. Distance Constraints. In the original GAP formalism, each observed geospatial phenomenon is related
to unobserved “partner” points through a distance constraint - (α,β) where α is the minimum distance between an observation and partner and β is the maximum distance. As described, this pair of constraints
was the same for all observations. However, in the
missing persons problem, each observation corresponds
to a different domain expert - and hence has a different (α,β) constraint pair. Further, we study how this
is best learned from data, as well as “soften” the constraint - assigning a probability of the partner point
being less than α, between distances α and β, and
greater than distance β from an observation.
3. Uncertainty. As we learn the (α,β) distance constraints for each observation and associate corresponding probabilities from historical data, it makes sense
that the inference step is treated probabilistically which differs from the original deterministic GAP framework. Further, this enables us to rank the potential
partner locations (again, as an explanation consists of
one point, ranking search locations is more useful in a
practical sense).
4. Independent Observations. In the original GAP
framework, independence amongst the observations was
not an assumption in the framework. However, FMG
compartmentalizes the information from their law enforcement experts from one another in a manner to
obtain independent reporting. Hence, we make this
assumption in this paper and it is supported by our
experimental results.
FMG currently uses a simple heuristic to rank-order potential search locations for a missing person (we describe this

later in Section 5). Once ranked, FMG leverages a variety of assets. Figure 2 depicts a recently searched area for
a case. It represents a screen shot of the tracks from the
GPS units that the dogs wear as well as the handheld units
that the searchers wear. This shows several dog tracks and
the human tracks. The green, dark blue, magenta represent
three dogs, the grey and red represent two human searchers.
The teal track is a trailing dog, ascertaining a direction of
travel. The straight lines tend to be humans and the rapidly
changing direction lines are dogs as they grid around the humans. Figure 3 shows real-world examples of how the FMG
practices in an undisclosed location.

in [23] and later extended in [24, 21, 20, 19]. More formally, each GAP consists of three major elements [22]: (1)
observations: a set of observations that explain the locations associated with the event under study (e.g., in this
application, the locations reported by the domain experts),
(2) distance constraints: a pair (α, β) ∈ R corresponding to
lower and upper bounds on the distances between observation and partner location and, (3) feasibility predicate: this
allows to specify whether an area on the map is a potential
location for a partner.
Next, we present the notations and definitions used throughout the paper, and review the geospatial abduction framework of [22]. In the next section, we describe specialized
extensions that were necessary to study our problem. First,
without loss of generality, we assume throughout the paper
that a map (resp. space) is represented by a discrete two
dimensional grid of size M × N , defined as follows:
Definition 3.1. (Space). Given natural numbers M ,
N , the space S is the set [1, . . . , M ] × [1, . . . , N ].

TECHNICAL PRELIMINARIES

In this section, we briefly explain geospatial abductive inference [24], and introduce our new (introduced in this paper) data-driven probabilistic extension. We show how this
extension was used to address the unique characteristics of
the missing person location problem.
In general, abduction or abductive inference [12] refers to
a type of logic or reasoning to derive plausible explanations
for a given set of facts [13]. Abduction has been extensively
studied in medicine [13, 14], fault diagnosis [3], belief revision [11], database updates [8, 4] and AI planning [5]. Two
major existing theories of abduction include logic-based abduction [6] and set-covering abduction [2]. Though none of
the above papers takes into account spatial inference, [25]
presents a logical formalism dealing with objects’ spatial occupancy, while [18] describes the construction of a qualitative spatial reasoning system based on sensor data from a
mobile robot.
Geospatial abduction problem (GAP) [22], on the other
hand, refers to the problem of identifying unobserved partner locations (i.e., the location of a missing person) that
best explain a set of observed phenomenon with known geographic locations. Geospatial abduction was first introduced

(a)

(b) Search team.

Associated with the space is a distance function d : S ×
S → R+ that satisfies the normal distance axioms: d(pi , pi ) =
0, d(pi , pj ) = d(pj , pi ), and d(pi , pj ) ≤ d(pi , pq ) + d(pq , pj ).
Note that we use o to represent the observer (source of information) and po to represent the location he/she reported
(which differs slightly from the original framework). From
these observations (reports), the corresponding unobserved
phenomenon is the actual location of the missing person.
In the original framework, the explanation consisted of geographic locations that were located at least distance α and
no more than distance β away from each observation. In
this work, we generalize this notion by providing α,β pair
for each observer - denoted αo ,βo .
Definition 3.2. (Feasibility Function). A feasibility
function feas is defined as feas : S → {True, False}.
A key use for the feasibility function here is for an initial
reduction of the search space by the FMG. This is due to the
fact that missing person reports often span a large area and
an initial reduction is necessary for practical reasons. An
obvious future direction would be to utilize a probabilistic
variant of the feasibility function - which would assign a prior
probability to a location for a missing person. However, in
this application, it is unclear where such a distribution would
come from. Further, as the search space is relatively large
when compared to FMG resources, the deterministic version
of this definition is more appropriate for operational reasons.
Due to resource constraints and the generally large areas
over which reports are spread, FMG typically only searches
areas for which there is a report. As we shall describe in
Section 5, they search a 1 × 1 mile square surrounding a
location reported by an observer. As such is the case, we
shall assume the following feasibility function throughout
this paper:
(
True
if p ∈ O
feas(p) =
(1)
False otherwise
Unless otherwise noted, we shall assume the above function is used for feasibility and hence the subset of the space
considered will be the points in O.
We now come to the important definition of an explanation. Intuitively, for a given set of points {p1 , . . . , p|O| }

reported by observers in O, an explanation is a set of points
E such that every point in this set is feasible and for every
observation, there is a point in E that is at least α units
away from the observation, but no more than β units from
the observation.
Definition 3.3. ((α,β) Explanation). Suppose O is
the set of observations, E is a finite set of points in S, and
0 ≤ α, β ≤ 1 are two real numbers. E is said to be an (α, β)
explanation of O iff:
• p ∈ E implies that feas(p) = True, i.e., all points in E
are feasible.
• (∀o ∈ O)(∃p ∈ E) α ≤ d(p, o) ≤ β, i.e., every observation is neither too close nor too far from some point
in E.
Thus, an (α,β) explanation is a set of points. Each point
must be feasible and every observation must have an analogous point in the explanation which is neither too close nor
too far.
Again, we note that here an explanation will consist of a
single point - the location of the missing person. Hence, this
deterministic definition of an explanation will not suffice as in practice there will often not exist an explanation for
a given problem instance. As such is the case, we extended
this framework using a data-driven approach.

4.

DATA-DRIVEN EXTENSIONS

In this section, we describe our data-driven probabilistic
extension to the original GAP formalism. The framework
extensions in this section were not previously introduced and
are new in this paper. In order to do so, we first introduce
some preliminary notation. For point p ∈ S, the random
variable Pp denotes that the missing person was found at
point p, so this is either true or false. We will use Pp as
shorthand for Pp = True. For observer o ∈ O the random
variable Oo can be assigned to one of the points in p. Based
on this notation, we define an explanation distribution.
Definition 4.1 (Explanation Distribution). Given
a set of observers O and a set of reported locations by each
observer p1 , . . . , po , . . . , p|O| , an explanation distribution
is a probability distribution over all points in S - directly addressing characteristic 3 of this application (see Section 2).
This distribution assigns the probability of a missing person
being located at each point conditioned on the observers reporting V
their respective locations. Formally, it is written as
P r(Pp | o∈O Oo = po ).
The key intuition is that if we are able to compute an explanation distribution, we can then rank-order points in the
space by probability - and hence conserve search resources.
Note that the explanation distribution is over all points implying that there is precisely one location. While generalizations that allow for more than one location are possible
in such a probabilistic framework, we keep the size at one
due to the first characteristic of our problem (as described
in Section 2).
In this paper, we make an assumption of distance primacy
meaning
the distance constraints (αo , βo ) relate the Pp with
V
o∈O Oo = po . Hence, we introduce another random vari0
o
able, Rβp,p
0 which is true if d(p, p ) ≤ βo and false otherwise.

Note that in the remainder of this section, we will use one
distance constraint (β) for sake of brevity - though this idea
can be extended for multiple distance constraints (as per
characteristic 2 from Section 2). In fact, we leverage multiple distance constraints in our optimization procedure for
parameter selection introduced later. Hence, by distance
primacy, we have the following relationships.
^
^ β
P r(Pp |
Oo = po ) = P r(Pp |
Rp,po )
(2)
o∈O

o∈O

By Bayes’ Theorem, this is equivalent to the following.
V
P r(Pp ) × P r( o∈O Rβp,po |Pp )
(3)
V
P r( o∈O Rβp,po )
However, by characteristic 4, we assume that the observers
report information independently, which gives us the following.
Q
P r(Pp ) × o∈O P r(Rβp,po |Pp )
(4)
V
P r( o∈O Rβp,po )
Due to our application, we will not consider the prior probability P r(Pp ) as each missing person case occurs in a different geographic location - and due to the wide range of
cases that span multiple countries, data supporting a realistic, informed prior is highly sparse. As such, we consider a
uninformed prior. Further, for notational simplicity, we shall
use the notation ρβo for the quantity P r(Rβp,po = True|Pp =
True). Therefore, we can rank points in the space based
on the explanation distribution by simply considering their
log-likelihood computed as follows:
X
X
log(ρβo ) +
log(1 − ρβo )
(5)
o∈O
d(p,po )≤β

o∈O
d(p,po )>β

Hence, the inference step for this problem is straightforward provided we know the values β and ρβo for each
observer o ∈ O (or similar parameters if considering more
than one distance constraint). If we know the value β we
can then compute ρβo based on a corpus of historical data
concerning the accuracy of reporter o. Given a corpus of
previous cases for the observer Co where the found location
was pc and the location reported by the observer was pco , we
can compute ρβo as follows:
ρβo =

|{c ∈ Co s.t. d(pc , pco ) ≤ β}|
|Co |

(6)

Hence, we also adjust ρβo to account for volume of the reporter’s history to provide the effect of regularization. Considering ηo as the portion of total number of cases in which
observer o has participated, to the total number of cases,
and  as a non-negative parameter, we define ρβ,
as follows:
o
ρβ,
= ρβo −  × (1 − ηo )
o

(7)

The situation is further complicated with multiple distance constraints. We propose an optimization approach to
this problem in the next section.

Existing Method

The FMG uses the following method to explore the missing person location. Given the reported locations provided
by different observers, FMG initially creates a search area
(grid) as follows. First, they draw building blocks (or boxes)
of size 1×1 mile centered at each reported location (note that
depending on the situation, these boxes may overlap). Then,
they search the entire grid in the following order. First, they
search the larger areas created of the overlapping boxes, and
if the missing person was not found, they explore the remaining boxes in the order of the observers’ history (how
well they did in the past). The whole process is repeated
by extending the size of boxes to 2×2 miles, if the missing
person was not located. Note that, we use the same grid in
our proposed methods.

5.2

Proposed Methods

As described, for simplicity, we first elaborate on the required steps to calculate the best βo for each observer. Then,
we extend the idea for multiple distance constraints. Let
[βo ] be the set of possible error radii. Note that for Co cases
where observer reported a location, there are at most |Co |
possible values for βo . Hence, our goal is to select as a set
of these distance constraints - one for each observer. We do
this through an integer program - where for each observer
o ∈ O and each associated distance constraint βo ∈ [βo ]
we have an indicator variable Xo,βo that is 1 if we use that
value and zero otherwise. We shall refer to this as the single
constraint integer program. Hence, we find an assignment of
values to these indicator variables in order to maximize the
following quantity:
XX X h
F1 =
δβ (pc , pco ) × log ρβo × Xo,β +

Therefore, the objective function we seek to optimize is
L1 = max(F1 − F2 )

(14)

Theorem 5.1. Number of variables in single-distance constraint integer program is O(avg(|Co |) · |O|).
We extend the previous formulation by allowing the objective function to find a pair of distance constraints for each
reporter. We have experimentally found diminishing returns
on performance (and in many cases increased complexity)
with more than two constraints. This will give us the double
distance constraint integer program as follows:

However, this equation will result in tendency toward selecting the largest distance constraints. This has the effect of not only maximizing the probability of the locations
where the missing person was found, but also can increase
the probability of other locations. Intuitively, we want to

Theorem 5.2. Number of variables in double distance constraint integer program is O(avg(|Co |)2 · |O|).
While we obtained a significant reduction in the area searched
by setting the cardinality constraint k = O, we found that
varying it would often lead to further improvement. We
gradually increased the number of observers from one to the
total number of observers and each time, we learned the
distance constraints for the last added observers. In this
method of optimization, we may choose a specific number
of points in each iteration. The number of points added
with each iteration can be determined based on available
resources.
We also defined two heuristic to discriminate points with
the same probability. In each iteration, we chose the point
with highest probability. If there were more than one point,

Table 1: Description of the dataset

we applied following heuristics: (1) we chose the points
which had most of the reported locations in its 1 × 1 mile.
(2) we chose the point which had the maximum summation
of the priors of the reporters in its 1 × 1 mile.
Algorithm 1 is a specific variant of restricted model. In
this algorithm, in each iteration one point (i.e., representative of a 1 × 1 mile) is selected. Though we note that this
can easily be adjusted in practice. If the area size we are
able to search is larger than number of observers, we sort
the representatives based on their probabilities. Then, we
apply two heuristics to rank them (similar to Lines 11-19 ).

Data Analysis

The dataset consists of cases distributed all over the world.
We split the U.S. based cases into 4 regions, west, midwest,
northeast and south, according to the United States Census
Bureau. We further grouped together all cities outside the
U.S. into one single category, namely, international. The
distribution of cases across different regions is demonstrated
in Figure 4. Though we did not explicitly show in the figure,
the west is dominated by Arizona and California, due to the
large focus of FMG on these two states.
There are several known reasons of disappearance associated with the cases in our dataset including, accidental,

MISSING PERSON DATASET

Our dataset includes cases (i.e., missing persons), found
status (alive/deceased), found location (latitude and longitude), age and reason for disappearance as well as the potential locations (latitude and longitude) associated with the
reporters/experts. The description of this dataset is summarized in Table 1. Note that in some cases, we are aware of
reports, but do not have the found location (pco ). In this
work, we only have 29 cases with the known found locations
used for the experiments. However, for the data analysis,
the entire dataset is applied.

For the rest of our data analysis, we need to introduce
some preliminary notation. We use the random variable gA
to denote if the missing person is found alive or not, so it is
either true or false. We shall use P r(gA = True|o stated Alive)
to denote the confidence of the observer o in reporting Alive.
This confidence value shows the portion of the cases for
which o has reported the missing person is Alive and he/she
was found Alive, to the total number of cases for which o has
reported Alive. Likewise, we compute the confidence of o in
reporting Deceased. The distribution of the reporters with
respect to their confidence values is demonstrated in Figure 7. According to the figure, most reporters’ confidence
values belong to the ranges of [0.3,0.4) for alive and [0.8,0.9)
for deceased statuses.
We also define the ratio rA as follows:
rA =

P r(gA = True|observer o stated Alive)
P r(gA = True)

(17)

This ratio demonstrates how much the observer o outperformed the prior probability P r(gA = True) on Alive. Similarly, we use rD for Deceased cases. The distributions of the
reporters with respect to rA and rD are shown in Figure 8.
We note that as most are found dead, it is harder for the

EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS

This section reports on the experiments conducted to validate our approach. We note that the individual cases themselves are not related - hence we are justified in using leaveone-out cross validation in our experiments. Specifically, for
each case in the experiments, we learn a different model
using all of the other cases. We first compare the methods for restricted (without dog) and unrestricted (with dog)
searches and then discuss the sensitivity of the parameter.

7.1

Area Reduction

In this section, we examine how our approach can be used
to reduce the area searched by the Find Me Group over the
baseline. Figure 9 shows the reduction of area based on our
approach (double distance constraint integer program with
Algorithm 1 and  = 0.1) when compared to the baseline.
We examine this with grid squares of 1×1 miles and 2×2
miles. In the 19 cases where the missing person was located,
our approach achieved area reduction in 11 cases - reducing
the search area by an average by 3 square miles. In the 2
cases where our method caused the search area to increase,
the increase was only 1 square mile in each case. This contrasts with the cases where the area was reduced - reducing
the search area by up to 9 square miles. For the 11 cases
where reduction was experienced, the average reduction was
1.63 miles (t(19) = 1.25, p <0.11).
We also examined cases where the size of the grid squares
was 2×2 miles. In the 19 cases, the area reduction achieved
by our method was in 14 cases, and by an average by 8.5
square miles. Further, in the 6 cases, our method caused
an increase in the search area, however, the increase was 3
square miles on average. Further, for the cases that baseline needs to search areas larger than 20 square miles, our
approach reduced the area from 7 to 56. Our method outperformed the baseline in area reduction with an average of
4.21 mile square (t(20) = 1.19, p <0.13).

7.2

Consideration of Dog Team Detections

The experiments of the previous section illustrated how
our approach could reduce the search area over the baseline
for standard grid settings. However, in the events that a dog

team detects evidence of the missing person, it may lead to a
continued search outside of the assigned grid square. These
searches can lead to FMG personnel examining up to a mile
outside a designated location. In this section, we consider a
grid square settings in the last section, but also allow for an
additional mile outside the square to mimic the effect of the
dog search team following such a lead. Figure 10 demonstrates the reduction of area based on our approach (double
distance constraint integer program with Algorithm 1 and
 = 0.1) when compared to the baseline. We investigate the
area reduction with grid squares of 1×1 miles and 2×2 miles.
According to Figure 10a, in the 22 cases where the missing
person was located, our approach achieved area reduction in
12 cases - reducing the search area by 2 square miles on average. In the 2 cases where our method caused the search area
to increase, the increase was only 3 square miles on average.
This contrasts with the cases where the area was reduced
- reducing the search area by up to 9 square miles. Our
method outperformed the baseline in area reduction with
an average of 0.86 mile square (t(22) = 0.8, p <0.22).
We examined cases where the size of the grid squares was
2×2 miles. In the 24 cases, the area reduction achieved by
our method was in 21 cases, and on average by 8.85 square
miles. In the 3 cases where our method caused the search
area to increase, the increase was 4.3 square miles on aver-

age. This contrasts with the cases with the reduced search
area by up to 56 square miles. Our method outperformed
the baseline in area reduction with an average of 7.2 mile
square (t(24) = 1.95, p <0.05).

7.3

Parameter Sensitivity

We compare different values of  in both double distance
constraint integer programs (iterative search resource allocation and non-iterative program). The impact of changing
the parameter  is shown in Figure 11. To do so, we plot the
fraction of area searched by our method over the baseline,
against the , for both sizes of 1 × 1 and 2 × 2. We note that
while the extreme values of  (i.e. 0.0 and 0.5) negatively
effected the performance of both approaches, we achieved
relatively stable results for intermediate values - noting that
the best performance was to set  equal to 0.1 - which we
used in the experiments.
We also studied the performance of our optimization approach without algorithm 1 (i.e. prioritize locations by equation 5 after selecting the values for βo through optimization
of 19 with regards to Lines 9-11). The results are depicted
in Figure 12. The behavior of the algorithm for different
settings of  were similar to that found with Algorithm 1,
the reduction in search area was generally less - and in some

RELATED WORK

Recently, there has been some work [19, 20, 21, 23, 9] dealing with geospatial abductive inference introduced in [24].
In [19] for example, authors studied the case of geospatial
abduction where there is an explicit adversary who is interested in ensuring that the agent does not detect the partner
locations in an attempt to simulating the real-world scenario of insurgents who conduct IED (improvised explosive
device) attacks. Another work [20], has adopted geospatial
abduction to develop a software tool which applies geospatial
abduction to the environment of Afghanistan, to look for insurgent high-value targets, supporting insurgent operations.
The work of [21] introduced a variant of the GAPs called
region-based GAPs (RGAPs) which deals with the multiple
possible definitions of the subregions of the map. Finally,
spatial cultural abductive reasoning engine which solves spatial abductive problems was developed in [23]. Aside from
introducing GAP, the work of [24] demonstrated the accuracy of proposed framework on real-world dataset of insurgent IED attacks against US forces in Iraq. Further, the
work of [9], proposed a technique to reduce the computational cost of point-based GAPs. They presented an exact
algorithm for the natural optimization problem of pointbased GAPs. Geospatial abduction problems are related
to facility location [26] and sensor placement problems [10]
in that they identify a set of geo-locations to optimize a

cost or reward function. However, there are key differences
amongst these various frameworks that arise from the difference between explanation and optimization. See [22] for
further discussion on this topic.
Similarly, [1] presents a specific aspect of the well-known
qualification problem, namely spatial qualitative reasoning
approach, which aims at investigating the possibility of an
agent being present at a specific location at a certain time
to carry out an action or participate in an event, given
its known antecedents. This work is different from both
above papers and our study, as it takes on purely logical approach to formalizing spatial qualifications, while our work
and other aforementioned studies use geometric and probabilistic techniques. Further, the framework of this paper is
tailored specifically for the missing person problem.
Looking beyond geospatial abduction, recent research has
demonstrated that GPS (positional) data could be used to
learn rich models of human activity [16, 15, 17, 7]. For example, [16, 15, 17], modeled the human interactions and intentions in a fully relational multi-agent setting. They used
raw GPS data from a real-world game of capture the flag and
Markov logic- a statistical-relational language. Whereas [7]
developed a model to simulate the behaviors associated with
insurgent attacks, and their relationship with geographic locations and temporal windows.
At first glance, one may think our work is similar to [10],
in that they identify a set of geo-locations to optimize a

cost or reward function. However, as described, there are
key differences amongst these various frameworks that arise
from the difference between explanation and optimization.

CONCLUSION

In this paper, we have introduced the Missing Person Intelligence Synthesis Toolkit (MIST) which leverages a datadriven variant of geospatial abductive inference. MIST can
rank-order the set of search locations provided by a group
of experts. The experimental results showed that our approach is able to reduce the total search area by a total of 31
square miles for standard searched and by 19 square miles
when dog team assets obtain a detection. This reduction
will make FMG locating missing persons faster while saving in direct and indirect cost. At the time of this writing,
we have initiated support to FMG with MIST for an active
case. FMG will use MIST’s ranking of search locations for
this ongoing operation.
Our future plans include utilizing a probabilistic variant
of the feasibility function, applying other features such as
missing person’s region, age, gender to the model and extending our toolkit to be able to solve other problems such
as human trafficking.
