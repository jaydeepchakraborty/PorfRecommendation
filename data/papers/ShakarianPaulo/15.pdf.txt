Abstract—Human trafficking is among the most challenging
law enforcement problems which demands persistent fight against
from all over the globe. In this study, we leverage readily
available data from the website “Backpage”– used for classified
advertisement– to discern potential patterns of human trafficking
activities which manifest online and identify most likely trafficking related advertisements. Due to the lack of ground truth,
we rely on two human analysts –one human trafficking victim
survivor and one from law enforcement, for hand-labeling the
small portion of the crawled data. We then present a semisupervised learning approach that is trained on the available
labeled and unlabeled data and evaluated on unseen data with
further verification of experts.

I. I NTRODUCTION
Human trafficking has received increased national and societal concern over the past decade [1]. According to the
United Nation [2], human trafficking is defined as the modern
slavery or the trade of humans mostly for the purpose of
sexual exploiting and forced labor, via different improper ways
including force, fraud and deception. Human trafficking is
among the challenging problems facing the law enforcement–
it is difficult to identify victims and counter traffickers.
Before the advent of the Internet, pimps were under the risks
of being arrested by law enforcement, while advertising their
victims on the streets [3]. However, the move to the Internet,
has made it easier and less dangerous for both sex buyers and
sellers, especially for the pimps [4] as they no longer needed
to advertise on the streets. There are now plethora of websites
that host and provide sexual services, under categories of
escort, adult entertainment, massage services, etc., which help
pimps, traffickers and sex buyers (a.k.a. “johns”), maintain
their anonymity. Though some services such as Craiglist’s
adult section and myredbook.com were shut down recently,
still there are many websites such as Backpage.com that
provide such services and many new are frequently created.
Traffickers even use dating and social networking websites,
including Twitter, Facebook, Instagram and Tinder to reach
out to the johns and their other followers. Although Internet
has presented new trafficking related challenges for law enforcement, it has also provided readily and publicly available
rich source of information which could be gleaned from online
sex advertisements for fighting this crime [5].

Although, the Internet is being used for many other activities
including attracting the victims, communicating with costumers and rating the escort services, here we only focus on the
online advertisements. In this study, we use data crawled from
the adult entertainment section of the website Backpage.com
and propose a non-parametric learning approach to identify the
most likely human trafficking related online advertisements out
of the escort advertisements. To the best of our knowledge,
this is the first study that employs both data mining and
semi-supervised machine learning techniques to identify the
potential human trafficking related advertisements given only
a small portion of labeled data. We thus make the following
contributions.
1) We collected real posts from the U.S. cities represented
on Backpage.com. The data was then preprocessed and
cleaned.
2) Based on the literature, we created different groups
of features that capture the characteristics of potential
human trafficking activities. The less likely human trafficking related posts were then filtered out using these
features.
3) Due to the lack of ground truth, we relied on human
analysts for hand-labeling small portion of the filtered
data.
4) We trained a semi-supervised learner on labeled and
unlabeled data and sent back the identified highly human trafficking related advertisements to the experts for
further verification. We then validated our approach on
unseen data with further verification of experts.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section II,
we briefly provide the background of the problem of human
trafficking. Next, we review the prior studies on human trafficking in Section III. Then in Section IV, we explain our data
preparation and feature extraction scheme. Our unsupervised
filtering and expert assisted labeling are explained in Sections
V and VI, respectively. We detail our non-parametric learning
approach in Sections VII. We conclude the paper by providing
future research directions in Section VIII.
II. BACKGROUND
The United States’ Trafficking Victim Protection Act of
2000 (TVPA 2000) [6], was the first U.S. legislation passed

against human trafficking. According to TVPA 2000, sex
trafficking is a severe form of trafficking, where force, fraud
or corecion are primary ways of inducing commercial sex
act. Human Trafficking is a crime against humanity and is
one of the most atrocious crimes of global magnitude. It is
a $150 billion industry of exploitation of children and young
adults, utilizing humans for forced labor and sex trafficking
worldwide. No country is immune and the problem is rapidly
growing with little to no law enforcement addressing the issue
and approximately 161 countries affected. Human trafficking
is considered to be a form of modern day slavery. Humans
are controlled, exploited, abused, forced into prostitution and
labor of servitude in some form and all under the threat of
punishment if they do not perform their required duties.
The Find Me Group (FMG) was founded by retired DEA
Special Agent Jerry “Kelly” Snyder in 2002 primarily to
locate missing persons. The natural evolution of the group
in locating missing persons was to allocate resources for
locating victims in human trafficking, as well as identifying
the persons responsible and reporting these organizations to
law enforcement. The FMG consists of current and retired
law enforcement agents and officers with a wide-range of
investigative expertise, including but not limited to linguistics,
handwriting analysis, body language, missing persons and
homicide. The search and rescue component of the FMG is
also comprised of current and retired law enforcement officers
and agents with 28 years of field management skills in locating
missing persons. The FMG has an additional advantage by
using trained experts/sources that provide detailed location
information of human trafficking victims.
The ultimate goal of the current project is to identify
missing persons which are connected to human trafficking
organizations. This can be done by identifying their locations,
utilizing logistical methodology with an additional focus on
their financial status and reporting assets to worldwide law
enforcement.
III. R ELATED W ORK
Recently, several studies have examined the role of the Internet and related technology in facilitating human trafficking[7],
[8], [9]. For example, the work of [7] studied how closely sex
trafficking is intertwined with new technologies. According
to [8], “The sexual exploitation of women and children is
a global human rights crisis that is being escalated by the
use of new technologies”. Researchers have studied the relationship between new technologies and human trafficking and
advantages of the Internet for sex traffickers. For instance,
according to [9], findings from a group of experts from the
Council of Europe demonstrate that the Internet and sex
industry are closely interlinked and the volume and content
of the material on the Internet promoting human trafficking
are unprecedented.
One of the earliest works which leveraged data mining
techniques for online human trafficking was [9], where the
authors conducted an analysis of data on the adult section
of the website Backpage.com. Their findings confirmed that

the female escort post frequency would increase in Dallas,
Texas, leading up to Super Bowl 2011 event. In a similar
attempt, other studies [10], [11] have investigated the impact
of large public events such as Super Bowl on sex trafficking
by exploring advertisement volume, trends and movement of
advertisements along with the scope and volume of demand
associated with such events. The work of [10], for instance,
concludes that in large events like Super Bowl which attract
significant amount of concentration of people in a relatively
short period of time and in a confined urban area, could be
a desirable location for sex traffickers to bring their victims
for commercial sexual exploitation. Similarly, the data-driven
approach of [11] shows that in some but not all events, one
can see a correlation between the occurrence of the event and
statistically significant evidence of an influx of sex trafficking
activity. Also, certain studies [12] have tried to build large
distributed systems to store and process the available online
human trafficking data in order to perform entity resolution
and create ontological relations between the entities.
Beyond these works, the work of [13], studied the problem
of isolating sources of human trafficking from online advertisements with a pairwise entity resolution approach. Specifically,
they trained a classifier to predict if two ads are from the
same source, using phone numbers as a strong feature. Then,
this classifier was used to perform entity resolution using a
heuristically learned value for the score of classifier. Another
work of [5] used Backpage.com data and extracted most likely
human trafficking spatio-temporal patterns with the help of law
enforcement. Note that unlike our method, this work did not
employ any machine learning methodologies for automatically
identifying the human trafficking related advertisements. The
work of [14] also used machine learning techniques by training
a supervised learning classifier on labeled data (based on the
phone numbers of known traffickers) provided by a victim
advocacy group, for the ad-classification problem. We note that
while phone numbers can provide very precise set of positive
labeled data, there are clearly many posts with previously
unseen phone numbers. In contrast, we do not solely rely on
the phone numbers for labeling the data. Instead, our experts
analyze the whole post’s content to identify whether it is
human trafficking related or not. Indeed, we first filter out
the most likely advertisements using several feature groups
and pass a small sample to the experts for hand-labeling.
Then, we train semi-supervised learner on both labeled and
unlabeled data which in turn let us evaluate our approach on
the new coming (unseen) data as well. We note that our semisupervised approach can also be used as a complementary
method to procedures such as those described in [14] as we can
significantly expand the training set for use with supervised
learning.
IV. DATA C OLLECTION E FFORT
We collected about 20K publicly available listings from
the U.S. posted on Backpage.com in March, 2016. Each post
includes a title, description, time stamp, the poster’s age,
poster’s ID, location, image, video and sometimes audio. The

description usually lists the attributes of the individual(s) and
contact phone numbers. In this work we only focus on the
textual component of the data. This free-text data required
significant cleaning due to a variety of issues common to
textual analytics (i.e. misspellings, format of phone numbers,
etc.). We also acknowledge that the information in data could
be intentionally inaccurate, such as the poster’s name, age and
even physical appearance (i.e. bra cup size, weight). Figure 1
shows an actual post from Backpage.com. To illustrate the
geographic diversity of the listings, we also plot the phone
distribution with respect to the different states in Figure 2.
Note that for brevity, we only show those with a frequency
greater than 5.

for multiple escorts with the first individual coming from Asia
and very young. In the followings, we discuss such common
properties of human trafficking related advertisements, in more
details.
Inspired from literature, we define and extract 6 groups of
features from advertisements, shown in Table I, which could
be amongst the strong indicators of the human trafficking. In
what follows, we briefly describe each group of features used
in our work. Each feature listed is treated as a binary variable.
1) Advertisement Language Pattern: The first group consists of different language related features. For the first and
second features, we identify posts which has third person
language (more likely to be written by someone other than the
escort) and posts which contain first person plural pronouns
such as ‘we’ and ‘our’ (more likely to be an organization) [5].

Next, we explain the most important characteristics of
potential human trafficking advertisements captured by our
feature groups.
A. Feature Engineering
Though many advertisements on Backpage.com are posted
by posters selling their own services without coercion and
intervention of traffickers, some do exhibit many common
trafficking triggers. For example, in contrast to the previous advertisements, Figure 3 shows an advertisement that could be an
evidence of human trafficking. This advertisement has several
potential properties of human trafficking including advertising

To ensure their anonymity, traffickers would deploy techniques to generate diverse information and hence make their
posts look more complicated. They usually do this to avoid being identified by either human analyst or automated programs.
Thus, to obtain the third feature, we take an approach from
complexity theory, namely Kolmogorov complexity which is
defined as the length of the shortest program to reproduce the
advertisement content on a universal machine such as Turing
Machine [15]. We approximate the Kolmogorov complexity of
an advertisement’s content, by simply computing the Entropy
of the content [15] as follows. Let X denote the content and
xi be a given word in the content. We use the following

equation [21] to calculate the Entropy of the content.
H(X) = −

evidence of human trafficking– this is described in the next
section.
(1)

i=1

We expect higher values of the Entropy correspond to
human trafficking. Finally, we discretize the result by using
the threshold of 4 which was found empirically in our experiments.
Next, we use word-level n-grams to find the common
language patterns of the advertisements, as the character-level
n-grams have already shown to be useful in detecting
unwanted content for Spam detection [16]. We set n = 4
and compute the normalized n-grams (using TF-IDF) of the
advertisement’s content and use threshold of 0.5 to binarize
their values. This gives us 6 more features to include into
our feature set. Overall, we have 9 features related to the
language of the advertisement.
2) Words and Phrases of Interest: Despite the fact that
advertisements on Backpage.com do not directly mention
sex with children, costumers who prefer children, know to
look for words and phrases such as “sweet, candy, fresh,
new in town, new to the game” [17], [18], [19]. We thus
investigate within the posts to see if they contain such words as
they could be highly related with human trafficking in general.

V. U NSUPERVISED F ILTERING
Having detailed our feature set, we now construct feature
vectors for each instance by creating a vector of 15 binary
features that correspond to the important characteristics of
human trafficking related posts.
We obtain 999 instances from our dataset by filtering out
samples that do not posses any of the binary features. We
will refer to this as our filtered dataset. In Figure 4, we
visualize 500 of the 999 samples and an additional 500
samples outside of the filtered dataset (i.e., from the remainder
of the samples) we studied in a 2-D projection (using the tSNE transformation [22]). We clustered the visualized samples
into 2 clusters (using K-means) and found the clusters to be
purely either inside or outside of the sampled data (100% of
samples in cluster 1 were from the identified listings and 100%
of samples in cluster 2 were from outside this group).
Fig. 4. Two clusters of a portion of the filtered data set combined with
random samples from the remainder of the samples, in the trasformed feature
space.

3) Countries of Interest: We identify if the individual
being escorted is coming from other countries such as those
in Southeast Asia (especially from China, Vietnam, Korea
and Thailand, as we observed in our data) [1].
4) Multiple Victims Advertised: Some advertisements
advertise for multiple women at the same time. We consider
the presence of more than one girl as a potential evidence of
organized human trafficking [5].
5) Victim Weight: We take into account weight of the
individual being escorted as a feature (if it is available).
This information is particularly useful assuming that for
the most part, lower body weights (under 110 lbs) correlate
with smaller and underage girls [6], [20] and thereby human
trafficking.
6) Reference to Website or Spa Massage Therapy: The
presence of a link in the advertisement, either referencing
to an outside website (especially infamous ones) or spa
massage therapy, could be an indicator of more elaborate
organization [5]. In case of spa therapy, we observed many
advertisements interrelated with advertising for young Asian
girls and their erotic massage abilities. Therefore, the last
group has two binary features for the presence of both website
and spa.
In order to extract these features, we first clean the original
data and conduct preprocessing. Then we draw 999 instances
out of our dataset for further analysis, as they might be

We then create a second feature space that is used through
the remainder of the paper. Using Latent Drichlet Allocation
(LDA) [23] topic modeling from Python package gensim [24],
we identify 25 most representative topics out of the filtered
dataset. This allows us to uncover the hidden thematic structure in the data. Further, we rely on the document-topic
distribution given by the LDA (here each document is seen as
a mixture of topics) to distinguish the normal advertisements
(outliers) from highly human trafficking related ones. More
specifically, we treat each listing in the filtered data as a vector
of 25 probabilistic values provided by LDA’s document-topic
distribution– this feature space is used in the next step.
Moreover, since we lack ground truth for our data, we rely
on human analysts (experts) for labeling the listings as either
human trafficking or not. In the next section, we select a
smaller yet finer grain subset of this data to be sent to the
experts. This alleviates the burden of the tedious work of handlabeling.

VALIDATED RESULTS ON UNLABELED DATA FOR BOTH KERNELS .

VI. E XPERT A SSISTED L ABELING
We first obtain a sample of 150 listings from the filtered
dataset. This set of listings was labeled by two human experts:
a previous human trafficking victim and a law enforcement
officer who specialized in this type of crime. From this subset,
a law enforcement professional and human trafficking victim
identified 38 and 139 instances (respectively) to be human
trafficking related instances. Among them, there were 31
records for which both experts agreed were highly related to
human trafficking. Thus, we now have 31 confirmed positive
samples, but still have large amounts of unlabeled examples
(849 instances) in our dataset. We summarize the data statistics
in Table II. Any sample for which at least one expert labeled
as negative, we treated as a negative sample.

In the next section, we explain how we deploy a nonparametric learning approach to identify the labels of the rest
of the data to be sent for further expert verification.
VII. N ON -PARAMETRIC L EARNING
We use the Python package scikit-learn [25] for training
semi-supervised learner on the filtered dataset. There are
two label propagation semi-supervised (non-parametric) based
models in this package, namely, LabelPropagation and LabelSpreading [26]. These models rely on the geometry of
the data induced by both labeled and unlabeled instances as
opposed to the supervised models which only use the labeled
data [26]. This geometry is usually represented by a graph
G = (V, E), with the nodes V represent the training data
and edges E represent the similarity between them [26] in the
form of weight matrix W. Given the graph G, a basic approach
for semi-supervised learning is through propagating labels on
the graph [26]. Due to the higher performance achieved, we
chose to use LabelSpreading model. We conducted experiment
with the two built-in kernels radial basis function (RBF) and
K-nearest neighbor (KNN) in label propagation models and
report the results in Table III. Note that we only reported the
precision when 119 negative samples (labeled by either of the
experts) were used in the learning process. We did so because
of the reasonable number of the positive labels assigned by
either of the kernels in presence of these negative instances
(our experts had limited time to validate the labels of the data).
As we see from this table, out of 849 unlabeled data, our
learner with RBF and KNN kernels assigned positive labels
to the 145 and 188 instances, respectively. Next, we pass the
identified positive labels to the experts for further verification.
Our approach with RBF and KNN correctly identified 134

VIII. C ONCLUSION
Readily available online data from escort advertisements
could be leveraged in favor of fighting against the human
trafficking. In this study, having focused on textual information
from available data crawled from Backpage.com, we identified if an escort advertisement can be reflective of human
trafficking activities. More specifically, we first propose an
unsupervised filtering approach to filter out the data which
are more likely involved in trafficking. We then trained a

semi-supervised learner on small portion of such data, handlabeled by human trafficking experts, to identify the labels for
unseen data. The results suggest our non-parametric approach
is successful at identifying the potential human trafficking
related advertisements.
In future work we seek to extract the underlying network of
the data to find interesting patterns such as the most influential
nodes as they might indicate the known pimps and traffickers.
We would also like to replicate the study by integrating
more features, especially those supported by the criminology
literature.
