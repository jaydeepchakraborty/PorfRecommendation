Abstract. Stock market news and investing tips are popular topics in Twitter. In this paper, first we utilize a 5-year financial news corpus comprising over 50,000 articles collected from the NASDAQ website matching the 30 stock symbols in Dow Jones Index (DJI) to train a directional stock price prediction system based on news content. Next, we proceed to show that information in articles indicated by breaking Tweet volumes leads to a statistically significant boost in the hourly directional prediction accuracies for the DJI stock prices mentioned in these articles. Secondly, we show that using document-level sentiment extraction does not yield a statistically significant boost in the directional predictive accuracies in the presence of other 1-gram keyword features. Thirdly we test the performance of our system on several time-frames and identify the 4 hour time-frame for both the price charts and for Tweet breakout detection as the best time-frame combination. Finally, we develop a set of price momentum based trade exit rules to cut losing trades early and to allow the winning trades run longer. We show that the Tweet volume breakout based trading system with the price momentum based exit rules not only improves the winning accuracy and the return on investment, but it also lowers the maximum drawdown and achieves the highest overall return over maximum drawdown. Keywords: stock prediction, breaking news mining, Twitter analysis, Twitter volume spike, stock trading systems

1. Introduction Online social networks, like Twitter, are enabling people who are passionate about trading and investing to break critical financial news faster and they also go deep into relevant areas of research and sources leading to real-time insights. Recently Twitter has been used to detect and forecast civil unrest [12], criminal incidents [30], box-office revenues of movies [9], and seasonal influenza [8]. Stock market news and investing tips are popular topics in Twitter. In this paper, first we utilize a 5-year financial news corpus comprising over 50,000 articles collected from the NASDAQ website for the 30 stock symbols in Dow Jones Index (DJI) to train a directional stock price prediction system based on news content. Next we collect over 750,000 Tweets during a 6 month period in 2014 that mention at least one of the 30 DJI stock symbols. We utilize the 68-95-99.7 rule, also known as the three-sigma rule or empirical rule [25], to

define a simple method for detecting hourly stock symbol related Tweet volume breakouts. Then we proceed to test our hypothesis to determine if "information in articles indicated by breaking Tweet volumes will lead to a statistically significant boost in the hourly directional prediction accuracies for the prices of DJI stocks mentioned in these articles". The contributions of the paper can be summarized as follows: ­ Firstly, we show that sparse logistic regression [19] for this text based classification task with 1gram keyword features filtered by a Chi2 [18] feature selection algorithm lead to the best overall directional prediction accuracy among a set of other classifiers and feature sets that we tested. ­ Secondly, we show that using document-level sentiment extraction does not yield to a statistically significant boost in the predictive accuracies in the presence of other 1-gram keyword features.

­ Thirdly, we show that information in articles indicated by Tweet volume breakouts leads to a statistically significant boost in the hourly directional prediction accuracies for the DJI stocks mentioned in the articles linked by Tweets. ­ Fourthly, we compare the performance of the breaking Tweet volumes based trading system on different time-frames. We identify the 4 hour time-frame for both price charts and for Tweet volume breakouts detection as the best timeframe. ­ Finally, we develop a set of price momentum based trade exit rules to cut losing trades early and to allow the winning trades run longer. We show that the Tweet volume breakouts based trading system with the momentum based trade exit rules not only improves the average winning accuracy and the return on investment, but it also lowers the maximum drawdown and yields the highest overall return over maximum drawdown (RoMaD). The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents related work. Section 3 presents the problem definition for the directional prediction of stock prices. The design of experiments to evaluate the performance of various trading systems and strategies are presented

in Section 4. Section 5 describes the experimental data we used and the simulated financial backtesting results for the experiments. Section 6 concludes the paper and discusses future work.

2. Related Work Table 1 contains a summary of previous research findings related to stock price or direction prediction; the input data sets used, the time-frames used for prediction, the length of the period of collected data, prediction algorithms used, and the resulting overall accuracies. These systems have different prediction time-frames and goals. Some of them predict stock price for the intended time-frame like [26], [27] and [21]. Time frames vary between next 20 minutes to up to next month. Works such as [10], [14], [15], [16], [22] , [24], and [29] predict stock price direction for the next day. [23] aims to predict the price direction every 2-hours, and [13] aims to predict monthly direction. Related systems collected their input data from various sources and exchanges: [27], [22], and [21] collected stock news, Tweets and price charts related to S&P 500 companies. [29] collected Tweets and stock price data related to Nasdaq stocks, [10] collected

Tweets and stock price charts related to Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA), [15] collected one year of data related to Microsoft company. [13] collected stock price charts from Shenzhen Development Stock A (SDSA) exchange. [23] collected currency price and news data related to foreign exchange market (Forex). [24] collected stock price data from CNX Nifty, S&P BSE Sensex exchanges and finally [26] collected thirteen years of stock price charts data related to Goldman Sachs Group Inc. [13], [24], and [26] used only stock price as input to predict stock price or direction with accuracies varying between 83% and 90%. [14], [15], [16], and [23] are examples of papers which utilize news as well as stock prices to predict price direction with varying accuracies between 51% and 83%. [22] made correlation analysis between the stock price and the Tweet volume, and used it to predict stock market direction with 68% accuracy. Following work by [21] analyzed Tweet spikes in combination with price action based technical indicators such as price breakout direction as an input to a Bayesian classifier for stock price prediction, yielding a daily average gain of approximately 0.3% during a period of 55 days generating a total gain of 15%. [10] used extracted sentiment information from Twitter data and a neural network classifier to predict Dow Jones Industrial average (DJIA) daily price direction with 88% accuracy. [29] also used sentiment information extracted from Twitter as input to a decision tree classifier to predict price direction for four companies in NASDAQ stock exchange with average accuracy of 77% distributed as APPL at 77%, GOOG at 77%, MSFT at 69% and AMZN at 85% during a two months period of evaluations.

3. Problem Definition The correction effect of online news articles covering company related events, announcements and technical analyst reports on the stock price may take some time to show. Depending on the severity and impact of the news announcement this period may vary between few minutes to an hour, and the effect may sometimes determine the trend direction of the financial instrument for upcoming weeks or months. One way to measure the impact of news on a stock price is to analyze the trading volume following the news announcement. Another indicator of news impact is the diffusion rates and volumes of messages on so-

cial media containing the stock symbol and news links of interest. Twitter provides a suitable platform to investigate properties of such information diffusion. Diffusion analysis can harness social media to investigate "viral Tweets" to create early-warning indicators that can signal if a breakout started to emerge in its nascent stages. In this paper, we utilize the 68-95-99.7 rule to define a simple method of Tweet volume breakouts. In statistics, the 68-95-99.7 rule, also known as the three-sigma rule or empirical rule [25], states that nearly all values lie within three standard deviations ( ) of the mean (µ) in a normal distribution. We utilize a fixed sized sliding window (of length 20 hour intervals that was determined experimentally), to compute a running average and standard deviation for the hourly volumes of Tweets that mention a stock symbol. Then, we identify breakout signals within a time-series of hourly Tweet volumes for each stock symbol whenever its hourly volume exceeds (µ(20) + 2 ) of the previous 20 hour periods. We consider a breakout as an indication that traders or technical analysts are sharing some exciting or important new information regarding the company or a group of companies. Next, we collect the URL links mentioned within the breaking-news hour of Tweets and we designed a pair of experiments to test the hypothesis whether "information in news indicated by breaking Tweet volumes will lead to statistically significant boost in the directional prediction accuracy for the prices of the related stock symbols mentioned in these articles". Our system has the following characteristics: 1. Input Data: Hourly stock price charts of the 30 stocks comprising the Dow Jones Index (DJI), online stock news articles for a 5 year period spanning 2010 and 2014 from NASDAQ1 news website, the Tweets related the 30 stock symbols collected from Twitter Streaming API2 spanning a 6 months period between March 2014 and September 2014, and online news articles mentioned in Tweets during breaking news hours. 2. Prediction Time-Frame: The collected data is analyzed and predictions are made on hourly bases. 3. Prediction Goal: To predict the hourly price direction for the stocks mentioned in Tweets during breaking news hours. The distinguishing features of our system compared to systems mentioned in the related work section are:

(1) [21] used Tweeter volume spikes alongside stock price-based technical indicators for stock price turning point prediction where as our system utilizes textual content of the news mentioned in Tweets during breaking Twitter volume hours to predict the hourly direction of the stock price following a breakout period. (2) [10] and [29] used extracted sentiment information alongside stock price-based technical indicators to determine if sentiment information leads to a boost in the predicted direction accuracy. Our system primarily relies on textual content of the news linked from breaking Tweet volumes to predict the direction of the stock price in the next hour. We also experimented with extracted sentiment as an additional feature to determine if it leads to a boost in the overall prediction accuracy. Unlike [10] and [29], our system did not experience a statistically significant boost in predictive accuracies as a result of including sentiment information alongside other textual content features. [10]'s accuracy is not comparable to ours since they are reporting the daily directional prediction accuracy for the Dow Jones Index Average (DJIA). Compared to predictive accuracies for four companies listed in [29], we have only one stock in common with their experiments, i.e. MSFT, where their system reported a daily directional predictive accuracy of 69% and our system reported an hourly directional accuracy of 82%.

4. Design of Experiments In order to test the hypothesis that "information in news indicated by breaking Tweet volumes will lead to statistically significant boost in the directional prediction accuracy for the prices of the relevant stock sym-

bols mentioned in such articles", we designed two experiments. In the first experiment we trained a classifier using all stock news articles for a 5 year period spanning 2010 and 2014 from NASDAQ news website. Figure 1 illustrates the system architecture used for the first experiment. For comparison purposes we experimented with three different types of features extracted from text: 1-gram keywords, 2-gram phrases, and bi-polar sentiment (i.e. positive and negative) extracted from text. We grouped news hourly, and categorized each hourly collection as one of two categories: (1) those that led to an increased stock price or (2) those that led to a price reduction during the next hour. Next, we applied a feature selection method to reduce the number of features to only relevant ones. The details of these steps are presented in Section 4.1. Finally we experimented with two types of text classifiers and evaluated their directional predictive accuracy using 10-fold cross validation. The results of the first experiment utilizing all stock news for all 30 company stocks are reported in Section 5.2. In our second experiment, we tested the directional predictive accuracy of our classifier (i.e. trained in the first experiment above) using only online articles collected during hourly breaking Tweet volume periods. Figure 2 illustrates the system architecture used for our second experiment. Steps involved in the second experiment were hourly profiling of the Tweets mentioning a stock symbol, detection of Tweet volume breakout periods, collection of online news mentioned in Tweets during the breaking hours, feature extraction from news, and running of the classifier to predict the stock price direction of the next hour using the collected news content. We compared the accuracies of the classifiers in both first and second experiments to test the validity of

H. alostad et al. / Directional Prediction of Stock Prices using Breaking News on Twitter

our hypothesis. The details of the steps involved in the second experiment are explained in Section 4.2, and the experimental results and evaluations are presented in Section 5.3. 4.1. Experiment-1: Hourly Price Direction Prediction using Online News The following is a detailed description of each step used in Experiment-1: 1. One Hour Stock Chart: We collected hourly stock financial price charts for all the companies comprising the Dow Jones Index (DJI) using an API from ActiveTick 3 . For each trading hour the price direction was calculated based on the difference between hourly Open and Close prices according to the Formula 1 below, where d represents the trading date and h represents the trading hour: 1 if Open(d, h)  Close(d, h) ) -1 otherwise (1) 2. Hourly News: We used Web Content Extractor4 to collect online news articles from NASDAQ website. We stored all metadata information related to the articles like their title, url, date, time, and source in a database table. We fetched the news content using their urls and performed content extraction using Boilerpipe5 . 3. Feature Extraction: · N-gram Features from News: R for Text Mining(TM)6 package was used to extract keyword features from the news corpus. First all whitespaces, stop words, numbers, punctuation were removed from the documents, then all the terms were converted to lowercase and stemmed into their root words. Next features were recorded in a document-term matrix. For each stock symbol we created a pair of document-term matrices: one with 1-gram features and another with 2-gram features represented in a binary form. We used R.Matlab7 package to create Matlab format files for these matrices.

Dir(d, h) =

· Sentiment Features: To detect sentiment in news content we used a Java version of SentiStrength library8 . SentiStrength is a classifier that uses a predefined sentiment word list with human polarity and strength judgments, then it applies rules to detect sentiment in short text [28]. [20] showed that using general word lists for sentiment analysis of large financial text leads into mis-classification of common words in the financial domain. So alongside SentiStrenght dictionary [20] we also used Loughran and McDonald Financial Sentiment Dictionaries9 to compute sentiment. Besides using different sentiment word lists, we also need to get the sentiment for each document. We used OpenNLP10 Sentence Detector to extract sentences mentioning a stock symbol from each document, and then we applied the SentiStrenght classifier on each sentence. We determined the majority polarity for the sentences contained in a document and used the majority polarity (i.e. positive or negative) as the sentiment for each stock symbol mentioned in the document. 4. Feature Selection: Feature selection in text mining reduces the number of features to only relevant and discriminative set of features. We used Chi2 [18] feature selection algorithm from a feature selection package 11 . Chi2 is a two phase general algorithm that automatically selects a proper critical value for statistical 2 test and then it removes all irrelevant and redundant features [18]. 5. News Labeling: Figure 3 is an illustration of the news labeling step. In this phase we used the stock price direction of the following hour to categorize the directionality of the hourly collections of news articles. In order to align the news article hours with the stock chart hours we had to standardize and adjust their time zones. Formula 2 is used to label the news articles where d represents the publishing date, and h represents the publishing hour. Label(d, h) = Dir(d, N ext(h)) (2)

In this paper we initially assume that the effect of published news articles will be reflected on the

stock price direction during the next hour. Later we relax this assumption and test the system for all time periods varying between 5 mins up to 4 hours. Formula 2 applies to all the news articles published during official trading hours which starts at 9AM and ends on 3PM in EST time zone. For articles that are published during the last trading hour, or after trading hours, or during holidays and weekends we assumed that their effect will be seen on the direction of the first trading hour of the next trading day. For this case Formula 3 is used to label those news articles. Label(d, h) = Dir(N ext(d), F irst(h)) (3) 6. Classifier: We formulate price direction prediction problem as a classification problem in a general structured sparse learning framework [19]. In particular, the logistical regression formulation presented below fits this application, since it is a dichotomous classification problem (e.g. upwards vs. downwards price correction), In the formula 4, ai is the vector representation of the news during the ith hour, wi is the weight assigned to the ith document (wi =1/m by default), and A=[a1 , a2 ,  e, am ] is the document n-gram matrix, yi is the âA directionality of each hour based upon the stock price action of the next hour, and the unknown xj , the j-th element of x, is the weight for each ngram feature,  > 0 is a regularization parameter that controls the sparsity of the solution, |x|1 = |xi | is 1-norm of the x vector. We used the SLEP [19] sparse learning package that utilizes

gradient descent approach to solve the above convex and non-smooth optimization problem. The n-grams with non-zero values on the sparse x vector yield the discriminant factors for classifying a news collection as leading to upwards or downwards price correction. n-grams with positive polarity correspond to upward direction indicators, and those with negative polarity correspond to downward direction indicators.

We also utilized an SVM classifier in our experiments using LIBSVM12 library. 7. 10-fold cross validation: We run a total of 8 experiments for each stock symbol where we experimented: (1) with SVM and sparse logistic regression classifiers, (2) with 1-gram and 2-gram features, and (3) with and without extracted sentiment features. After the training phase of the classifier, we validated the accuracies using 10fold cross validation. The evaluation results for the first experiment are presented in Section 5.2.

4.2. Experiment-2: Hourly Price Direction Prediction using Breaking News We selected the classifier with the best performance emerging from Experiment-1 to use in Experiment-2. Experiment-2 was designed to test if the online news indicated by breaking Tweet volumes would lead to a statistically significant boost in the directional prediction accuracy for the prices of the relevant stock symbols mentioned in such news. The system architecture figure in Figure 2 shows the steps used in this experiment. The following is a detailed description of each step: 1. Twitter Stock Symbol Feed: Twitter streaming API was used to collect Tweets related to companies in the Dow Jones Index (DJI). In order to collect relevant Tweets we used a keyword filter made from the stock symbols, either prefixed by a dollar sign ($) or prefixed by "NYSE:" or "NASDAQ:". For example, the keyword filter for Microsoft Corporation are $MSFT and NYSE:MSFT. For each matching Tweet we stored the stock symbol, Tweet text, date, time, and the set of URLs mentioned in the Tweet. If the Tweet text contained more than one stock symbol then we stored the same Tweet information for each mentioned stock symbol. 2. Hourly Tweets Volume Profiling: We utilize a fixed sized sliding window (of length 20 hour intervals) where the 20 hour intervals was determined by conducting several experiments with different intervals, to compute a running average

µ[20] and standard deviation  for the hourly volumes of Tweets that mention a stock symbol. 3. Tweets Volume Breakout Hour: We identify breakout signals within a time-series of hourly Tweet volumes for each stock symbol using Formula 5.

Breakout =

T rue if N (d, h)  µ[20](d, h) + 2 (d, h)) F alse otherwise (5)

In Formula 5, N represents Tweet volume on specific date d, and hour h. µ[20] is 20-hour simple moving average applied on Tweets' volume, µ[20](d, h) + 2 (d, h) represents the upper band for simple moving average - a 20-hour moving average plus 2-times standard deviation. If the volume of hourly Tweets N exceeds the upper band value, this would indicate a volume breakout. Otherwise the Tweet volume is non-breaking. In Figure 4, the pair of dotted arrows shows two instances of Tweet volume breakouts at 9/5/2014 at 9AM and 9/5/2014 at 2PM, where the corresponding articles from these hours will be used to predict the price directions of the mentioned stocks at the following hours. 4. News From Breaking Tweets: In this step the news content of URLs found in the Tweets during the breaking hours are downloaded and their textual contents are extracted using the following steps:

(a) For each breaking hour of a specific stock symbol we fetch the URLs found in Tweets during the breaking hour, i.e. Breakout = True. In some cases the URLs were mentioned in their short URL forms, so before fetching them, they were converted to their long forms. (b) Fetch the URL links' content and perform content extraction from the HTML documents using the JSoup HTML parser 13 . 5. Classifier: After extracting the hourly breaking news and their 1-gram features we utilized the logistic regression classifier to predict the price direction for the next hour. 6. Evaluation: The predictive accuracies of the news classifier for the price direction following the breaking Tweet volume hours are presented in Section 5.3. 4.3. Experiment-3: Comparison Between Different Time-Frames For Price Direction Prediction using Breaking News In Experiment-3 we used the same steps of the system architecture of Experiment-2 shown in Figure 2, but instead of using the 1 hour time-frame for news grouping and the price direction labeling, we tested the prediction performance of the news content based classifier using all possible time-frame combinations (i.e. 4 hours, 1 hour, 30 minutes, 15 minutes, and 5 minutes) for both news grouping and news price effects labeling. Table 2 lists the evaluated time-frame combinations for news grouping and news effect labeling. The goal of this experiment is to identify the best time-frame combination that should be used for (i) news grouping and (ii) news effect labeling which yields the highest directional stock price prediction accuracy. The findings of Experiment-3 is presented in Section 5.4.

4.4. Experiment-4: Tweets Volume Breakout based Trading System We selected the classifier with the best performance emerging from Experiment-3 for use in Experiment4. Experiment-4 is designed to test if prediction with the online news linked from breaking Tweet volumes would lead to a higher performance directional stock price prediction system. Figure 5 shows the flowchart of the proposed system for Experiment-4. The following are the trade entry and exit rules that we used: 1. ENTER a trade at the beginning of the next trade period, if there was a Tweet volume breakout for Tweets matching a stock's symbol in the preceding time-frame. 2. The trade DIRECTION (i.e. buy or sell) is determined by the news content-based classifier applied to the content linked from the Tweets matching a stock's symbol during the proceeding Tweet volume breakout period. 3. EXIT the trade at the end of the next time-frame period. 4. Evaluate the performance of the resulting trade (i.e. a win or a loss) and the corresponding amount according to the real stock price movement during the trade period. In order to evaluate the performance of the above trading system we performed a backtesting of the system on real data, recorded the outcomes of its trades accounting for its wins and losses, as follows: ­ Percentage of winning trades (Won%) ­ Percentage of long positions (Long Won%) ­ Percentage of short positions (Short Won%) ­ Percentage of Return On Investment (ROI%) according to Equation 6 ROI = Gain - Cost Cost (6)

ROI is a performance measure used to evaluate the efficiency of an investment or to compare the

H. alostad et al. / Directional Prediction of Stock Prices using Breaking News on Twitter

efficiency of a number of different investments [5]. The higher the value of ROI% the better. ­ Percentage of Maximum Drawdown (MDD%), is the maximum loss from a peak to a trough of a portfolio, before a new peak is attained. It is an indicator of downside risk over a specified time period [3]. The lower the value of MDD% the better for investment. ­ Return Over Maximum Drawdown (RoMaD) shown in Equation 7 ROI M DD

4.5. Experiment-5: Price Momentum Based Trade EXIT Rules In this experiment we develop a set of price momentum based trade exit rules to cut losing trades early and to allow the winning trades run longer. We apply these price momentum based EXIT rules to the trading system developed in Experiment-4, and compare their performance in Section 5.6. The rules are based on the Squeeze Momentum Indicator [7], which is a derivative of John Carter's "TTM Squeeze" volatility indicator [11]. This indicator has been used to detect periods while the market is quiet (i.e. squeeze) and the periods while the market is volatile (i.e. price breakouts). Squeeze Momentum Indicator is comprised of three components: 1. Bollinger Bands [2].
U pperBollingerBand = µ[20] + 2, LowerBollingerBand = µ[20] - 2, M iddleBollingerBand = µ[20] where µ[20] is the average of the closing prices for the previous 20 time-periods and  is their standard deviation. (8)

RoM aD =

(7)

RoMad is a risk-adjusted return metric. It enables investors to ask the question: Are they willing to accept an occasional drawdown of X% in order to generate an average return of Y%? [6], for example: An investment with a MDD of 20% and ROI= 10% (RoMAD = 2.0) would be considered the more attractive investment than one with a MDD of 50% and a ROI of 10% (RoMAD = 0.2). The experimental results for the Tweets volume breakout based trading system are presented in Section 5.5.

2. Keltner Channels [4].
U pperChanelLine = µ[20] + 2AT R(10), LowerChanelLine = µ[20] - 2AT R(10) (9)

where ATR [1] is defined as follows:
AT R(t) = AT R(t - 1) × (n - 1) + T R n

where Momentum is the difference between the current close values to the average of the average between highest high of the previous 20 time periods and lowest low of the previous 20 time periods, to the average of the closing prices for the previous 20 time-periods. Figure 6 illustrates the Squeeze Momentum Indicator components. The Squeeze Momentum Indicator is used as follows: It signals a red dot when the Bollinger Bands are inside of the Keltner Channel, whence the market is said to be in a squeeze. Otherwise, it signals a green dot signaling that the market is volatile (i.e. price breakout). In order to determine the direction of the volatility, we inspect the sign of the Momentum Indicator. If it is positive, then the price momentum is in the upward direction, otherwise it is in the downward direction. The momentum based trade EXIT rules are defined as follows: ­ Cut Losses Early (CLE) EXIT Rule is defined in Section 4.5.1. ­ Conservative Let the Winners Run (ConsLWR) EXIT Rule is defined in Section 4.5.2.

T R = max[(high - low), abs(high, closeP rev ), abs(low - closeprev )]

where t is the current time, n=10, and true range T R is the largest of either the most recent period's high minus the most recent period's low, or the absolute value of the most recent period's high minus the previous close, or the absolute value of the most recent period's low minus the previous close. 3. Momentum Indicator [7].
M omentum = close[0] - µ[µ[highest[high, 20] , lowest[low, 20]], µ[20]] (10)

­ Aggressive Let the Winners Run (AggLWR) EXIT Rule is defined in Section 4.5.3 ­ Cut Losses Early (CLE) + Conservative Let the Winners Run (ConsLWR) EXIT Rule is defined in Section 4.5.4 ­ Cut Losses Early (CLE) + Aggressive Let the Winners Run (AggLWR) EXIT Rule is defined in Section 4.5.5 4.5.1. Trading with Cut Losses Early (CLE) EXIT Rule This rule applies during the initial fixed time-period of the trade, where we track the price action on the 5 minute chart to cut the losses early if the price is volatile and the Momentum Indicator points to a direction that is opposite to that of the trade's direction. 1. Stock price is volatile and not in a squeeze period i.e. TTM squeeze indicator should be off (i.e. green) 2. The momentum indicator for the previous pair of bars are rising in an opposite direction. ­ Long EXIT: Momentum indicator for the previous pair of bars are both negative and declining. ­ Short EXIT: Momentum indicator for the previous pair of bars are positive and rising. 4.5.2. Trading with the Conservative Let the Winners Run (ConsLWR) EXIT Rule In this strategy a trade is allowed to run, past its fixed time period, if it is in profit at the end of its fixed timeperiod and while the following conditions remain true on the 5 minute price chart: ­ Long/Buy Continuation: Momentum indicator for the previous pair of bars are rising. ­ Short/Sell Continuation: Momentum indicator for the previous pair of bars are declining. The trade is exited, using the 5 minute chart when one of the following conditions are met: ­ Long/Buy EXIT: Momentum indicator for the previous pair of bars are declining. ­ Short/Sell EXIT: Momentum indicator for the previous pair of bars are rising. 4.5.3. Trading with the Aggressive Let the Winners Run (AggLWR) EXIT Rule In this strategy a trade is allowed to run, past its fixed time period, if it is in profit at the end of its fixed timeperiod and while the following conditions remain true on the 5 minute price chart: ­ Long/Buy Continuation: Momentum indicator for the previous pair of bars are positive.

­ Short/Sell Continuation: Momentum indicator for the previous pair of bars are negative. The trade is exited, using the 5 minute chart when one of the following conditions are met: ­ Long EXIT: Momentum indicator for the previous bar is negative (i.e. opposite direction) ­ Short EXIT: Momentum indicator for the previous bar is positive (i.e. opposite direction) 4.5.4. CLE + ConsLWR Trading Strategy This strategy combines the CLE exit rule during the initial time-frame with the ConsLWR rule following the initial time-frame. 4.5.5. CLE + AggLWR Trading Strategy This strategy combines the CLE exit rule during the initial time-frame with the AggLWR rule following the initial time-frame. The detailed results of financial back-testing of the Tweets volume breakout trading system with the price momentum based trade EXIT rules are presented in Section 5.6.

5. Experimental Results and Evaluations 5.1. Experimental Data We collected online news articles and stock price charts related to 30 stock symbols in Dow Jones Index for the period between October, 2009 and September, 2014. We also collected Tweets matching stock symbols for the period between March, 2014 and September, 2014. The total number of news articles collected from the NASDAQ website for the 30 stock symbols in Dow Jones Index is 53,641. The total number of collected Tweets matching 30 stock symbols is 780,139. Table 3 shows the number of news articles, total number of collected Tweets, and the number of hourly breakout periods for each symbol. 5.2. Experiment-1: Hourly Price Direction Prediction using Online News We executed the steps described in Figure 1 on data sets collected for the 30 Dow Jones Index companies. In order to identify the best set of text features and the best classifier we had to perform several experiments. We run a total of 8 experiments for each stock symbol where we experimented: (1) with SVM and sparse logistic regression classifiers, (2) with 1-gram and 2-gram keyword features, and (3) with and with-

out extracted sentiment for documents. After the training phase of the classifier, we validated the accuracies using 10-fold cross validation. The results for this first experiment is presented in Table 4. The bold numbers on each row indicate the experimental setup which led to the best accuracy for each stock symbol. Figure 7 also shows the whisker plot for Experiment-1 results. The evaluations show that 1-gram features led to higher overall accuracies compared to 2-gram features for both SVM and LogisticR experiments. Also, the experimental setup with the LogisticR classifier using 1-Gram features where the sentiment features were excluded led to the maximal accuracies in 19 out of 30 cases. The second best experimental setup that achieved the maximal accuracies was also with the LogisticR classifier with 1-gram features integrated with the sentiment feature. Hence, in order to determine the utility of extracted sentiment features we formulated the following hypotheses and applied the nonparametric sign test [17] at confidence level 95% to test if sentiment features would yield a statistically significant boost in the overall prediction accuracies:

1. Null Hypothesis (h0): 1-gram LogisticR classifier without sentiment features accuracies' mean = 1gram LogisticR classifier with sentiment accuracies' mean, indicating that they are at the same level of performance. 2. Alternative Hypothesis (h1): 1-gram LogisticR classifier without sentiment features accuracies' mean = 1-gram LogisticR classifier with sentiment features accuracies' mean, indicating that they are not at the same level of performance. The p-value of the sign test to compare 1-gram LogisticR classifier without sentiment features with 1-gram LogisticR classifier with sentiment features at significance level 0.05 equals to 0.1221, which leads to the acceptance of the null hypothesis h0 and the rejection of the alternative hypothesis h1, concluding that using sentiment would not yield a statistically significant boost in the overall prediction accuracy in this setup.

5.3. Experiment-2: Hourly Price Direction Prediction using Breaking News In Experiment-2 we applied steps outlined in Figure 2 to 30 stock symbols in Dow Jones Index using breaking news periods only as trade triggers. Table 5 shows that Experiment-2 led to a boost in predictive accuracies for 70% of the stock symbols (i.e. 21 out of 30 cases). In order to prove that Experiment-2 yields a statistically significant boost in prediction accuracy compared to Experiment-1 we applied sign test at confidence level 95%. We formulated the following hypotheses: 1. Null Hypothesis (h0): Experiment-1 accuracies mean = Experiment-2 accuracies mean, indicating that they are at the same level of performance. 2. Alternative Hypothesis (h1): Experiment-1 accuracies mean = Experiment-2 accuracies mean, indicating that they are not at the same level of performance. The p-value of the sign test to compare Experiment-1 with Experiment-2 at significance level 0.05 equals to 0.0357, which leads to the rejection of the null hypothesis h0 and the accepting of the alternative hypothesis h1 thus confirming that using 1-gram based LogisticR classifier with breaking news yields a statistically significant boost in directional prediction accuracy for 30 DJI stocks compared to using the same classifier with all of the stock news every hour. 5.4. Experiment-3: Comparison Between Different Time-frames For Price Direction Prediction using Breaking News 13 pairs of time-frame combinations were tested in Experiment-3 where we applied the steps outlined in Figure 2 to each of the 30 stock symbols in Dow Jones Index using breaking news periods. Table 6 shows that in this experiment 4h4h time-frame combination yields the best average predictive accuracy for the price direction. This experiment indicates that (i) the 4 hour

time period is the best time-period for detecting Tweet volume breakouts, and (ii) the 4 hour time-period is also the best time-frame to label and predict the trend direction following a Tweet volume breakout session. 5.5. Experiment-4: Tweets Volume Breakout based Trading System We performed a simulated financial evaluation of the proposed trading system by back-testing its trades and accounting for its return on investment (ROI%) for a period of 6 months, between March 2014 and September 2014. In this simulation it is assumed that no commissions or fees are charged for each trade. Since the 4h4h time-frame yield the best accuracy results from Experiment-3 the system was tested using the 4 hours breaking Tweets on the 4 hour stock chart, for its trade entries and exists. The system entered a trade following a Tweet volume breakout session for Tweets matching a stock's symbol, with a trade fired in the direction (e.g. a long/buy or short/sell trade) predicted by our classifier based on the content that was collected by following the links from the Tweets during the breakout period, for a fixed duration of 4 hours. For each company, we measured the percentage of winning trades (Won%), percentage of long positions (Long Won%), percentage of short positions (Short Won%), return on investment (ROI%), maximum drawdown (MDD%), and risk adjusted return over maximum drawdown (RoMad). Table 7 shows the results of the simulated backtesting evaluations. The results show that during this period our system was profitable overall on its recommended trades with each stock symbol. Since each stock has a different stock price, we performed simulated trading using a diversified portfolio based on equal exposure to risk or gains from each stock in order to calculate the total and monthly average return on investment (ROI%). The simulated trades show that trading with the system during the 6 months period results in a winning ratio of 74% for its long/buy direc-

5.6. Experiment-5: Tweets Breakout Stock Trading System with Price Momentum Based Trade EXIT Rules We performed a simulated financial evaluation of the Tweets breakout stock trading system with the price momentum based trade EXIT rules defined in Section 4.5. Table 8 shows a comparison of the average results of the proposed trading strategies based on the Won%, Short Won%, Long Won%, ROI%, MDD, and RoMaD. The results show that Tweets Breakout+CLE+AggLWR trading strategy yielded the best risk adjusted return metric value (RoMad) of 9.5 meaning that, this system would yield 9.5% returns for an occasional drawdown risk of 1%, or 95% returns for an occasional drawdown risk of 10%, essentially almost doubling the initial investment in 6 months. The second best trading strategy was obtained by the Tweets Breakout + CLE + ConsLWR with RoMaD value of 8.5.

for detecting Tweet volume breakouts, and it is also as the best time-frame for the price-charts to label and predict the trend direction following a Tweet volume breakout session. Finally, we develop price momentum based trade exit rules to cut losing trades early and to allow the winning trades run longer. We show that the Tweet volume breakout based trading system with the momentum based exit rules not only improves the winning accuracy and the return on investment, but it also lowers the maximum drawdown and achieves the highest overall return over maximum drawdown. Our future work includes developing a real-time distributed trading system to monitor the Tweeter streams of different categories of stocks (i.e. large cap, mid cap and small cap) and trade with the their breaking volumes. We also plan to develop online learning methods to maintain the currency of the predictive models. References

6. Conclusion and Future Work In this paper we start with a system to predict the hourly stock price direction based on the textual analysis of news articles' content mentioning a stock symbol. First, we show that using LogisticR classifier with 1-gram keyword features leads to the best overall directional prediction accuracy based on news articles. Next, we showed that using extracted document-level sentiment features do not yield to a statistically significant boost in directional predictive accuracies in the presence of other 1-gram features. Then, we proceed to show that information in articles indicated by breaking Tweet volumes leads to a statistically significant boost in the hourly directional prediction accuracies for the prices of DJI stocks mentioned in these articles. We experiment with all time-frame combinations and identify the 4h time period as the best time-period
