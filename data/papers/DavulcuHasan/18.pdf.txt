Abstract—Blogosphere plays an increasingly important role
as a forum for public debate. In this paper, given a mixed set
of blogs debating a set of political issues from opposing camps,
we use signed bipartite graphs for modeling debates, and we
propose an algorithm for partitioning both the blogs, and the
issues (i.e. topics, leaders, etc.) comprising the debate into binary
opposing camps. Simultaneously, our algorithm scales both the
blogs and the underlying issues on a univariate scale. Using
this scale, a researcher can identify moderate and extreme blogs
within each camp, and polarizing vs. unifying issues. Through
performance evaluations we show that our proposed algorithm
provides an effective solution to the problem, and performs
much better than existing baseline algorithms adapted to solve
this new problem. In our experiments, we used both real data
from political blogosphere and US Congress records, as well
as synthetic data which were obtained by varying polarization
and degree distribution of the vertices of the graph to show the
robustness of our algorithm.

I NTRODUCTION

Blogosphere plays an increasingly important role [1] as
a forum of public debate, with knock-on consequences for
the media, politics, and policy. Hotly debated issues span
all spheres of human activity; from liberal vs. conservative
politics, to extremist vs. counter-extremist religious debate, to
climate change debate in scientific community, to globalization
debate in economics, and to nuclear disarmament debate in
security. There are many applications [2], [3], [4], [5], [6]
for recognizing politically-oriented sentiment in texts. Previous
work [7] studied linking patterns and discussion topics of
political bloggers by measuring the degree of interaction
between liberal and conservative blogs, and to uncover their
differences. In this paper, given a mixed set of blogs debating
a set of related issues from two opposing camps, we propose
an algorithm to determine (i) which blog lies in which camp,
(ii) what are the contested issues, and, (iii) who are mentioned
as the key individuals within each camp.
Bipartite graphs [8], [9], [10] have been widely used to
represent relationships between two sets of entities. We use
bipartite graphs to model the relationships between blogs
and issues (i.e. topics, individuals, etc.) mentioned within
blogs. We use signed weighted edges to represent opinion
strengths, where positive edges denote support, and negative
edges denote opposition between a blog and an issue.
We develop algorithms to solve the following problems on
signed bipartite graphs modeling blog debates:

1)
2)

Partitioning of both the blogs, and the underlying
issues mentioned in blogs, into two opposing camps;
Scaling of both the blogs and the underlying issues
on a univariate scale such that the position of a
vertex is closer to the positions of the vertices it
is connected with positive edges, and further away
from the positions of the vertices it is connected with
negative edges.

Using this scale, a researcher can identify both the moderate and extreme blogs within each camp, and the polarizing
vs. unifying issues. Partitioning and scaling help a researcher
to better understand the structure of a social, political or
economic debate, or even the details of an emerging geopolitical conflict in the world. While extremist ends of a scale,
may represent blogs with irreconcilable viewpoints, in some
cases, moderate blogs may represent viewpoints that are more
amenable to engage in a constructive dialog through a set
of unifying issues. Moderates may sympathize with some
of the claims and grievances of the other side. Longitudinal
analysis using our proposed algorithms could reveal interesting
dynamics, such as, moderates from opposing camps could be
in the process of forming a coalition by making the necessary
compromises to reach a consensus. All the while, moderates
may be alienating extremists in their own camps who may
choose to focus on polarizing issues only, and lash out violent
or demonizing rhetoric on everyone else who do not share their
exclusivist viewpoints.
To the best of our knowledge, simultaneous scaling and
partitioning on signed weighted bipartite graphs has not been
studied in the literature, and this paper is the first attempt to
introduce the problem and provide an effective solution and
evaluation strategies.
Major contributions of this paper are: (1) an iterative algorithm, named Alternatingly Normalized CO-HITS (ANCOHITS), to propagate the scores on a signed bipartite graph to
solve the partitioning and scaling problems described above;
(2) a convergence proof for the proposed ANCO-HITS algorithm; (3) definition of a new coefficient to measure structural
equilibrium for signed bipartite graphs using the multiplicative transitivity property presented in [11] exemplified by
the phrase the enemy of my enemy is my friend; and (4)
performance evaluations of blog/issue partitioning and scaling
algorithms using synthetic data sets which were obtained by
varying polarization and degree distribution of signed bipartite
graphs, and analysis with two real data sets: (i) partitioning

and scaling of Republicans/Democrats and their roll call votes1
based on the 111th US Congress voting records, and (iii)
partitioning and scaling of the top 22 liberal and conservative
blogs, and the most influential individuals mentioned in these
blogs.
In our experiments, variance in polarization relates to the
distributions of the ratio of vertices corresponding to extremes
vs. moderates.
Alongside our proposed ANCO-HITS, we also evaluated
two baseline algorithms, namely CO-HITS [8] and spectral
clustering [12]. Although Co-HITS was designed for scaling
unsigned bipartite graphs, it can be directly applied for scaling signed bipartite graphs, and partitioning by considering
the signs of vertex values. Spectral clustering algorithm was
designed for partitioning of graphs, and it can also produce
a scale by using the component values of the eigenvector
associated with the second smallest positive eigenvalue of the
graph Laplacian [13], [14].
Our experiments showed that the ANCO-HITS algorithm
is the only robust algorithm in the presence of variance in
polarization and vertex degrees.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. We review
related work in Section 2. Section 3 presents the problem
formulation. In Sections 4 and 5, we present the spectral
clustering and CO-HITS algorithms as the baselines. In Section 6, we present our proposed ANCO-HITS algorithm, and
its convergence proof. Section 7 presents the definition of
structural equilibrium for signed bipartite graphs. We describe
and report experimental evaluations in Section 8. Finally, we
present conclusions and future work in Section 9.

R ELATED W ORK

Scaling vertices of a graph based on the network structure
rather than individual properties has been of great interest for
more than a decade. Two most well-known algorithms are
the PageRank [15] and the HITS [16] algorithms. They were
designed to rank the vertices of graphs with positive weighted
edges. Spectral analysis show that both PageRank and HITS
algorithms converge. An important distinction between the two
algorithms is that; the HITS algorithm provides two different types of rankings corresponding to hubs and authorities,
whereas PageRank provides only a single ranking.
Many data types from data mining applications can be
modeled as bipartite graphs, examples include terms and
documents in a text corpus, customers and items purchased
in market basket analysis and bloggers writing about current
issues.
Based on variations of HITS and PageRank, many researchers have proposed algorithms. In [8], the authors
propose a modification of the HITS algorithm to work on
bipartite graphs called CO-HITS. The main difference between
HITS and CO-HITS is that; HITS provides two scores for
each vertex, whereas CO-HITS provides one score for each
type of vertex. In this paper, we use CO-HITS as one of the
baseline algorithms, and in order to overcome its deficiencies,
we extend it with normalization steps.

The clustering coefficient was first introduced in [17]
to measure how much multiplicative transitivity property the
graph exhibits, which reflects the tendency of the vertices
to form small groups. In [11], authors define a new coefficient using the multiplicative transitivity for signed graphs
to measure structural equilibrium. In this paper, we define
another coefficient through multiplicative transitivity for signed
bipartite graphs.
Data mining methods such as clustering have been used
quite extensively for exploratory data mining applications [18],
[19]. Clustering analysis [20] provides a partitioning of the
data into subsets, called clusters such that the objects in a
cluster are more similar than those in distinct clusters. Spectral
clustering [21], [12], [13] is a powerful clustering method that
is able to outperform K-means clustering [22] in many cases,
especially when the clusters are non convex. The method is
based on computing the eigenvalues of the normalized version
of the graph Laplacian, and has theoretical connections with
the normalized cut of the graph. In particular when clustering a
bipartite graph into two balanced clusters, the second smallest
positive eigenvalue [13] is the solution to the normalized cut of
the graph. In recent years, several authors have used spectral
clustering to analyze bipartite graphs [10]. Furthermore, some
work has been done to take into account a signed adjacency
matrix by using an augmented adjacency matrix [23]. In this
paper, spectral clustering was also used as one of our baseline
methods for partitioning and scaling signed bipartite graphs.

P ROBLEM F ORMULATION

A. CoScaling for signed bipartite graphs
Given
•

G = (U ∪ V, A) is a bipartite graph consisting of
two disjoint sets of vertices U and V , and a signed
adjacency matrix A

•

U = {u1 , u2 , . . . , um }, a set of m vertices

•

V = {v1 , v2 , . . . , vn }, a set of n vertices

•

A ∈ Rm×n , where aij represents the signed edge
between ui and vj

Find
•

X = (x1 , x2 , . . . , xm ), where xi ∈ R is the assigned
value of the vertex ui

•

Y = (y1 , y2 , . . . , yn ), where yi ∈ R is the assigned
value of the vertex vi

such that
•

sgn(xi ) and sgn(yi ) shall determine the polarity of
the vertices i.e. −1 and +1 as the opposing polarities

•

xi value for a vertex ui should be closer to the
yj values of the vertices that it supports (connects
positively), and further away from the yk values of
the vertices that it opposes (connects negatively). The
magnitudes of xi and yj denote the extremity of the
nodes ui and vj . i.e. magnitudes closer to 0 meaning
more moderate and larger magnitudes meaning more
extreme.

in the presence of non-convex groups of data. This method
has close connections with the normalized cut [12] of the
graph. In particular when clustering a bipartite graph into two
balanced clusters, the second smallest positive eigenvalue of
the Laplacian matrix [21] is the solution to the problem of
minimizing the normalized cut of the graph.

Figure 1 depicts a perfectly polarized bipartite graph. The
two axes X and Y represent the univariate scale for the nodes
in U and V . The vertices to the right of zero have positive
values, and the vertices to the left have negative values on
the scale. A green solid line between the nodes ui and vj
represents support, and a red dashed line represents opposition.

Spectral clustering embeds the data into the subspace of
the eigenvectors of the Laplacian. In this paper, we will use
spectral clustering to partition both types of vertices of a signed
bipartite graph into two polarities and provide a scale for the
vertices. We will do this by using the sign and the value of
the components of the eigenvector associated with the smallest
positive eigenvalue of the Laplacian.
Spectral clustering uses an adjacency matrix with all positive entries. However, our problem assumes a signed adjacency
matrix. One of the common techniques to circumvent this
problem is to augment the matrix into a bigger matrix [10],
[25], [24], such that all entries are positive. The first half of
the augmented matrix is reserved for the entries with positive
values, and the second half is reserved for the entries with
negative values.
Define Ã ∈ Rm×2n such that


Ã = A+ , A−

Figure 2 shows an example of two vertices; u1 being
extreme and u2 being more moderate. u1 supports the vertices
of same polarity, and opposes the vertices of the opposite
polarity. However, u2 has mixed support and opposition.

where

Although partitioning algorithms can be utilized to detect
the polarity of vertices, it is not possible to distinguish extremes from moderates. Scaling overcomes this problem and
makes it possible to compare two vertices of same polarity.
In this paper, we are not only able to compare pairs of
vertices, but also provide the exact locations on the scale,
therefore providing valuable information about the shape of
the distribution as well.

and similarly

To solve this co-scaling problem, we present two baseline
methods. The first one is a common modification [24], [10],
[25] of the well-known Spectral Clustering approach to work
on graphs with signed edges. The second one is the COHITS [8] algorithm, that is a modification of the well-known
HITS algorithm, designed for bipartite graphs.
Finally, we compare these baseline methods with a novel
algorithm we developed for co-scaling problem, named Alternatingly Normalized CO-HITS (ANCO-HITS).

Spectral clustering [13] uses spectral graph theory, which
is the study of graphs using linear algebra methods. In this
context, for a given graph, its edge set is represented by
an adjacency matrix. The eigenvectors of the normalized
Laplacian of the adjacency matrix are used to partition the
graph into clusters, where objects in a cluster are more similar
than those in distinct clusters. Spectral clustering incorporates
the properties of a graph via the adjacency matrix and is able to
outperform K-means clustering in many situations, especially

and the following n components are set to be the Y vector,

For this purpose, we propose ANCO-HITS algorithm,
which introduces a normalization mechanism to address the
issue of degree sensitivity of CO-HITS. The proposed method
uses the same iteration procedure described in Algorithm 1.

The drawback of this method is its sensitivity to the degree
of each vertex, in the sense that the higher degree the vertex
has, the higher score it will be assigned on the scale.
For example, let us consider two vertices u1 and u2 with
u1 having a smaller degree than u2 . However, let u1 be more
polarized than u2 as shown in Figure 3. In this scenario,
the corresponding scale values for u1 and u2 should satisfy
|x1 | > |x2 |. But, this will not be the case with the CO-HITS.
This suggests a better algorithm that accounts for the negative
impact of degree variation through some normalization mechanism.

If there exists a vector x∗ that the x<t> will converge in

cx∗ = (BACAT )x∗

(11)

Even though this is an eigenvalue equation, the eigenvalues
may not be real, because the matrix (BACAT ) is not symmetric. But if we multiply each side of the equation with B −1/2 ,

M is a symmetric matrix, and can be shown to be positive
semi-definite with z as an eigenvector c as an eigenvalue. The
M matrix has a set of m eigenvectors that are all unit vectors

and all mutually orthogonal; that is, they form a basis for the

VII.

Bipartite graphs do not have cycles of odd length. Therefore, the structural equilibrium cannot be measured as formalized before. But it can be extended to calculate the ratio of
balanced cycles of length four. For this purpose, we define the
multiplicative transitivity for bipartite graphs as follows.
A signed bipartite graph exhibits multiplicative transitivity
when a path of three edges tend to be completed by a fourth
edge having a sign equal to the product of the three edges’
signs.
This can be rephrased as the enemy of my enemy of my
enemy is my enemy, or the enemy of my friend of my enemy is
my friend, etc. Figure 4 depicts two cycles with odd number of
edges (a and c), and two cycles with even number of edges (b
and d). By definition, the cycles with odd number of negative
edges do not satisfy multiplicative transitivity.
Hence, the corresponding relative signed clustering coefficient can be reformulated for bipartite graphs as follows:


A ◦ AAT A
+
SE(A) = 
Ā ◦ ĀĀT Ā

1/2

S TRUCTURAL E QUILIBRIUM

The relation phrased as the enemy of my enemy is my friend
is observed on various networks. This relation in general can
be formalized for graphs by constraining any cycle of arbitrary
length to have even number of negative edges [26]. In [11],
authors relate this constraint with the multiplicative transitivity
property of an adjacency matrix, which can be measured using
a modification of the clustering coefficient introduced in [17].
The structural equilibrium(SE) can be measured by checking the consistency of the edges forming cycles of length three.
The relative signed clustering coefficient calculates the ratio of
balanced cycles among all possible cycles of length three.

E XPERIMENTS & E VALUATIONS

To validate our algorithm, we have used two different
datasets that are US Congress and political blogosphere. In
addition to real data, we introduced a model to generate
synthetic data to analyze the performance of the algorithms
for various parameters.
A. US Congress
The US Congress has been collecting data since the very
first congress of the US history. This data has been encoded
as XML files and publicly shared through the govtrack.us
project2 .
From various types of data available at the project site, we
collected the roll call votes for the 111th US Congress which
includes The Senate and The House of Representatives and
covers the years 2009-2010.

According to The Library of Congress3 ,
111th US Senate

A roll call vote guarantees that every Member’s vote
is recorded, but only a minority of bills receive a roll
call vote.
The 111th Senate has 1084 senators and the data contains
their votes on 696 bills, and The 111th House has 451 representatives and the data contains their votes on 1655 bills.

111th US Congress

We extracted the adjacency matrix A ∈ {−1, 0, 1}|U |×|V | ,
with U vertices representing the congressmen, and the V
vertices representing the bills. The values aij are 1 if the congressman ui votes ‘Yea’ for the bill vj , -1 if the congressman
votes ‘Nay’, and 0 if he did not attend the session.
The aforementioned scaling algorithms will scale both the
congressmen and the bills. In presence of partisanship5 in the
Congress, the sign of the scale values for the congressmen
should correspond to the Democrat and Republican parties,
and the magnitude of the scale values should represent the
amount of partisanship. The first two columns of Table I
provide information about this data as well as the partitioning
accuracies of the algorithms.

Fig. 5.

We analyzed the congressmen that have been assigned to
be moderate by each algorithm. We observed that the baseline
algorithms tend to have the congressmen with less number of
votes (i.e. lesser degree) to be moderate regardless of their
partisanship. On the other hand, when we queried the names
assigned to be most moderates by the ANCO-HITS, for both
Democrats and Republicans, we were able to identify a number
of supporting articles matching the ANCO-HITS scaling [27],
[28], [29], [30].

Figure 5 depicts the vote matrices of the 111th US
Congress, with rows representing the congressmen and the
columns representing the bills. The light green color represents
’Yea’ votes, and dark red represents ’Nay’ votes. Scaling these
graphs leads to a re-ordering of the rows and columns where
congressmen and bills are co-clustered together.

111th US Congress

Figure 6 represents the bipartite graph of the 111th US
Congress data after scaling both the congressmen and the bills
with ANCO-HITS. The light green colored edges represent
’Yea’ votes, and dark red represents ’Nay’ votes. Similar to our
motivating Figure 1, this figure also shows partisan behavior
in the 111th US Congress.

4 Normally, each congress has 100 senators (2 from each state), however in
many of the congresses, there are unexpected changes on the seats caused by
displacements or deaths.
5 Partisanship can be defined as being devoted to or biased in support of a
party.

B. Political Blogosphere

C. Synthetic Data

As Web 2.0 platforms gained popularity, it became easy
for web users to be a part of the web and express their
opinions, mostly through blogs. Most blogs are maintained
by individuals, whereas there are also professional blogs with
a group of authors. In this study, we focus on a set of popular
political liberal or conservative blogs that have a clearly declared positions. These blogs contain discussions about social,
political, economic issues and related key individuals. They
express positive sentiment towards individuals whom they
share ideologies with, and negative sentiment towards others.
In these blogs, it is common to see criticism of people within
the same camp, or support for people from the other camp.

The actual partitioning information for the real datasets
were available, which made it possible to check the partitioning
accuracy of the algorithms. However, to thoroughly check the
scaling accuracy of the algorithms, we developed a method to
generate random bipartite graphs with the following properties:

In this experiment, we collected a list of 22 most popular
liberal and conservative blogs from the Technorati6 rankings.
For each blog, we fetched the posts for the period of 6 months
before the 2008 US presidential elections (May - October,
2008) due to the intensity of the debates and discussions. Table
II shows the list of blogs with their URLs, political camps and
the number of posts for the given period.

•

Following procedure describes the method to generate
random graphs.
RandomGraph(m, n, Ddegree , Dscale )
Let A, U , V , X and Y be defined as in Definition 1.

We use AlchemyAPI to run a named entity tagger to
extract people names from the posts, and entity-level sentiment
analysis which provided us with weighted sentiment (positive
values indicating support, and negative indicating opposition)
for each person. This information was used to synthesize a
signed bipartite graph, where the blogs and people correspond
to the two sets of vertices U and V . The aij values of the
adjacency matrix A are the cumulative sum of sentiment values
for each mention of the person vj by the blog ui .
To get a gold standard list of the most influential liberal and
conservative people, we used The Telegraph List8 for 2007.
The third column of Table I provides information about this
data as well as the partitioning accuracies of the algorithms.

The degrees and the scores for the vertices in U
and V follow independent probability distribution with
varying parameters and shapes.

5)

Create m vertices for U , and n vertices for V
Independently assign degrees 1 ≤ d(ui ) ≤ m and
1 ≤ d(vj ) ≤ n with probability distribution Ddegree
Independently assign −1 ≤ xi , yj ≤ +1 values with
probability distribution Dscale .
Generate an adjacency list of pairs (ui , vj ), where
each node ui and vj occur in the list d(ui ) and d(vj )
times respectively.
For each adjacency pair (ui , vj ), assign the entry in
the adjacency matrix aij with value
a) sgn(xi ) × sgn(yj ), with probability 1 − (1 −
|xi |)(1 − |yj |)
b) −sgn(xi ) × sgn(yj ), with probability (1 −
|xi |)(1 − |yj |)

The difference between the scale obtained for a vertex by
executing the scaling algorithm and its scale assigned by the
random graph generator algorithm defines the error for that
vertex. Table III shows the mean error vs vertex degrees plots
for each algorithm applied to 12 different synthetic data sets.
In our experiments, the number of vertices of the graph is
m = n = 100. We used four different distributions for varying
polarization. These were perfectly polarized, Beta, bimodal
and uniform distributions [31]. Perfectly polarized distribution
was obtained by mapping all vertices to the extremes of both

sides with equal probability. We used three different normal
distributions for varying the degree distributions of vertices.
Degree distributions were obtained by N (µ = 30, σ = 2),
N (µ = 30, σ = 5) and N (µ = 30, σ = 10) in order to
evaluate the effect of degree variance on the performance of
the algorithms. We also experimented with different µ values
of 10, 30, and 50 in order to measure the effect of density
variations of the graph on the performance of the algorithms,
which did not show any significant impact.
For each polarization and degree distribution we tested
the performance of two baseline algorithms and our proposed
algorithm. Table III presents these experimental results corresponding to 12 scenarios. In this table, columns correspond to
the variance in degrees, and rows correspond to the polarization
distributions.
In order to better visualize the effect of the degree of
the vertex in determining its scaling position we used the
mean error as an aggregate score. In the scatter plots, x-axis
corresponds to the degree of vertices of a graph, and y-axis
corresponds to mean scaling error. There are some error peaks
at the boundary degree values due to their low frequencies.

degree senator to a moderate location, even though he or she
can be extremely partisan. ANCO-HITS manages the degree
bias by a normalizing scheme, and places this senator to an
appropriate location.
In order to analyze longitudinal voting patterns for the US
Congresses, we downloaded all voting records since the 1st US
Congress, executed ANCO-HITS, and produced an interactive
visualization system as described in [32]. This system is
accessible online at www.PartisanScale.com
Our future work involves developing techniques for detecting and presenting both friendly and unfriendly neighborhoods
of a blog or an issue, and their agreements and disagreements.
We also plan to incorporate longitudinal analysis to detect
trends and trajectories over time.

From the table, we can make the following observations:
•

Across all polarizations, as the vertex degree variance
increases, overall errors for baseline algorithms increase due to their sensitivity to vertex degrees.

•

Between the baseline algorithms, spectral clustering
consistently outperforms CO-HITS.

•

Even though spectral clustering performs almost as
good as our proposed ANCO-HITS for bimodal and
uniform polarization distributions, when the polarization is high, as in the other two distributions, its
performance degrades.

•

As polarization increases, from U-shaped to perfect
polarization, ANCO-HITS performance also increases.
In case of perfect polarization, ANCO-HITS has almost no error.

Overall, in every single case our proposed ANCO-HITS
algorithm outperforms the baselines.

C ONCLUSIONS & F UTURE W ORK

In this paper, we introduced a new problem for scaling and
partitioning signed weighted bipartite graphs. We adapted two
existing algorithms, and proposed a new algorithm to solve this
problem. We used both real data from political blogosphere
and US Congress records, as well as synthetic data to evaluate
these algorithms. Our experiments showed that our proposed
algorithm is very effective and outperforms the two other
baselines. The algorithms in source code and the test data is
available online at www.PartisanScale.com/paperdata
In real world graphs, it is rarely the case that all the nodes
have the same degree. Some bloggers have more extensive
coverage than others. Similarly, some senators miss or abstain
on more votes than others. Partisanship shall not be affected
by the variance in node degrees. A marginal example is the
case when a senator supersedes a deceased one through the
end of the term. All the baseline algorithms assign this low
