and metaphors). Increasingly, governments and international
communities are concerned about the security implications
of climate change as empirical research has documented that
climate change is linked to increased risk of violent conﬂict
[4]. For example, in May 2015, U.S. President Barack Obama
suggested that extreme weather is a threat to national security
and elevates the risk of global instability and conﬂict. Some
popular press adopted security threat frame to gain public attention. Therefore, systematic detection of news frames related
to climate change offers better understanding of stakeholders
and their competing perspectives.
Politicians have used framing on hotly debated issues to
shift public opinion, gain support and pursue their agenda.
A frame is the bundling of a component of oratory to urge
certain perceptions and to dishearten others [5]. Framing is
accomplished when a choice of words, expressions, subjects
and other logical gadgets support one understanding of an
arrangement of realities, and debilitate other interpretations.
One of those framed issues is climate change. Internet created
a public space for politicians and stakeholders to frame climate
change and related issues to push for their agenda. Online
tools such as blogsphere, microblogging and social media
streams have increased the availability of data on climate
change related debate and made it feasible for researchers to
analyze them.
Framing research requires qualitative analysis of a number
of texts by subject matter experts to identify and code a set
of frames. This is a time consuming process that does not
scale well. In order to address the scalability problem, machine
learning techniques can be utilized to detect and classify
frames. In this paper we propose a system for automatic
detection of frames in sentences in a climate change related
corpus, and map them to one of four expert identiﬁed frame

Abstract— The subliminal impact of framing of social,
political and environmental issues such as climate change
has been studied for long time in political science and
communications research. Media framing offers “interpretative
package” for average citizens on how to make sense of climate
change and its consequences to their livelihoods, how to deal
with its negative impacts, and which mitigation or adaptation
policies to support. A line of related work has used bag of
words and word-level features to detect frames automatically
in text. Such works face limitations since standard keyword
based features may not generalize well to accommodate surface
variations in text when different keywords are used for similar
concepts. In this paper, we develop a new type of textual
features that generalize (subject,verb,object) triplets extracted
from text, by clustering them into high-level concepts. We utilize
these concepts as features to detect frames in text. Our corpus
comprises more than 45,000 climate change related sentences.
Expert coders annotated those sentences as frame/non-frame and
framed sentences were mapped into one of four general frame
categories: solution, problem threat, cause, and motivation.
Compared to unigram and bigram based models, classiﬁcation
using our generalized concepts yielded better discriminating
features and a higher accuracy classiﬁer with a 12% boost (i.e.
from 74% to 83% in f-measure) for frame/no frame detection.

I. I NTRODUCTION
Climate change has provoked heated debates on the global
political and media arenas. Media framing offers “interpretative package” for average citizens on how to make sense
of climate change and its consequences to their livelihoods,
how to deal with its negative impacts, and which mitigation
or adaptation policies to support [1], [2], [3]. News frames
encourage salient interpretation of debated issues through the
usage of rhetorical devices (e.g. words, repetitive phrases,

Example of merging two related concepts

[12].
Media representation of climate change plays a vital role
in shaping ongoing policy discourse, public perception and
attitudes. [14] suggests that prominent political actors frame
climate risk for their own purposes, and align frames with their
interests and perspectives through media feedback processes
of representing climate change risk. Studies have shown that
the lay people learn about climate change mainly through
consuming mainstream media news [15]. Consequently, [2]
argued news media framing can catalyze public engagement
and help trigger collective concern of climate change. Put
differently, media framing is a powerful tool to highlight
different aspects of the policy options, and promote speciﬁc
interpretations or evaluations that inﬂuence decision making
[16].
Existing typologies of climate change framing, focusing
on dichotomous categories, are limited by their inability to
link framing processes with movement interaction. We argue
that, in order to understand how the media reﬂect different
organizations interests in addressing climate change as a social
problem, it is necessary to supplement the social movement
focus on resource mobilization to framing processes of collective action problems. To do that, this study develops a nuanced
typology for studying climate change framing and its adequacy
for supporting a social movements that would be necessary to
overcome the collective action problem. Our typology provides
a holistic map to evaluate how climate change media framing
can enable appropriate social and policy actions that ultimately
can mitigate risks of social unrest. We apply this framework to
examine framing of climate change in media and social media
texts collected from the Niger Basin region over seven months
from August 2014 to February 2015, using a novel coding
technique to assess diagnostic, prognostic, and motivational
framing described by [17] as the keys to effective social
movements.

categories: solution, problem threat, cause, and motivation.
Our problem here can be described as a multi-level multi-class
classiﬁcation problem where we ﬁrst classify each sentence as
Frame or Non-Frame. Then, the Frame sentences are further
classiﬁed into one of four predeﬁned frame categories. In
particular, we show that generalized concepts and relations [6]
as features outperform classical textual features (e.g. uni-grams
and bi-grams) while detecting and categorizing Frame/NonFrame sentences. We experimented with SVM [7], Random
Forests [8] and sparse logistic regression [9] classiﬁers, and
identiﬁed sparse logistic regression as the best performing
classiﬁer for these tasks.
Generalized concepts approach extracts high-level information from text as relationships and concepts forming a
semantic network. It ﬁrst uses shallow semantic parser to generate POS tags to obtain semantic triplets (subject,verb,object)
from text. Next, it utilizes a bottom-up agglomerative clustering approach to merge and generalize those triplets into
concepts. In NLP, shallow parsing is the task of extracting the subjects, predicates or verb phrases, and objects.
Figure 1 shows how two related triplets could be merged
into a higher level generalized concept. In this ﬁgure, two
extracted triplets: action plan→build→sustainability and
policy →consolidate→sustainability are merged to form a
high level generalized concept and relationship as: {action
plan, policy}→{build, consolidate}→{sustainability} by discovering contextual synonyms such as {action plan, policy}
and {build, consolidate}. Here the deﬁnition of contextual
synonyms is not based on the one in the traditional dictionary.
Rather, they correspond to phrases that may occur in similar
semantic roles and associated with similar contexts. In Figure
1 the two triplets share the same object {sustainability} and
semantically similar verbs; hence, we can merge their subjects
{action plan,policy} as contextual synonyms.

A. Media Framing

[18] examined twitter stream on extracted frames and
pointed out a strong ties between frames collected from news
with the public opinions expressed in tweeter feeds. [19] went
further to distill agenda from news and link them to action.
Content analysis of frames in news is performed either by (1)
manual frame coding, that is done by trained coders, which is
costly as well as not scalable, or by (2) frame identiﬁcation
by using machine learning techniques that overcome human

Mainstream media serve as the main arena where international governments, social and political actors, scientists,
social movement organizations interact and make competing
claims about climate change issues [10]. Communication
surrounding climate change can inhibit or support science
and policy interactions, propagate consensus or disagreements
[11], and ultimately facilitate social change [12], [13], depending on how messages about climate change have been framed

multi-class classiﬁcation problem for a given sentence.
IV. M ETHODOLOGY
A. Overall System Model
The overall system consists of documents collected from
nearly 100 RSS feeds that are related to climate change in
the Niger Delta region. We also perform sentence splitting of
documents, identiﬁcation of key frames and their categories
by the coders, feature extraction (uni-grams, bi-grams, and
generalized concepts), identiﬁcation of discriminative features,
and a predictive model to detect and identify the frame
categories for sentences containing frame references.
B. Climate Change Corpus
Fig. 2.

Our climate change corpus is comprised of nearly 45, 054
sentences extracted from news and social media websites, that
are related to climate change topics in Niger Basin region
over a seven months period from August 2014 to February
2015. There are 16, 050 sentences coded as frame sentences
and 29, 004 as non-frame sentences by domain experts. Frame
sentences are further categorized into one of four categories:
Solution, Problem Threat, Cause, and Motivation.

Multi-level multi-class classiﬁcation

limitations by automatically detecting frames after training a
classiﬁer [20]. Many studies have addressed media framing
as a document classiﬁcation problem by building a learning
model to classify documents or paragraphs by utilizing different features. Aside from document level, [21], [22] examined
the classiﬁcation task at the sentence level and even at the
phrase level. Previous work on sentence level classiﬁcation
has focused on experimenting with different classiﬁers and
different features. [23] examined: bag of words, n-grams,
and topic models to classify news articles and map them to
a set of frames. Others, [24] employed POS-tags [25] and
named entities [26] as features to detect and classify frames.
Ceran et al [27] experimented with {subject,verb,object} based
features and benchmarked “ paragraph level” classiﬁer for
story detection against standard keyword based features, which
showed signiﬁcant improvement in classiﬁcation accuracy.
More advanced conceptual features engineering was developed
in [6] as they showed how generalized concepts performed
better in detecting stories in paragraphs. We utilize their generalized concepts as features to detect and categorize frames.
Our paper works on sentence level classiﬁcation compared to
their paragraph level. Also, our task is a multi-level multiclass classiﬁcation task where we ﬁrst examine if a sentence
contains a frame, and then we identify which one of four
frame categories it belongs to. Moreover, we developed tripleextraction techniques where we can extract more features
and incorporate a larger percentage of sentences into the
classiﬁcation model (i.e. 80% of sentences compared to 40%).

C. N-gram Features
We experimented with both uni-gram and bi-gram features.
We run a simple term frequency - inverse document frequency
(TF-IDF) [28] based technique on the entire corpus to generate
a large ranked list of, stopword eliminated, uni-grams and bigrams, and we experimented with them separately as features
in our classiﬁcation models.
D. Generalized Concepts Features
In [6], they extracted concepts from paragraphs where only
40% of the paragraphs generated concepts. In this paper, since
we are working on sentence level, we improved the concept
extraction approach, by extracting more triplets by utilizing
a larger number of triplet extractors and pre-processing their
output to include about 80% of the sentences in our experimental evaluations.
1) Triplets
Extraction:
In
order
to
extract
Subject,Verb,Object triplets, ﬁrst we run a pronoun resolver
[29], [30], [31], [32]. Since triplets extraction is an ongoing
research topic in NLP, we proceeded to use four state-ofthe-art triplets extraction tools: ClearNLP [33], Reverb [34],
Everest [35], AlchemyAPI [36] as complementary systems.
Additionally, any triplet slots with phrases were segmented
into keywords, stemmed, stop-word removed and their
cartesian product were produced as additional triplets.
2) Concepts Generation: Triplets extraction algorithms typically produce noisy and sparse triplets. Therefore, we apply
a hierarchical bottom-up clustering algorithm that generalizes
triplets into more meaningful relationships. To do so, we
employ both syntactic and semantic criteria that are based
on the corpus to generalize triplets into high level concepts

Given a set of documents {D1 ,...,DM } where each document contains one or more paragraphs. First, we split documents into sentences {S1 ,...,SN }. Next, using sentences as
data points, we aim to resolve whether a sentence Si contains
a frame or not. And, if the sentence contains a frame, then
we aim to identify its category, as one of: {Solution, Problem

without drift. In syntactic criteria, a pair of subjects-verbsobjects are merged only if they share common context related
to their different arguments (i.e. a pair of different subjects
are merged only if they co-occur with an identical verb-object
context).
Additionally, we capture contextual synonyms for subjects,
verbs and objects by deﬁning a semantic criterion which is
based on our corpus as well as WordNet [37]. Corpus-based
contextual synonyms for subjects, verbs and objects is based
on their common verb-object, subject-object and subject-verb
contexts respectively. Also, we capture contextual synonyms
that are not derivable from our corpus by applying WordNet
synonyms and hyponyms on the memebers of the concepts to
further expand and generalize them.
In order for the information to propagate between clusters of
subjects/objects and clusters of relations, we apply a hierarchical bottom-up clustering algorithm [38]. High level concepts
and relations are merged to form clusters. Each cluster is represented by graph of nodes and edges where nodes represent
concepts and edges represent relations between concepts. The
details of the above criteria and the generalization algorithm
are available in [6].

and non-smooth optimization problem. The features with nonzero values on the sparse x vector yield the discriminant
factors for classifying a sentence.
V. E XPERIMENTAL E VALUATION
A. Sentence Annotation
Our experts developed four categories of climate change
related frames as follows:
• Solution framing (prognostic): Covering the prognostic
function of deﬁning what should be done about problems,
solution framing refers to actions taken to prevent further
impact of climate change effects or further impact of
the causes of climate change such as greenhouse gas
emissions. Solutions can also emphasize ongoing measures to deal with existing effects of climate change.
Six frames capture an array of mitigation and adaptation
efforts conservation, education, investment, infrastructure
and development, creation or implementation of policy
and programs, and goal.
• Problem Threat framing (diagnostic): This diagnostic
framing class stresses on how climate change or outcomes
of climate change impact various actors, industries, human health, and the environment, Eight codes capture
negative consequences and threats brought by climate
change, including environmental systems and ecosystem,
public health, economic development, food security, water scarcity, national security, social unrest, and general or
multiple impacts. Both cause framing and problem/threat
framing comprise the diagnostic function in deﬁning
social problems.
• Cause framing: This group of diagnostic frames focus on
attributing the blame for causing climate change to either
human activity, natural variation or other reasons. Six
subcategories captured different explanations for causal
attribution of climate change: (a) human activity, (b)
natural variation, (c) scientiﬁc uncertainty, (d) policy
causes, (e) insufﬁcient actions, and (f) human disruption
to mitigate climate change impact.
• Motivation framing (motivational): Motivational framing refers to statements that explicit call for deﬁnitive
course(s) of action and explain why the audience should
make an effort to enact solutions [17]. In other words,
motivational frames elaborate on the rationale for action
that goes beyond diagnosis and prognosis, and include
vocabularies of severity, urgency, efﬁcacy, and propriety
[40]. We added a general category to analyze statements
that call for actions without providing readers with abovementioned reasons.
We assigned sentence annotation to three different expert
coders where we break ties by using the majority vote.

E. Frame Classiﬁcation
To classify each sentence as Frame/Non-Frame and identify
its relevant frame category we utilize sparse learning framework [9], with the underlined motivation to select a subset
of discriminating concepts that can (1) identify sentences
containing frame references and (b) classify a sentence into
a frame category. The following steps describe our algorithm:
1) Generate features from the entire corpus
2) Filter the features × sentences matrix to include only
resultant generalized concepts/features
3) Formulate the problem in a general sparse learning
framework [9]. In particular, the logistical regression
formulation presented below ﬁts this application, since it
is a dichotomous frame classiﬁcation problem (e.g. each
sentence classiﬁed as Frame/Non-Frame), and multiclass classiﬁcation problem (e.g. each Frame sentence
is further classiﬁed as one of four frame {Solution,
Problem Threat, Cause, and Motivation}):

classiﬁer SLEP [39] to identify weighted discriminative features and classify sentences. We experimented with three
different classiﬁers (SVM [7], Random Forests [8]) and found
that SLEP outperformed both these other classiﬁers. Using
different types of features generated from the entire corpus, we
perform ten-fold cross-validation for measuring the classiﬁer’s
predictive accuracy to detect Frame/Non-Frame sentences.
Next, using features generated from frame sentences only, we
train a multi-class model to classify sentences into their corresponding frame category. We report precision, recall, and Fmeasure as quantitative evaluation metrics. Qualitative analysis
of the identiﬁed discriminating concepts is also presented in
the next section.
Table 1 presents the accuracies for detecting Frame/NonFrame sentences using different features. Using generalized
concepts approach as features, the resultant average accuracy
(F-measure of 83%) outperforms both accuracies with unigrams (74%) and bi-grams (68%) features by 12% and 22%
respectively.
Table 2 shows the accuracies for identifying the corresponding frame category. Using generalized concepts, these
accuracies vary between 73% and 83% (F-measure) for different categories. In this table, utilizing generalized concepts
yields slightly better performance compared to both uni-grams
and bi-grams with an overall average accuracy (F-measure) of
79%.

Uni-grams

associated global warming with carbon dioxide emissions
using the following triplets to construct a cohesive story:
• Scientiﬁc research indicate that atmospheric carbon dioxide increase at a large level.
• Cars and trucks were major sources of air pollution and
carbon dioxide emissions, which directly increased local
temperature.
2) Problem Threat Framing: Next, we turned our attention
to identify the dominant concepts representing the problem
and threat framing of climate change. Media texts tended
to highlight devastating environmental impacts caused by
climate change, such as ﬂoods, prolonged drought, loss of
landmass and soil, desertiﬁcation, sea-level rise, storm surge,
heat waves, and more. Flooding, in particular, is a severe
concern as nine out of sixteen triplets of high weigh values
explicitly mentioned the negative impacts of heavy rainfall
or torrential rain. Consequently, economic condition and food
insecurity were inﬂuenced, infrastructure was damaged, and
health diseases were exacerbated with the increased intensity
and frequency of ﬂoods.
3) Solution Framing: The most representative discourse of
solution framing is discussed next in Section D.
4) Motivation Framing: When discussing motivation for
why policy actors and citizens should act upon, the most
salient concepts emphasized that international communities
(e.g. U.S., EU, and China) should negotiate a legal agreement
to reduce greenhouse gas emissions at the end of 2015.
There is little attention to stating speciﬁc reasons for offering localized adaptation strategies that people can undertake.
Although the awareness of climate change impacts among
African government ofﬁcials was generally high, the prevailing
generalized concept of calling for international actions on
mitigation from mainstream media discourse reﬂected a lack

C. Qualitative Analysis of Resultant Concepts
Table III shows top ﬁve discreminative concepts for each
frame category. Our team of experts explored the highly
signiﬁcant generalized concepts germane to four-class framing
in media discourse surrounding climate change across West
African RSS feeds and provided qualitative evaluations as
follows:
1) Cause Framing: Causal responsibility of climate change
and its effects was often attributed to anthropogenic activities, particularly man-made greenhouse gas emissions, humaninduced pollution, and fossil fuel use. Carbon dioxide and
greenhouse gas emission emerged as highly signiﬁcant concepts, as indicated by high weigh value. Media texts often

actions) can enhance local community resilience. According to
the IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) report,
majority of rural communities rely on rain-fed agriculture
to sustain their livelihoods in West Africa, the region worst
affected by climate change. With changing rainfall patterns,
prolonged droughts and ﬂooding, sustainable system of developing agriculture-smart technologies can help improve food
security at the household level. Interestingly, the African media
discussed that California Governor Jerry Brown has signed the
most signiﬁcant framework for regulating underground water
resources to achieve sustainable development in September,
2014.

D. Visualizing Concepts
To visualize the generalized concept and relation clusters,
we utilize a semantic network [41] of nodes (V) and edges
(E) to describe the semantic space of the underlying texts.
Circle nodes represent subjects/objects and square nodes represent verbs. Edges represent relations between concepts. In
such a network, distinct combinations of actors (subjects)
perform or recommend various sets of actions (verbs) on
distinct combinations of targets (objects). The sample semantic
network in Figure 3 (next page) illustrates how sustainability
emerges as a concept that is central to addressing climate
change impacts. The semantic network represents the contextual relationships between generalized triplets relating to
strategies for sustainable adaptation. In the media discourse,
sustainable adaptation is predominantly framed as an effective
solution to reduce impacts of climate change and contribute to
social, economic, and environmental development. As shown
in Figure 3, developing sustainable national programs (or

Climate change framing has pervasive inﬂuence, and this paper presents a new computational approach based on generalized concepts to identify popular media frames and map them

may not generalize well to accommodate surface variations in
text when different keywords are used for similar concepts. In
this paper, we developed a new type of textual features that
generalize (subject,verb,object) triplets extracted from text,
by clustering them into high-level concepts. Compared to
unigram and bigram based models, frame classiﬁcation using
our generalized concepts yielded better discriminating features
with a 12% boost in accuracy (i.e. from 74% to 83% in fmeasure) for frame/no frame detection. In our future work, we
plan to utilize discriminating generalized concepts indicating
actor-action-target sequences to infer causal chains of events,
frames, and actions that might lead to better indicators of
climate-change related social unrest.
