Utilization of movement data from mobile sports tracking applications is affected by its inherent biases and sensitivity, which need to be understood when developing value-added services for, e.g., application users and city
planners. We have developed a method for generating a privacy-preserving heat map with user diversity
(ppDIV), in which the density of trajectories, as well as the diversity of users, is taken into account, thus
preventing the bias effects caused by participation inequality. The method is applied to public cycling workouts
and compared with privacy-preserving kernel density estimation (ppKDE) focusing only on the density of the recorded trajectories and privacy-preserving user count calculation (ppUCC), which is similar to the quadrat-count
of individual application users. An awareness of privacy was introduced to all methods as a data pre-processing
step following the principle of k-Anonymity. Calibration results for our heat maps using bicycle counting data
gathered by the city of Helsinki are good (R2 N 0.7) and raise high expectations for utilizing heat maps in a city
planning context. This is further supported by the diurnal distribution of the workouts indicating that, in addition
to sports-oriented cyclists, many utilitarian cyclists are tracking their commutes. However, sports tracking data
can only enrich ofﬁcial in-situ counts with its high spatio-temporal resolution and coverage, not replace them.

1. Introduction
Mobile sports tracking applications have become popular among the
public audience, and a large number of smartphone users are willing to
collect and compare their workouts privately, as well as to share their
data within social networks or even publicly, for all application and Internet users. Key factors in this development have been the maturity of sensor
technology, such as an accelerometer, digital compass, gyroscope, and GPS
(e.g., Lane et al., 2010), available in nearly all recent mid- and top-range
smartphones; and well-documented application programming interfaces
for third-party developers to create new applications for mobile platforms.
The aim of our work is to develop methods to enrich workout data
from a mobile sports tracking application to create privacy-preserving
information about the most popular places to do sports. While our
case study focuses on public cycling workouts collected using Sports
Tracker (http://www.sports-tracker.com/), the developed methods can
be used for any other sports recorded using any mobile sports tracking
application. The approach chosen for this study relies on visual data
mining, which utilizes human perception in data exploration, and combines human ﬂexibility, creativity, and knowledge with a computer's
storage capacity, computing power, and visualization capabilities

(Keim, 2002). When integrated into a location-based service (LBS),
the result of our analysis replies to the end-user's question “Where
have most cyclists continued to from here?” In addition, we investigate
the relation of tracking data and in-situ bicycle counting information
in order to compare the quality of the derived heat maps, as well as to
calibrate the heat maps based on mobile sports tracking application
data, for example, for city planning purposes. We use the term “workout” throughout the paper to denote all recorded trajectories, be they
recreational/exercise or utilitarian by purpose.
The idea of generating heat maps from mobile sports app data to
communicate the popularity of sports is not new (e.g., Garmin, 2013;
Lin, 2012; Strava, 2014), but less attention has been paid to the methods
for making the calculation, and concerns about the appropriate understanding of the heat maps have been raised due to new application
areas of heat maps, such as city planning (Maus, 2014a) and analysis
of eye-tracking data (Bojko, 2009). When creating heat maps, an obvious surrogate for the popularity of sports is the density of workout trajectories, but other surrogates, such as the number of different people
doing sports, can also be used. According to the limited information
available on existing heat maps, the one provided by Strava uses the
number of GPS points as a pixel value (Mach, 2014), whereas in the
heat map offered by Nike+, the value at each pixel represents the number of users (Lin, 2012). As we will show in this paper, the two methods
can locally result in very different patterns of bike riding.

The use of heat maps as a representation of the intensity of a phenomenon has its roots in spectrometry (e.g., Moon et al., 2009) and
the generation of isarithm and dot density maps (Slocum et al., 2009),
but in the context of cartography, a textbook deﬁnition of a heat map
is still missing (e.g., Trame and Keßler, 2011). Heat maps are a common
visualization technique in many ﬁelds of research where large amounts
of data are handled. For example, in human–computer interaction,
“attention heat maps” are a popular tool of visual analysis of eyetracking data (e.g., Blascheck et al., 2014; Bojko, 2009). Related to studies utilizing the increasing volumes of volunteered geographic information (VGI; Goodchild, 2007), heat maps have been used, for example, to
reveal attractive/popular places in a region using the density-based spatial clustering of geotagged images (Kisilevich et al., 2010; Kurata, 2012)
and videos (Mirković et al., 2010), or to visualize spatio-temporal patterns revealed by the distribution of tweets (e.g., Morstatter et al.,
2013; Zeile et al., 2012). The coloring of a heat map is typically selected
in such way that the interpretation of the intensity differences becomes
intuitive. This is expected to happen when warm colors, in terms of
color temperature, are used for high intensities of the represented phenomenon and cool colors for low intensities (e.g., Špakov and Miniotas,
2007).
In addition to the public audience, interest in mobile tracking applications, and enriching, especially, cycling data collected with them has
emerged among city planners (Albergotti, 2014; Charlton et al., 2011;
Hood et al., 2011). One of the biggest challenges in a city-planning context regarding non-motorized trafﬁc is the lack of documentation on the
usage and the demand ﬁgures for, for example, cyclists and pedestrians
(Lindsey et al., 2014; NBPD, 2014). Traditional approaches for monitoring cycling trafﬁc have been the use of surveys for qualitative results and
different types of manual and automatic in-situ counting for quantitative results (Grifﬁn et al., 2014; NBPD, 2014; Rantala and Luukkonen,
2014). Mobile tracking of cyclists has been seen as an attractive, inexpensive, and dynamic alternative to traditional bicycle data collection
(Hudson et al., 2012). An early approach to tracking was the development of dedicated platforms, such as CycleTracks, which was developed
at San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency and has since been
used at a number of agencies and municipalities in the US (Charlton
et al., 2011; Masoner, 2014). In the UK, another crowdsourcing-based
application, Cycle Hackney, is expected to provide a cost-effective way
to ﬁnd out where, especially, utilitarian cycling is taking place
(CycleStreets, 2014). Recently, in the city of Oulu, Finland, there has
been a development project aiming to create a “smoothness navigator”
for cyclists, based on 1000 recorded tracks of people participating in the
pilot phase (Poikola, 2014). The problem in dedicated tracking
platforms appears to be the limited group of people interested in
using them voluntarily (SFMTA, 2013). To overcome this problem the
potential of utilizing mobile sports tracking data has been recognized,
reﬂecting the idea of utilizing humans as sensors (Goodchild, 2007)
and big data analytics (e.g., Russom, 2011). For example, Oregon's
Department of Transportation paid $20,000 to use data from the mobile
sports tracking application Strava for a year, containing 400,000 individual bicycle trips, totaling 8 million bicycle kilometers traveled (Estes,
2014; Maus, 2014b).
While mobile sports tracking data may not qualify as ‘big data’
regarding its volume – except in the sense “bigger than previously”
(Goodchild, 2013) – it shares many characteristics with other social
media data, often classiﬁed as big data. Many of the characteristics follow from the fact that big data is typically not collected with any speciﬁc
purpose in mind or not used for its original purpose (Kitchin, 2014). In
statistics, random sampling is used to guarantee the representativeness
of observations, but in big data analytics, the ‘sample’ is not randomly
chosen at all (Goodchild, 2013). Rather, the aim is to use all the data following the principle of exhaustivity in scope (Harford, 2014; Kitchin,
2014). However, considering that only a small and possibly behaviorally
biased subset of cyclists use mobile applications to track their routes, the
question is how well they represent the whole population of cyclists

(e.g., Maus, 2014a; Rantala and Luukkonen, 2014); i.e., as social media
data in general, sports tracking data is affected by self-selection bias
(Shearmur, 2015). In addition, mobile tracking applications have their
differences with respect to appearance and function, such as the available range of sports (multi-sports or single activity type), and may
therefore attract different people. As an example, the cycling and running app Strava has the reputation of being used by more competitive
or “serious” cyclists (Zahradnik, 2014) and is also targeting people
who identify themselves as “athletes” (Strava, 2014). On the other
hand, for example, Sports Tracker (ST, 2014) “want[s] to help people
train better, connect through sports, and live healthier, happier lives;”
HeiaHeia! focuses on the business-to-business sector and work welfare
(Kauppalehti, 2013); and Endomondo (2014) is, in its own words,
aiming “to motivate people to get and stay active.” It has been estimated
that 90% of the cyclists who use Strava are male (Usborne, 2013;
Vanderbilt, 2013) and in 2012, 75% of all Endomondo users were men
(Endoangela, 2012). Furthermore, participation inequality is a known
property of VGI and online communities, according to which 90% of
community members are followers and do not contribute to the community, whereas 9% contribute from time to time, and 1% account for
most contributions (Nielsen, 2006). Although sports tracking applications do not today represent shared projects where people would
track and share their workouts to promote the common good, some
typical motivations for contribution in VGI, such as social reward and
enhanced personal reputation (Coleman et al., 2009), can be identiﬁed
within their communities as well. These bias issues introduce a major
challenge in using mobile sports app data in a city-planning context.
According to Westin's tenet, privacy is an individual's right to have
full control over information about themselves, and to decide when,
how, and to what extent this information is shared with others
(Agrawal et al., 2002). Guaranteeing privacy in LBSs is extremely important, due to the unique characteristics of moving object data (Fung et al.,
2010; Montjoye et al., 2013; Verykios et al., 2008). Topics such as
anonymization of the original dataset (e.g., Monreale et al., 2010;
Pensa et al., 2008), or de-identifying a given LBS-request location (e.g.,
Bettini et al., 2005; Gedik and Liu, 2004; Gruteser and Liu, 2004), have
gained a great deal of attention in trajectory studies but are beyond
the scope of this paper. Instead, we approach privacy-preservation
from the standpoint of visualization.
The idea behind preserving privacy in visualizations is to generalize
or otherwise obfuscate data in such a manner that the disclosed data is
still useful in the particular case (Andrienko et al., 2008; Fung et al.,
2010). Various methods of geographical masking, ﬁrst introduced by
Armstrong et al. (1999), have been developed with the aim of
protecting the conﬁdentiality of individual locations by adding stochastic or deterministic noise to the geographic coordinates of the original
data points without substantially affecting analytical results or the visual characteristics of the original pattern (Kwan et al., 2004). Spatial aggregation of individual-level data for administrative areas or other
areal units that have a population greater than a chosen cutoff value is
a common procedure of preserving conﬁdentiality, for example, in
censuses where disclosure control has long been an integral part of
the process (Armstrong et al., 1999; Kwan et al., 2004; Leitner and
Curtis, 2006; Young et al., 2009). Because aggregation can hide important spatial patterns in the data, various alternative geo-masking techniques, such as random perturbation and afﬁne transformation
(translate, rotate, and scale), have been introduced to preserve the disaggregated, discrete nature of the original data (Armstrong et al., 1999;
Kwan et al., 2004). Although they have been used mainly with georeferenced, sensitive health- and crime-related point data (e.g., Leitner
and Curtis, 2006; Kounadi and Leitner, 2015), Krumm (2007) and
Seidl et al. (2015) have applied them also to GPS trajectory data. In
this study, where it was crucial to prevent re-identiﬁcation of an individual user and trajectory while providing the heat map viewer accurate
information about popular cycling paths in their actual locations on the
road network, geo-masking techniques as such were, however, not

J. Oksanen et al. / Journal of Transport Geography 48 (2015) 135–144

adequate. Instead, we followed the principle of k-Anonymity in
anonymization of the ﬁnal heat maps. K-Anonymity was originally
developed for record data by Samarati and Sweeney (1998), but has
since been extended to spatio-temporal movement data by, for example, Abul et al. (2008), and Terrovitis and Mamoulis (2008). Related to
visualization techniques, the method has been previously applied to privacy preservation for parallel coordinates (Dasgupta and Kosara, 2011).
K-Anonymity refers to the requirement according to which “each release of data must be such that every combination of values of quasiidentiﬁers can be indistinctly matched to at least k individuals”
(Samarati and Sweeney, 1998). By quasi-identiﬁers, they mean a set of
attributes whose publication needs to be somehow restricted. When
bringing the k-Anonymity requirement into the heat map context, our
goal was that all details interpretable from the ﬁnal heat map must be
such that the result has been borne out from at least a minimum
pre-deﬁned number of application users.
This paper presents a novel method for deriving privacy-preserving
heat maps from mobile sports application data which takes into account
the density of trajectories, as well as the diversity of users, attempting to
avoid the bias caused by having few very active sports application users.
As a secondary objective, the study presents a method by which heat
maps derived from a mobile sports application's cycling data can be calibrated using in-situ ﬁeld-collected bicycle counting data. With this approach, cities may use the calibrated heat maps as source information
for city planning purposes. The remainder of the paper is organized as
follows. In Section 2, we describe the data and methods used for deriving privacy-preserving heat maps. In Section 3, we compare the heat
maps and discuss the characteristics of different methods, and we also
show the relation between our heat maps and real-world in-situ bicycle
counting data. Finally, in Section 4, conclusions are drawn and some
future directions are pointed out.
2. Materials and methods
The data used for our study was obtained from Sports Tracking Technologies Ltd., the inventor of the ﬁrst mobile sports tracking application,
Sports Tracker, for mobile phones (ST, 2014). While the app turns a
smart phone into a sports computer, it is also a complete social platform
on which application users share their workouts, photos, and experiences of exercises, with their group of friends or even with everyone.
The basic unit of recorded data is a workout, which contains information
about the user, sport (28 pre-classiﬁed sports, such as cycling, walking,
and running), and a 4D (x, y, z, and t) coordinate list recorded at approximately 1-second intervals from the start to the ﬁnish of the workout.
For this study, the data contained only public workouts from the region
of Helsinki, and each user identiﬁer was changed into a pseudo-ID at
Sports Tracking Technologies Ltd. before the data delivery.
The total sample data contained 192,597 workouts, of which a
subset of 36,757 workouts collected by 2424 users represented cycling
inside our approximately 320 km2 study region. Temporally continuous
data was recorded between April 17th 2010 and November 21st 2012,
and it consisted of a total of 36,663,190 GPS points. About 82% of
the data contained valid time values accepted for further analysis. In
a pre-processing phase, the data was systematically thinned to
10-second time intervals, the time data was transformed from POSIX
time to Coordinated Universal Time (UTC + 02:00), and coordinates
were converted from WGS84 (EPSG:4326) to ETRS-TM35FIN
(EPSG:3067) (Anon, 2012). In addition, each point was supplied with
information about distance, time, and speed from the previous tracked
point. Further ﬁltering of gross errors was done based on thresholds
set for distance (b 300 m) and speed (b 50 m/s) between consecutive
GPS observations.
One characteristic of the data was that the number of people tracking and publishing a large number of workouts was small, and most of
the users had tracked less than 10 workouts (Fig. 1), which appears to
follow the principle of participation inequality (Nielsen, 2006). In the

study area and within the time range, 65% of the users had published
5 or fewer workouts, and 87% had published 20 or fewer workouts.
While the most active user had published more than 600 workouts,
only 3% of the users had published more than 100 workouts. On
average, for the sample data, each user had published 15 workouts.
Further inspection of the data revealed cyclicity at a number of temporal scales. At an annual level, the popularity of cycling increased
sharply during the summer season and peaked in August (Fig. 2a and
b). In addition, the popularity of tracking cycling increased steadily
from 2010 to 2012. When focusing on the weekly pattern, tracking of
cycling was at its highest level on Tuesdays and Wednesdays, while
the minimum level was reached on Fridays (Fig. 2c). Peaks in the frequencies of tracked points between 7–8 AM and 4–5 PM (Fig. 2d) reveal
that many people use Sports Tracker to track their daily commuting
trips.
The use of pseudoIDs is not an adequate means for preserving the
privacy of the application users since location alone may also reveal sensitive personal data (e.g., Bettini et al., 2005; Samarati and Sweeney,
1998). Privacy ﬁltering of the tracked points was done in a preprocessing phase containing: 1) the generation of trajectories from all
points, 2) the generation of a user count raster (number of different
users on a 10 m grid within a 15 m search radius) from the trajectories,
3) the extraction of user count values at all points, and 4) the generation
of trajectories from the subset of points with a user count value higher
than a pre-deﬁned threshold (here 5 users). By this method, we were
able to ﬁlter privacy-preserving trajectories, which contained only the
features that were covered by an adequate number of different users.
From the ﬁltered cycling trajectories we generated heat maps by a
custom ArcGIS tool using three methods, namely privacy-preserving
user count calculation (ppUCC), privacy-preserving kernel density estimation (ppKDE), and privacy-preserving kernel density estimation
modiﬁed with the user diversity index (ppDIV). ppUCC was the simplest
of the applied methods, in which the study region was partitioned into
sub-regions of equal area and each area got its value, so-called quadrat
counts (Bailey and Gatrell, 1995), from the number of users passing the
pixel or a larger calculation window (20 m in our case). Thus, using
ppUCC, we created a 2D histogram of individual cyclists within the
study area.
Kernel density estimation (KDE) is a family of methods originally developed to obtain smooth estimates of uni- or multivariate densities
from observations (Bailey and Gatrell, 1995), but recently KDE has
also been widely used to derive heat maps from data representing
moving objects (e.g., Krisp and Peters, 2011; Willems, 2011). The
commonly used kernel function is described by Silverman (1986):
ppKDEðsÞ ¼

n
s−s 
1 X
i
;
K
nh i¼1
h

where h is the width of the calculation window (bandwidth), n is the
number of sample points, and K is the kernel function used for smoothing the estimate. Here, a quartic approximation of a Gaussian kernel
(Silverman, 1986) was used. Sample points within the radius h are

represented by si. When KDE is used for line features, such as
trajectories, the result of KDE can be thought of as the result of placing
a smooth kernel surface on top of the lines. The bandwidth was chosen
as 25 m, to generalize the positioning uncertainty of GPS devices, but

simultaneously to preserve the details of the street network along
which the cycling has occurred.
In ppDIV the result of ppKDE was scaled with the diversity of users at
each quadrat. Diversity is a descriptive statistic of a population with a

center. The map contains data from the Topographic database by the National Land Survey of Finland, 7/2012.

J. Oksanen et al. / Journal of Transport Geography 48 (2015) 135–144

class structure (Junge, 1994). Diversity indices are used when we are interested in quantifying how many different classes there are in our data,
and simultaneously how evenly the entities are distributed among
those classes. The index used in this study is Simpson's Diversity Index
D (McDonald and Dimmick, 2003):

pðsÞ2i

ppDIVðsÞ ¼ ppKDEðsÞ  DðsÞ
where pi is the proportion of user i's trajectories among all trajectories

in the quadrat s. This resulted in an index that was close to 1 when
the user distribution was locally uniform, and close to 0 when skewness
of the user distribution was locally high.
Finally, the heat maps were compared with each other, as well as
with the ofﬁcial 2013 bicycle counting data gathered by the city of
Helsinki (Hellman, 2013). The challenge in a quantitative comparison
of densities represented as heat maps based on different calculation
methods is that the information varies in terms of the shape and scale
of the density zones. Therefore, point sampling was done by extracting
values of ppUCC, ppKDE, and ppDIV at the centroids of the Topographic
database's (NLS, 2014) road segments from the Helsinki region for

regression analysis purposes. The extraction was done by a nearest
neighbor assignment for ppUCC, and by a bilinear interpolation for
ppKDE and ppDIV. Manual bicycle counting was done at 94 counting
points in early June 2013, during one weekday between 7 AM–7 PM,
and this was transformed to 24 h counts with a supply from semantically near automatic counting stations (Hellman, 2014). The precise
locations of the counting sites were undocumented, but road segments
used for the counting were published, and we adjusted the location of
the 89 unambiguous points to correspond to the local maxima of the
heat maps (Fig. 3).
3. Results and discussion
In general, the three methods for deriving heat maps produced
similar looking results, but when focusing on the details, some major
differences could be found. In the simplest heat map based on ppUCC
(Fig. 4a), patterns of the popularity of cycling in the region became
clearly visible, but the problem appeared to be a lack of knowledge
about the density of the trajectories. For example, in ppUCC, a road
segment with 100 workouts recorded by 10 users got the same heat
map score as a segment with 10 workouts recorded by 10 users. In
ppKDE (Fig. 4b), the density of the trajectories became visible and the
previously mentioned limitation of ppUCC was surpassed, but a single
very active user may result in signiﬁcant bias and overestimation of
the route section's popularity (Fig. 4a, highlights A and B). In ppDIV
(Fig. 4c), we took into account the density of the workout trajectories
and the diversity of users, which resulted in a heat map that closely
corresponded to ppKDE but that did not suffer from the bias introduced
by very active application users.
To further compare the methods, regression analysis between
ppUCC, ppKDE, and ppDIV was performed on the point sample, based
on the centroids of all road segments in the study region. In accordance
with our expectations the coefﬁcients of determination for regression
models were high (Fig. 5), R2 = 0.83–0.94 with the highest coefﬁcient
being between ppKDE and ppDIV (Fig. 5c), revealing the similarity of
the methods in general. Most often, the low number of users was associated with a small number of individual tracks, and a large number of
users also indicated a large number of tracks. However, the most
interesting features of the regression models were found from a spatial
analysis of the residuals of the models.
By residual analysis we could ﬁnd answers to questions such as why
a large number of tracks were not always related to a large number of
users (Fig. 5a), and where were the places where the impact of taking
the diversity of users into account in the calculation of densities of trajectories was the biggest (Fig. 5c). Observations below the regression
curve in Fig. 5a revealed road segments where the density of trajectories
(ppKDE) was lower than might have been expected according to the
number of individual users (ppUCC). When plotting those parts of the
observations on the map (Fig. 6a, blue dots), we could see that many
of these road segments are important through-roads and entry cycling
roads to downtown Helsinki. These also appeared to be routes not

favored by the most active cyclists, by whom we mean cyclists actively
tracking their workouts. In the opposite case (Fig. 6a, red dots), the density of trajectories (ppKDE) was higher than predicted based on the
number of individual users (ppUCC). These were found from the routes
with very active cyclists, either because of the route's popularity among
the enthusiastic sports cyclists or because of a very active user using the
Sports Tracking application to track daily commuting trips. While the
ﬁrst group is interesting in terms of ﬁnding the most popular routes
for cycling, the second group clearly displays bias, and it should be
possible to ﬁlter it out from the results.
In a similar manner, analyzing residuals from the regression model
between ppKDE and ppDIV revealed the road segments where the diversity of the users had the biggest impact on ppKDE. Again, observations below the regression curve in Fig. 5c revealed road segments
where a low diversity of users decreased the density value in the heat
map (Fig. 6b, blue dots). In other words, they were the road segments
where either a single cyclist or very few active cyclists had caused the
largest positive bias in ppKDE. In the opposite case (Fig. 6b, red dots),
a high diversity of users had resulted in a relative increase in ppKDE.
These road segments appeared to be mostly the same important
through-roads and entry cycling roads to downtown Helsinki,
highlighted in blue in Fig. 6a.
When comparing our heat maps to real-world data, all methods for
deriving heat maps performed almost equally well (Fig. 7). Any of the
heat maps can be used in predicting 24 h bicycle counting data, keeping
in mind the coefﬁcients of determination, R2 = 0.49–0.50 (p b 0.001).
In practice this means that while, in many places, heat maps and realworld counting data had a clear connection, there are places where
predictions based on heat maps fail. This may result at least partly
from a temporal mismatch of the datasets and fundamental changes
occurring in the cycling infrastructure. From the ten largest absolute
residuals in the regression model between ppDIV and 24 h counting
data (Fig. 7c, red and blue highlighting), we see that in 80% of the residuals, real-world 24 h counting data was greater compared to the predicted value based on ppDIV, and for only 20% the opposite was true.
When these ten largest residuals were plotted on a map (Fig. 8), we
noticed that the maximum (point 26) was located on Baana, a popular
cycle path opened on June 12th 2012. Our data covered the time period
from April 17th 2010 to November 21st 2012, which means that only
the last 6 months of our data contained cyclists using Baana. A similar
fundamental change in cycling infrastructure had taken place near measurement point 13 where the new cycle and pedestrian bridge Aurora
was inaugurated in late 2012 (HS, 2012). The other large positive residuals could at least partly be explained by the overall increase in cycling
(Hellman, 2013), which has been most signiﬁcant on main entry cycleways to the city (points 7, 16, 21, 28, and 30). Together with the essential cycle-way through downtown Helsinki (point 27), these might also
be locations where the difference between everyday cyclists and cyclists
using Sports Tracker to record their workouts is largest. At points 7, 16,
30, and 28, manual bicycle counting data has been collected for opposite
lanes, and the data was generalized to a single point. Using this method

to derive heat maps may be insensitive to the trafﬁc on different lanes
and underestimates the popularity indicating problems induced by
the size of the calculation window. On the other hand, at point 8, the

manual counting data has been collected only from one side of the
road, and a generalization of the result into a single point resulted in a
large positive bias in prediction. The other negative residual (point

4) might be explained by the construction site of Koivusaari metro station, which affected routes in 2013. When we compared the location of
all the above-mentioned positive residuals to the distance zones in Helsinki (Fig. 3), they were all within a 2.5 km radius from the city center.
Finally, when the observations resulting in the ten largest residuals
were removed from the data (Fig. 9a), the coefﬁcient of determination
for predicting the number of cyclists based on ppDIV rose to R2 =
0.76 (p b 0.001). When focusing on the ten largest residuals, and by removing the points where signiﬁcant changes in cycling infrastructure
have occurred (points 13, 26, and 4) and where uncertainty due to
a mismatch in in-situ counting and the heat map was the largest
(point 8), we also got a high coefﬁcient of determination, R2 =
0.72 (p = 0.15) (Fig. 9b). Furthermore, if the points for Töölönranta
(point 21) and Kaisaniemenranta (point 30) were removed, the coefﬁcient of determination rose to R2 = 0.96 (p = 0.20). This clearly indicates that, in our case study, a calibration of heat maps with the
absolute number of cyclists outside a 2.5 km radius can be done with
moderate accuracy, and calibration of the city center heat map would
be best done as a separate processing step.
To summarize the methods (Table 1), it appears that the advantages
of ppUCC are the simplicity of the calculation and the intuitive quantity
of the result, the number of different users per quadrant. In addition,
ppUCC automatically reduces the impact of very active cyclists and
therefore, for example, diminishes the bias caused by active commuters.
The disadvantage of ppUCC is that it ignores the density of trajectories

and therefore brings, for example, mass sports events with a large number of individual athletes into the heat maps. In ppKDE, the density of
trajectories is calculated using the well-established kernel density estimation, but individual active cyclists may introduce signiﬁcant bias into
the heat map. In addition, the unit of the heat map is not intuitive, even
though in a visual interpretation of the results, the unit of the quantity is
noncritical. A novel method introduced in this paper is ppDIV, which
combines the best properties of the previously mentioned methods. It
takes into account the density of the workout trajectories, as well as
the diversity of the users who have tracked the workouts. Therefore,
an individual athlete has no signiﬁcant impact on the resulting heat
map, and the computational biases of ppUCC and ppKDE are eliminated.
A disadvantage of all the methods is that the results depend on the subjective deﬁnition of the size of the calculation window. This decision
should be based, on one hand, on the positioning uncertainty of the
workout trajectories, and on the other hand, on the desired level of detail of the ﬁnal results.

4. Conclusions
In this paper, we have introduced a privacy-preserving diversity
method (ppDIV) for deriving heat maps from mobile sports tracking application data, which takes into account the density of the trajectories
and the diversity of the users. The method was applied to Sports
Tracker's public cycling workouts and compared with privacypreserving kernel density estimation (ppKDE) and privacy-preserving
user count calculation (ppUCC). In addition, we demonstrated a method
for calibrating the cycling heat map with in-situ bicycle counting data.

The results show that ppUCC, ppKDE, and ppDIV reveal different
aspects of the popularity of cycling, and they all are sensitive in different
ways to bias issues in the mobile sports tracking data. The order of superiority between them depends on the requirements set for the ﬁnal result, but for general purposes, ppDIV offers the most neutral view on the
popularity of cycling, and hides the bias issues related to, for example,
very active application users. The ﬁnal added-value application that
would inspire and support visual reasoning with the aim of choosing
attractive routes for cycling could be further improved by allowing the
end-user to ﬁlter the heat map based on subjective preferences on, for
example, speed and time of day or year.
A balance between location privacy and data accuracy is an important but thus far largely uninvestigated topic in the context of heat
maps. In our study area, k-Anonymity-based privacy preservation of
the heat maps could be seen as a valid technique to guarantee the
non-disclosure of individual users without diminishing the value of
the service to the end-users. Still, an open question remains whether
the value k should be a function of the density of the population or
the underlying road network to protect the conﬁdentiality of sensitive
locations even in areas where there are small variations in the routes.
A similar issue has been discussed in many geographical masking
studies that have suggested weighting the displacement distance by
population density because in less densely populated areas the risk of
re-identiﬁcation is higher (e.g., Armstrong and Ruggles, 2005; Kwan
et al., 2004; Murad et al., 2014; Seidl et al., 2015).
When considering the usability of our heat maps from a cityplanning perspective, the chosen approach for big data analytics
appears to be promising. Despite the recognized bias issues, due to a selected group of cyclists tracking their workouts, as well as participation
inequality, calibration results for our heat maps are surprisingly good.
When doing regression modeling between in-situ bicycle counting
data and ppDIV heat map scores, by splitting the data based on a
2.5 km distance from the city center, the coefﬁcients of determination
rise to R2 N 0.7. Most likely, the coefﬁcients of determination would be
even higher when bicycle counting data and the heat map are derived
from the same period of time. This clearly shows the potential of utilizing heat maps in a city-planning context by using the in-situ bicycle
counting data to get the absolute scale and the heat map for getting a
high level of detail and a large spatial coverage of cycling activities.
The use of big data from mobile sports apps also offers a chance for
signiﬁcant savings in the investments made in light trafﬁc counting. In
the long term this could signiﬁcantly help to improve cycling
infrastructure development and planning. Still, it is worth noting that
big data analytics does not replace the need for in-situ bicycle counting
since uncalibrated heat maps suffer from the bias issues caused by a
behaviorally biased subset of cyclists using mobile applications to
track their routes, as well as participation inequality.
