Diet
• American Medical Association in 2013
• Recognized obesity as a disease officially [1]

• What is the effective method to treat and prevent the obesity?
• Existing Diet Monitoring and Problems
• Self-monitoring
• Low adherence, underreporting, and recall error

• Smartphone camera based monitoring (State-of-the-art )
• User inconvenience
• Segment multiple foods to each single food
• Select a food location in the image (Rectangle)

• Fairly low food type identification accuracy (63%)

• Contributions: Fuse Thermal and Visual Spectra
• Thermal and Color image correct each other
• Results
• Segment multiple foods to each single food automatically
• High accuracy of identifying types of food (88.93%)
• State-of-art systems have accuracy at most 63%

Challenges for Image Based
Food Segmentation (1)
• Visual spectra may not have defined boundaries
• Thermal boundaries more significant
Better Contrast

Challenges for Image Based
Food Segmentation (2)
• Color (Gradient) and Texture are important features for identification
• Food items of same color as plate may be lost in visual spectra
• Fusion of visual and infrared spectra
Contour Detection
Image Segmentation

Hierarchical Image Segmentation (HIS) [3]
12

Challenges for Image Based
Food Segmentation (3)
• Food items not heated enough get deleted in DTT output
• Color image can recognize the food

Which portions
are food?

Exact food portions and
locations along with

Label Matching
• Identifies unique food items in both infrared and visual spectra
