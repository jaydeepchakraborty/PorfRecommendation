We consider a city where induction-based vehicle count sensors are installed at some, but not all street junctions. Each sensor regularly outputs a count and a saturation value. We first use a discrete time Gauss-Markov model based on historical data to predict the evolution of these saturation values, and then a Gaussian Process derived from the street graph to extend these predictions to all junctions. We construct this model based on real data collected in Dublin city.

INTRODUCTION

In the Greater Dublin Area, 750 (4%) junctions are covered by one or several SCATS (Sydney Co-ordinated Adaptive Traffic System) vehicle count sensors. Our goal is to provide estimates of the saturation at each junction, for the current and future times, whereas our previous work [1] only did so for each junction at the current time. High traffic saturation (cars/km) co-occurs with low traffic flux (cars/hour) and is an indicator for congestions [3].

Our work can be used for online signaling and trip planning. The urban street network is a graph (V, E ), where the vertices V are the junctions and the edges E the street segments. Let u be the set of unobserved junctions, with no SCATS sensor, and -u = V \u the junctions with sensors. The saturation of a junction vi at a time t is a continuous random variable yi,t . Furthermore, yu,t  {yi,t }i:vi u . We combine two components to obtain an estimate of the saturation of all junctions at future time steps, yV,t+t , conditioned on the current observations, y-u,t (t  N0 ). The first one, P (y-u,t+t |y-u,t ), models historical measurements. It can estimate future measurements y ^-u,t+t , based on the current observations y ^-u,t : y ^-u,t+t = E (y-u,t+t |y ^-u,t ) .

The second is a Gaussian Process (GP) based on the street network and defining a multivariate Gaussian distribution P (yV,t ) over the saturations at all junctions. Conditioning this distribution on y-u provides P (yu,t+t |y-u,t+t ) and allows to estimate saturations at junctions without sensors: P (yu,t+t |y-u,t )  P (yu,t+t |y ^-u,t+t ) . Figure 1 illustrates the resulting prediction procedure. (2)

We average all measurements received on non-overlapping 4 minutes intervals, because of missing values, and model the resulting averages from 5am ¯ t , wt change for every time to 12am. The parameters At , w ¯ 0 and 0 . step but are identical for every day. So are y Following the methodology of [6], each matrix At is learned using (averaged) measurements for t  {t - t , . . . , t + t }, weighted by a Gaussian kernel: exp(-(t - t )2 /t ). We arbitrarily use t = 3. For each matrix At , each row ri,t is estimated using an elastic net [7] and ten-fold cross-validation. 0 and each wt are diagonal covariance matrices estimated by maximum likelihood. Alternatively, penalized estimation algorithms such as the graphical lasso [2] could be used.

A similar approach was proposed to provide dynamic cost predictions for a trip planner in the same workshop [4]. Instead of a linear dynamical system (LDS), a spatio-temporal Markov random field (STMRF) is used. It models discretized saturation values only, and inference is approximated by belief propagation whereas it is computationally tractable and performed exactly in LDS. Our model also has a finer temporal resolution. Therefore, it can be used for signaling or online adaptation of the route in addition to offline trip planning. Comparing these two models in terms of precision and speed would be interesting. The Gauss Markov model assumes the dynamics are linear, first-order Markov and perturbed by Gaussian noise. More refined models could be considered and might lead to better estimations.In particular, we could assume the measurements are noisy observations of a hidden process. Other information could also be leveraged. For example, the street network could be used to derive a prior on the coefficient of the transition matrix, influencing the model only. Irregular, pointwise traffic estimation (for example based on mobile phones or GPS) could be integrated into the Gaussian Process to produce finer saturation estimates. Finally, different dynamics could be estimated and used in the presence or the absence of rain, modifying both the model and the estimation process.

P (yu,t+t |y-u,t+t ) is derived from a GP regression framework modeling traffic saturation values of all junctions at a given time, similar to [5]. Multiple sensors at a junction are averaged. For each vertex vi , we introduce a latent variable fi , the true traffic saturation at vi : yi = f i +

We assume that the random vector of all latent variables follows a GP: any finite set f = {fi }i=1,...,M has a multivariate Gaussian distribution. Therefore, the vector of observed traffic saturations (y-u ) and unobserved traffic saturations (du ) follows a Gaussian distribution y-u N du 0, K-u,-u +  2 I Ku,-u K-u,u Ku,u , (7)

DISCUSSION

We have described a combination of two models able to respectively predict future traffic saturations at junctions with sensors and to extend these predictions to junctions without sensors, in a city. To the best of our knowledge, no similar model has been proposed before.
