related to HPV infections are about $1.7 billion [2], similar to the
direct medical costs associated with HIV infection among
individuals aged 15-24 years old [3]. For females, HPV is highly
associated with cervical cancer; over 70% of cervical cancer is
caused by infection with HPV types 16 and 18 [4]. For males,
HPV can cause genital warts and head/neck, penile, and anal
cancer. Male HPV infection also increases the risk of HPV
infection in their female sexual partners [5]. Besides morbidity
and mortality attributed to HPV-associated cancers, HPV
infection is also associated with negative psychosocial outcomes
(e.g., anger, fear) in HPV-positive women [6]. Given the health
and economic burden of HPV infection, the need to address this
public health issue through vigorous prevention efforts, including
HPV vaccination, becomes clear.
HPV vaccines are efficacious in preventing HPV-associated
cancers and diseases, and the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention [CDC] recommends that they be part of the routine
vaccinations of both boys and girls at age 11 or 12 years [7].
Latinos have higher rates of HPV associated cancers than their
counterparts in other racial/ethnic groups [8], [9], however, the
vaccination rate in Latino adolescents remain low.
Unprecedented advances in information technology provide new
avenues to create individualized health interventions in a more
confidential, sensitive, accessible, and engaging manner.
Research shows the effectiveness of a number of computer-based
educational interventions related to health such as cancer
screening [10], [11], decision making in cancer treatment [12],
[13], healthcare services use among individuals newly diagnosed
with cancer [14], and HIV/STI prevention [15]. Furthermore,
research (e.g., [16], [17]) has demonstrated that computer-based
educational interventions with tailored messages that target
specific populations and personally adapted feedback about an
individual’s current health behaviors and beliefs can be effective
in motivating the individual to change or maintain behaviors. Our
application “We Care” shows promise to increase Latino parents’
intention to vaccinate their adolescent children against HPV via
linguistically and culturally relevant messages tailored to their
specific needs. The major contribution of this paper is to describe
the process and considerations in designing a cost-effective
application to promote HPV vaccination in an at-risk population.

ABSTRACT
In this paper we present an innovative, computer-tailored
application aimed at increasing Latino parents’ intention to
vaccinate their adolescent children against Human Papilloma
Virus (HPV). HPV infection is the most common sexually
transmitted infection in the United States. Latinas have the
highest age-adjusted incidence rate for HPV-associated cervical
cancer compared with their counterparts in other racial/ethnic
groups. HPV vaccines offer hope against HPV-associated
diseases. Because parental consent is required for children under
age 18 to receive t h e HPV vaccination in most U. S. states,
parents’ attitudes and intention to have their children vaccinated
are keys for promoting HPV vaccination. As health care providers
often find it challenging to provide HPV vaccination education in
clinical settings due to competing demands, we developed a
computer-tailored application as an innovative and feasible
approach to address this gap. The preliminary data suggest that
our design is promising for increasing Latino parents’ intention
to vaccinate their adolescent children. In this paper we will
provide the design of the application, preliminary findings and
future plans.

2. RELATED WORK AND SIGNIFICANCE
Several factors have been identified as associated with low HPV
vaccination rates in Latino adolescents. Latino parents have been
found to be significantly less likely than white parents to be aware
of HPV vaccines [18]. HPV vaccines are relatively new, and

59

parents have concerns regarding their effectiveness and safety
[19], [20]. Confusion about the link between HPV and cervical
cancer, a lack of knowledge about the vaccine itself, and concerns
that the vaccination may encourage early sexual behavior also
influence Latino parents’ willingness to consent their children to
receive HPV vaccines [20], [21]. Other identified barriers to
receiving HPV vaccines include a lack of health insurance,
poverty, language and acculturation issues, and limited access to
healthcare [20], [21], [22]. Of the few existing HPV vaccination
promotion interventions targeting children and adolescents, most
of them have focused only on girls [23], [24], [25]; half of them
did not include vaccine uptake as an outcome [23], [24]; and only
one study targeted the Latino population [24].
Computer-based health education delivers information that can be
tailored to individual risk factors or diagnoses, is self-paced, and
is considered more relevant by patients [17]. Touch screen and
interactive computer programs are supported as practical, private,
and user-friendly methods of collecting health-related data and
delivering education [17], [26], [27]. Kreuter et al. [28] defined
tailored interventions as “any combination of information or
change strategies intended to reach one specific person, based on
characteristics that are unique to that person, related to the
outcome of interest, and derived from an individual assessment”
(p. 277). Using tailored messages in computer-based health
education can provide personally adapted feedback about an
individual’s current health behaviors, factors associated with the
behaviors, and suggestions to motivate the individual to change or
maintain behavior [17]. Thus, individuals who receive tailored
information are more likely to remember the customized
messages, which may lead to desired behavioral change [15].
Tailored interventions have been shown to be more efficacious
than non-tailored ones [15], [16], [26], [29], [30]. Research also
suggests that (1) an education tailored on 4-5 theoretical concepts
is more effective than tailoring on fewer concepts; (2) tailoring on
attributes such as beliefs/attitudes is associated with the largest
effect sizes; and (3) tailoring to demographic characteristics such
as age, gender, and race/ethnicity in addition to the behavior of
interest may further enhance the effectiveness of theoretically
tailored interventions [30]. Computer-tailored health education
shows high a potential to change an individual’s knowledge,
attitudes/beliefs, and ultimately healthy behaviors and can be
delivered in clinic settings when having discussions about health
may be most relevant. To our knowledge, this is the first
bilingual, computer-tailored health education program designed
for Latino parents to increase HPV vaccination rates among their
adolescent boys and girls.
The primary aims of this pilot study are to (1) develop a bilingual,
computer-tailored health education program for Latino parents of
adolescent children aged 11-17; (2) examine feasibility and
acceptability of the health education program; (3) investigate the
preliminary efficacy of the health education program on parental
intention to vaccinate their children against HPV. The long-term
goal is to conduct a rigorous, randomized controlled trial (RCT)
to examine its efficacy. A successful health education of this
nature also has the potential to have a positive impact on HPV
vaccination among other populations. Furthermore, the findings
will extend the science in using innovative computer technology
to reduce racial and ethnic disparities in the incidence of HPVassociated cancers. This paper presents the first phase of this
series of research.

3. DESIGN METHODOLOGY
The Precede-Proceed Model (PPM) [31] provides the basis for
developing tailored messages in our health education program.
According to Phase 4 of the PPM, which deals with individual
behavior change, predisposing factors are defined as factors that
are antecedents to the behavior change, while enabling factors act
as external resources that facilitate behavior change [32]. We also
integrate constructs from health beliefs model [33] and the theory
of planned behavior [34], which are known to influence HPV
vaccination behavior [36], [37], into a conceptual framework for
our health education development (Fig.1). Our health education
program includes tailored messages to address each of the
predisposing factors (knowledge, perceived risk, facilitators,
barriers, cultural beliefs), which would increase Latino parents’
intention to vaccinate their adolescent children.

Figure 1. Conceptual framework
Table 1 gives an example of the tailored messages and
corresponding constructs that might appear on the touchscreen for
a 36-year-old mother who has an 11-year-old son.

<List steps/resources of
HPV vaccination>

When the user first uses the HPV application on the touchscreen
tablet, s/he will complete a brief survey (T0). Each question in the
T0 survey is mapped to a learning objective and is recorded.
Throughout the application flow, the user selects responses, each
corresponding to one or more learning objectives. At the end, the
user takes another survey. Each portion of the interaction is
recorded. Based on the data collected at different time points, the
user’s learning margin can be determined, thus measuring which
topics are more prone to misconceptions than others and how
beneficial the application is.
This application was developed using a user-driven approach. A
prototype was created, shown to users, and then revised based on
user feedback. This process was repeated, focusing on
improvements to usability and learning outcomes. Table 2
describes the technologies used to build the application.

4. SOFTWARE DESIGN
The HPV application accomplishes program objectives through
an interactive conversation simulation. The user is presented with
a conversational avatar (a nurse, in this case) who converses with
the user regarding the virus, and steps s/he can take to reduce
her/his child’s risk of contracting HPV. A turn-based system is
used, in which the avatar speaks, and the user is presented with
response options. After the user responds, the avatar calculates a
response and presents it to the user via text and speech (using the
Speech API version 5.1) [35].

Table 2. Technologies used for development

4.1 Application Objectives and Constraints
The HPV application has the following main
objectives:
• Enhance knowledge regarding HPV and vaccines
• Prepare Latino parents of children at-risk for HPV to
take steps to minimize the risk for their children
• Increase knowledge retention and maximize the learning
margin
• Provide an interface to monitor the effectiveness of the
application, and the learning margin of the participants
Additionally, the following constraint is considered
primary:
• The target audience is a middle-aged, lowerincome community. As such, technological proficiency
is assumed to be low.

4.4 Ethical Considerations
There are no physical risks associated with participation.
Participants are informed that they can skip any questions they
wish not to answer. To ensure confidentiality of participants, no
personal identifiers (e.g., name, SSN) are collected. Participants
create a unique user name when enrolled, so we can link the data
collected at different time points. Data collected via computers
were saved and managed using a secure, web-based application
“REDCap” hosted at a HIPPA-compliant secure server via a
university-wide research storage system. REDCap [38] is
designed to support data collection (http://www.projectredcap.org), and provides: (1) an intuitive interface for validated
data entry; (2) audit trails for tracking data manipulation and
export procedures; (3) automated export procedures for seamless
data downloads to common statistical packages; and (4)
procedures for importing data from external sources. All online

4.2 Conversation Tree
The response calculation considers the child’s gender and the
user’s knowledge of the subject. If the user makes invalid
assumptions or statements, a “remediation response” will be
triggered to correct the misassumption, misconception, or invalid
knowledge. An example of a conversation tree is shown in Figure
2. Depending on the user’s child’s statistics, a different
conversation branch will be entered. This allows the information
to be specific to the user and thus increase relevance. In turn, this

61

connectivity is via Secure Socket Layer (SSL) with maximum
available (128 bit) encryption of data traffic to ensure HIPAA
compliance. Data access is restricted to the staff who are on the
Authorized Personnel list. Access is password protected and
written standard operating procedures are used to protect the data
from error, negligence, misconduct, conflict of interest, malicious
acts, and catastrophe. We publish only aggregate data to protect
the anonymity of the participants.

5. IMPLEMENTATION
Given clinicians’ limited availability to provide health education,
our computer-tailored program can be a feasible and costeffective tool in a busy clinic environment to increase patients’
health knowledge and to promote their behavioral changes.
We collaborate with County Department of Public Health to
implement this program in a vaccine clinic that serves a primarily
under- or uninsured population. We plan to collect 36 Latino
parents to examine feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary
efficacy (effect size). We will also interview four healthcare
providers in the vaccine clinic to seek their opinions about
integrating this tool into their daily clinic routine.
On a touchscreen tablet, eligible Latino parents first choose the
language they prefer to use. They create a unique user ID based
on our guideline. Once they enter the user ID, they choose the
gender of the target child aged 11-17 who has not received HPV
vaccination. After the welcome statement, they are led to
messages tailored to their HPV-related knowledge, the risk they
perceive of their child becoming infected with HPV, facilitators
and barriers associated with their children’s HPV vaccination, and
cultural beliefs that influence their decision to vaccinate their
adolescent children.
For the HPV knowledge items, participants receive slightly
different feedback messages after they select an answer. If their
answer is correct, the feedback message will start with
"Congratulations…" If they answer incorrectly, the feedback
message will be "Actually …” The purpose of showing the
correct knowledge statement regardless of the answer is to
reinforce the parent’s understanding. For items about perceived
risk, facilitators, barriers, and cultural beliefs, participants receive
feedback message depending on condition that is applicable to
them. For instance, for participants who select "Because my
child’s doctor or nurse does not suggest it" as a barrier to
vaccinate their adolescent children against HPV, a feedback
message will pop up to address this barrier: "Perhaps your doctor
or nurse has not had the opportunity to tell you about getting your
child vaccinated to prevent HPV infection. It’s okay to ask your
doctor or nurse about HPV vaccination for your child even if the
doctor or nurse has not yet discussed it." Participants who do not
select it as a barrier will not receive a feedback message and will
be led to next barrier option.
An updated resource sheet containing local and state information
about vaccine clinics and health insurance coverage will appear
when participants indicate a need (e.g., they do not know where to
receive HPV vaccines and/or do not know if they are eligible for
free or discount HPV vaccines). After participants complete the
HPV education, which takes about 15-20 minutes, we thank them
for their time and effort. Figure 3 demonstrates some of the
features described above.

Figure 3. User Interaction Screens
In this computer-tailored education program, participants have the
option of receiving the tailored messages verbally, narrated by a
female voice (in both English and Spanish) instead of reading the
messages. Messages addressing knowledge include 14 messages
about HPV risk in the adolescent population, its link with cervical
cancer and other diseases, how to prevent HPV, HPV vaccine
type, dose and safety issues. Nine messages were developed to
address Latino parents’ perceived risk regarding their child's
acquisition of HPV infection based on child’s age, sex,
race/ethnicity, sexual behavior and orientation, family history of
cancer, signs/symptoms, general health or other reasons. Nine
messages were developed to address the facilitators for HPV
vaccination, such as the health care provider’s suggestions,
encouragement from religious leaders/pastors, and beliefs that the
HPV vaccination will save a child’s life. We developed 21
messages to assess barriers (e.g., lack of health insurance, worry
about the safety of the vaccines), and so the educational messages
can be tailored based on barriers identified by each participant.
Five messages about cultural beliefs relevant to HPV vaccination
(e.g., faith in God can protect my child from the disease) are also
included. Table 3 shows an example of the algorithm used in this
application.

6. PRELIMINARY FINDINGS

REFERENCES

We have enrolled 20 Latino parents (mean age = 39.5; SD =
4.6). Sixteen of them (80%) chose the Spanish version
program. A total of 15 participants have completed the
education program and surveys. Majority of the participants
were able to complete the education program and surveys in the
clinic, suggesting the feasibility of implementing it in the
clinical environment. Participants also showed high
acceptability of the computer-tailored education program,
evident by the acceptability score (range 11-44; mean score =
37.4). Regarding the length of the time required to complete the
education program and surveys, 66.7% participants reported
that “it is adequate,” 6.7% said that “it is short,” and 26.7%
reported that “it is somewhat long.” It was also encouraging to
know that they have found the HPV application installed in the
touchscreen tablet easy to use.
Our preliminary data suggested that Latino parents’ intention to
vaccinate their adolescent children have been increased after
receiving this education program. In fact, three participants
consented their children for the HPV vaccines right after
completing our program, another three made appointments, and
one expressed the interest but would wait until the child turned
13 years old.
This computer-tailored education program is innovative in
several ways. First, it addresses a significant public health
issue, HPV infection and associated cancers in both Latino
adolescent boys and girls while most of the research in this area
focuses only on girls. Second, the content is tailored to
individual characteristics (e.g., sex, age) associated with the
parents’ decision about their child’s HPV vaccination uptake.
Thus, the tailored content is more relevant to the parents, and
ultimately is more effective. Third, this education program is
delivered by touchscreen tablets, which are user-friendly for
individuals with limited experiences with technology. Fourth,
individuals with lower health literacy are more likely to
misunderstand and feel frustrated with health promotion
education compared with individuals with adequate health
literacy. We attempt to address this challenge by ensuring the
bilingual intervention materials are at the 8th-grade reading
level. The voiceover feature of the education also increases
accessibility for low health literacy and low vision users.

7. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK
We describe an innovative, computer-tailored, health education
application aimed at increasing Latino parents’ knowledge and
intention to vaccinate their adolescent children against HPV.
The preliminary findings based on this real-world testing are
promising. Collaborating with a county vaccine clinic that
serves primarily low-income ethnic minority population, we
continue collecting data to examine its feasibility, acceptability
and short-term efficacy in our target population. If it is shown
to be feasible, acceptable and effective in clinical settings,
implementing a computer-tailored education program to
promote HPV vaccination can be time- and cost-effective.

Abstract—The increased dependence on computer programming
in engineering has made it essential for engineering students to
learn about programming throughout their undergraduate
education. In the same vein, computing students benefit when
given an opportunity to learn more about engineering design and
systematic thinking. This paper discusses how one college
embedded computing and engineering into a combined first-year
introductory course. The course fuses computing and engineering
using game design and robotics as an offering for both cohorts of
students to work together in a multidisciplinary environment.
Over the course of the semester, students learn introductory
computing and engineering design concepts by designing games
and robots using informatics tools to solve design challenges.
Interdisciplinary teams consisting of computing and engineering
students work together to prototype a game design idea and then
bring that idea to life using robots as part of their final project.

I.

INTRODUCTION

Understanding of and an ability to program has become an
essential skill for engineers to learn since the creation of the
computer. The increased reliance on computing to address
engineering needs has rapidly increased the number of
programming-based courses required to receive an engineering
degree. A parallel need also exists for computing students to
understand the principles of engineering as it relates to design,
problem solving, and applied learning [1]. The ability to think
in a design-centered way and approach problems
systematically are skills that assist engineering and computing
students in problem solving. The intended goal of these two
learning objectives suggests a mutual give and take that lends
itself ideally to a multidisciplinary approach. Yet, common
offerings to address the learning of these skills have taken on a
“siloed” or separate disciplinary structure where engineering
and computing students learn these skills separately [2]. This
has several pitfalls; the most severe being that underclassmen
lack the maturity or the far-sightedness to understand why
they have to learn the basics of other disciplines if it is not
their intended major [3, 4].
The following work-in-progress discusses the creation of a

978-1-4673-1352-0/12/$31.00 ©2012 IEEE

fused multidisciplinary computing and engineering course,
similar to that of Xu et al. [5], that relies heavily on the
principles of game design [6] and LEGO® Mindstorms®
robotics [7, 8]. The course was designed and taught by a
computing and engineering faculty team – one instructor from
each discipline. Students in both engineering and computing
enrolled in the course together during their first-year to create
a multidisciplinary experience.
II.

COURSE DESIGN

In 2009, the computing department merged with the
engineering department allowing for an opportunity to fuse
each disciplines separate introductory courses. Teams of
computing and engineering faculty began offering these fused
introductory classes. The fused computing and engineering
course is taught as part of a required first-year project spine.
Anecdotally, the faculty found that the courses were not
preparing students well enough for the subsequent second-year
courses in both engineering and computing, especially in
computing. The courses were technically fused, but in practice
became essentially two courses taught during one insufficient
time block.
A new approach was piloted during the Spring 2012
semester to explore how a combination of game design and
robotics would impact the computing-engineering fusion. The
course was designed to utilize the strengths of the department,
to make use of the flexibility of both media to address
computing and engineering content, and to learn how the
benefits of learning robotics and game design separately could
be applied to one another.
As shown in Figure 1, students started out by learning the
principles of programming using a drag and drop tool
(GameMaker™) to design games. They then transitioned into
another drag and drop tool (ROBOLAB™) to learn the
principles of engineering design. The two skills were then
combined via a final project. The final project placed the
emphasis on game design to prototype the solution for an
engineering design problem (i.e. iterate, test and refine the
solution). Robotics was then applied to finish the real- world

that all of the students, particularly the computing students,
needed practice with written code, including an ability to
identify what a drag and drop function would look like if
written. This proved to be a difficult transition for many of the
students with the limited time given to learn the skill.

implementation of the solution. Multiple projects for each of
the first two sections were used to ensure students had
opportunities to display their competency and to work in many
different groups. A flipped classroom approach (reverse
teaching-homework paradigm) was also used to save class
time for hands-on assignments and troubleshooting [9-11].
The overall curriculum design aimed to extract the benefits of
gaming and robotics in harmony with one another in a way
that showcases the importance of learning both computing and
engineering design fundamentals.
III.

COURSES ASSESSMENT

During the Spring 2012 semester, one of four sections
consisting of twenty-one students, used the combined game
design and robotics curriculum. The cohort of students
consisted of eleven declared computing students and ten
declared engineering students. The course was assessed
throughout the semester using student reflections to determine
the effectiveness of this approach. Students provided feedback
on the content and identified the “muddiest point”, i.e. what
was most confusing, each week (source of quotes seen below).
A. Game Design
Game design was received well by the students. The drag
and drop style programming of GameMaker made it
straightforward and easy for students to learn through the
online video tutorials. The majority of students found
“GameMaker [to] definitely [be] an interesting learning
experience.” The flipped classroom approach made it easy for
the instructors to help students learn the basic skills necessary
to program in GameMaker. Individual and group assignments
were then completed in class in an environment that allowed
students to consult one another. Students generally “…enjoyed
working on assignments in class in collaboration with other
students.”
The most common “muddiest point” was the conversion
from drag and drop to written script. The instructors agreed

B. Robotics
The easy assembly and familiarity with the LEGO products
made it easy for students to design and construct their ideas.
Students found the robotics section to “Overall [be] a pretty
enlightening experience” that gave students “... a great
concept on how to be an engineer.”
The programming was a natural extension of the game
design section. ROBOLAB is also a drag and drop program
that runs within LabVIEW™ Software; the chosen
programming language used in the second-year engineering
project courses.
As opposed to the game design section, the robotics section
utilized teams of students to complete a series of tasks. The
explicit team projects were enjoyed by all of the students.
C. Final Project
The biggest challenge of the game design—robotics
curriculum was determining how to combine the two media
into a natural final project. While both utilize a drag and drop
approach to programming, the two programs do not naturally
interact with one another. To temper the compatibility issue, it
was decided that students would design a two-player game.
First, the students would draw up multiple ideas for their game
in written form. Second, the students would create a video
game version of the game using GameMaker. The video game
would act as a simulation of a physical game. Finally, the
teams were tasked with creating a physical version of the
video game using robotics.
IV.

CONCLUSIONS & FUTURE WORK

Our preliminary results suggest the use of game design and
robotics as natural media to include in a fused computing and
engineering introductory course. The skills required to
complete game design and robotic activities complement and
enhance each other. The two media are also viewed as fun to
the first-year students.
Future assessment of this course will involve an in depth
analysis of how this approach impacts student learning. A
comparison will be made between traditional offerings and the
fused course. Additional quantitative analysis of computing
and engineering design self-efficacy, anxiety, and the
perceived values associated with a computing-engineering
fused course will expand our understanding of this new
appraoch. Research will also identify how best to use a flipped
model classroom by iteratively changing the curriculum to
improve proficiency with programming.

ABSTRACT

1. INTRODUCTION

Obesity among children and adolescents is increasingly becoming a
major public health problem. Poverty and lower socio-economic
status as well as lack of parental awareness regarding a balanced
diet and adequate exercise all contribute towards childhood obesity.
Unfortunately minority children have been especially vulnerable,
among them inner-city Latino children continue to have the highest
incidence rates of overweight and obesity; hence targeted
intervention for this population group is of paramount importance.
Access and affordability of smartphones and mobile internet devices
provide an opportunity to create nutrition education interventions
that can significantly impact and change attitude and knowledge
regarding healthy diet and exercise. In this paper we present the
design of a comic book style interactive storytelling mobile
application that creates multiple cause and effect scenarios that the
child can role play and learn from. The novelty and innovation lies
in the design of the application to begin at a clinical setting while
requiring completion at home and involving significant participation
by the parent and the child.

Recent years have seen a sharp increase in obesity rates among
children and adolescents in the United States. The National Health
and Nutrition Examination Survey [1] indicates that almost a quarter
of preschoolers (2-5 years) and one third of school age children and
adolescents are obese or over weight. There are also significant
socio-economic and racial disparities evident and Latino children
seem to be disproportionately affected by the current obesity
epidemic; 38.6% of Latino girls are overweight or obese compared
to 25.6% white girls, the rates are even more alarming at 42.9%
among 12-19 year old Latino boys [1]. Childhood obesity has been
associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular diseases and
Type II Diabetes leading to significant long-term morbidity [12].
Latino children in the United States are currently at the highest risk
for developing Type II Diabetes when compared to their white
counterparts [13]. Poverty leading to lack of affordability and access
to healthy food are some of the major factors that account for high
overweight and obesity rates among Latino inner city children and
adolescents [14]. In addition, Latino children and adolescents who
are highly acculturated to an American lifestyle have poor eating
habits with greater dependence on fast food and spend less time on
exercise and physical activity [15].

2. RELATED WORK

General Terms

The idea of combining rich cause and effect scenarios in a
healthcare setting is relatively novel and there has not been much
precedent. Games, visualizations and simulations have been used
effectively over the past decade to help with clinical outcomes and
are outlined in [2, 3, and 4]. Specifically games have been really
effective in helping with training medical professionals, whether in
surgical settings or to understand workflow and triaging protocols.
Majority of the applications have been on the caregiving side of
healthcare. Recent research has shown that cause and effect
scenarios are an effective medium of learning [5, 6]. Technology,
specifically smartphone based interventions have become adoptable
over the past few years and their adoption has been discussed in
detail in [7] and specifically the use of games in children and
adolescents for overcoming obesity is discussed in [8 ,9]. The

to move further along/closer to rescuing the parents. A participant
may or may not complete every mission at the first try, but will
always receive a “reward” for making healthy eating and
appropriate physical activity choices. These rewards lead to the
superhero getting stronger and powerful to complete the mission
and finish the story.

majority of the discussions on current state of the art in the use of
apps and games for tackling obesity among children conclude that
the research is not grounded in behavioral change and nutritional
content doesn’t naturally provide recommendations for daily intake
and goal setting. In this paper we outline the design of an interactive
cause and effect story where children make choices and get
rewarded for their actions. The design uses exhaustive nutritional
intake recommendations that are conveyed via a comic-book style
story and provides several opportunities for children to replay, view
and process the result of their actions.

Our hypothesis that such an intervention will enhance knowledge is
based on recent studies that have explored how avatars may
influence individual behaviors [10]. Researchers at Stanford have
started to explore a concept they have labeled the Proteus Effect
[16]. The Proteus Effect is a hypothesis postulating that the behavior
of an individual conforms to implicit cues provided via a digital
self-representation i.e., superhero; For example, research suggests
that if an individual’s avatar is created to be taller, this individual
acts more confident during negotiation tasks [16]. In other research,
individuals that viewed an avatar of themselves running on a
treadmill were more likely to exercise than randomized to a nonexercise condition [17]. Based on the Proteus Effect, actions of an
avatar, (particularly avatars constructed to look like the individual),
can act as a model for an individual’s behavior. Previous research
from social learning theory has highlighted the power of modeling
for skill-building, behavior change, and shifts in self-identity [11].
In theory, an avatar may be a particularly powerful mechanism to
explore for promoting new skills, behaviors, and possibly even selfperceptions - all key tasks for promoting positive behavior change.
ICECS combines the fundamental principles of play therapy with
cognitive behavioral therapy and develops an interactive
intervention for creating a change in knowledge and attitude among
Latino children and adolescents with respect to eating a healthy diet
and regular exercise for optimum future growth and development. A
future study would assess whether this knowledge gain actually
translates to a change in behavior from a virtual world to a real
world.

3. BACKGROUND AND THEORETICAL
FRAMEWORK
Interactive Cause and Effect Comic-book Storytelling (ICECS) is a
new approach to improving healthy life style with respect to
nutrition and physical activity among Latino children. In this study,
Latino ethnicity is defined as per the US National Institutes of
Health (NIH) guidelines for reporting of race/ethnic groups in
clinical research. Latino ethnicity is defined as ““A person of
Cuban, Mexican, Puerto Rican, South or Central American, or
other Spanish culture or origin, regardless of race;” [18] Even
though ICECS is developed to improve these outcomes among
Latino American children, however the design strategy could be
applied to other demographic groups in future studies. It involves
developing and testing a bilingual family-based and culturally
sensitive educational intervention in an interactive comic-book
format. It is deployed on a portable device (touch-based tablet). By
targeting both Latino parents and their children simultaneously, this
intervention improves knowledge regarding healthy nutrition and
exercise and promotes parent-child communication, complements
the learning process and improves knowledge sharing. Similar
strategies could be applied to larger trials that can be replicated as a
relatively brief but targeted intervention incorporating low-cost
computer technology. In this exploratory study, patients in the
intervention group play the first chapter of ICECS during their
hospital visit, and then continue to complete additional two chapters
at home to enable them to advance their goals and missions by
exploring several cause and effect scenarios with parental assistance
and approval; this is facilitated by logging on to a designated
mobile-ready site providing the same underlying message regarding
obesity prevention.

4. METHODS
4.1 Needs Assessment Survey
The purpose of the Needs Assessment Survey was to develop a
web-based bilingual (English/Spanish) survey of Latino parent-child
dyads visiting an inner city hospital or clinic to assess their dietary
habits and exercise patterns. Although we had initially planned to
recruit 25 parents for the survey, the response that we had from the
parents, the ease and efficiency with which it was implemented
encouraged us to gather data on 102 parent/child dyads over a 14week period. We feel this strengthened the conclusions from our
survey and helped us better understand the dietary habits and
exercise patterns in our target population.

ICECS focuses on utilization of interactive comic-book style
storytelling technology to enhance knowledge regarding healthy
nutrition and benefits of instilling good eating habits and daily
exercise into obesity prevention. This educational intervention is
expected to motivate parents and children (teens) to adopt healthier
lifestyles.

Sample Inclusion Criteria (Patient/Parent):

The choice of a comic-book style storytelling with many forks and
joins in the narrative is specifically chosen since it is a novel
medium that is extremely popular among children and adolescents.
It is more likely to capture their attention than any other media and
can be easily designed for combined play with a parent, thus
encouraging shared learning. In ICECS a role-playing superhero
(i.e., a graphical representation of an individual within a virtual
space) is the central figure that the child controls and the story path
taken by the superhero is based on the actions/choices of the child.
The superhero acts as a guiding force with the central theme of
overcoming several obstacles and completing missions to rescue his
parents from an infamous villain. As the parent/child progresses
through the story, different scenarios are encountered and different
solutions are presented with favorable responses enabling the avatar



Patients of Latino ethnicity, 8 to 15 years of age who
register in the pediatric ED and patients who visit the
three Family Learning Centers (FLC) and are
accompanied by a parent/guardian who is 18 years or
older and able to communicate in English or Spanish



A patient must receive an Emergency Severity Index
(ESI) Version 4 score of 4/5 indicating non-urgent status
for recruitment in the pediatric emergency department
(ED). The ESI score is a commonly used method in
emergency departments in the US to stratify patients into
five groups from least to most urgent based on acuity and
resource needs [19].

based on a multiple story-line multiple ending narrative that was
dependent on the food and activity choices made by the child. The
plot was chosen to be simple and context sensitive. The main
character realizes that his/her parents have been kidnapped by an
evil villain and he/she now needs to transform into a superhero and
go on a rescue mission. As every superhero needs help from the
world around, you the player have to help the superhero complete
his/her mission. The superhero needs to eat healthy, eat balanced
and eat on time. The super hero also needs to perform the correct
exercises and activities to stay healthy. The narrative then breaks
several times during a day long mission to ask the child to assist the
superhero and make the appropriate choices. Depending on the
choices the player makes the story can have many different endings,
however only the healthy choices lead to a successful completion of
the mission. ICECS effectively employs rich narrative with
compelling endings to add replayability and test multiple scenarios
in a cause and effect setting. Over several iterations of interacting
with the story the player builds knowledge on what foods are
healthy and balanced and what activities promote physical activity.
Figure 2 shows the early morning breakfast narrative where the
player is recruited by the superhero to help prepare a balanced
breakfast.

Sample Exclusion criteria (Patient/Parent):


Medically unstable patients, patients with ESI score of 13 (life threatening medical/surgical condition).



Incarcerated patients or patients from juvenile detention
facilities.

Recruitment was done at the Pediatric Emergency Department
(PED, only non-urgent patients were included), Pediatric
Ambulatory Care Clinic (ACC), and the Family Learning Centers
(FLC). Information from this survey was used for intervention
development; key attributes (e.g. risk awareness, facilitators, belief,
barriers, acculturation and peer norms) were used to refine ICECS
scenarios making it culturally appropriate. The cross-sectional
survey was conducted over a 14-week period.
Prior to
implementation, pilot testing was conducted and the survey
optimized with active participation of parents, a registered dietician
who regularly consults in the FLC with parents and children advised
on survey revision and finalization. The final survey as presented
was approved (English/Spanish versions) for deployment by the
Institutional Review Board. The survey was deployed on a touch
screen tablet PC (in PED) and on a desktop PC (in ACC and FLC).
Figure 1 shows how the surveys were administered.

Figure 2. The breakfast storyline for the morning mission
The Child starts at the breakfast level in the hospital and upon
successful completion is given a code to play the remaining
storylines at home. Parents reward the child by giving them
meaningful real-world prizes as they complete the missions at home.
The prizes were funded as part of the grant from the National
Institutes of Health for this project. The prizes included a water
bottle, Frisbee and jump rope and drawstring backpack and were
given after conclusion of each eating and exercise activity pair.

4.3 Nutrition and Activity choice lists
ICECS is designed to help children and parents understand what
good food and lifestyle choices are, and how they can apply them to
their lives. It is designed with the intent that after completion, the
child should understand:

4.2 Storyboard development
For development of content specific to ICECS, a nutritional
specialist working in our patient community for the past several
years with valuable experience in conducting educational
workshops pertaining to healthy diet and nutrition targeted towards
the Latino population was recruited. The design of the story was

Ideas for exercise and healthy meals

Two master lists were developed by a nutritional specialist, the list
contained three foods when combined together were given a
remediation message and a score. The mission is marked to be
successful only if the combined score reached a particular threshold.
Four distinct narratives were developed based on the score obtained
with one of them leading to a successful mission. Table 1 shows a
snapshot of the nutrition master list while Table 2 shows the activity
master list. Both these lists were developed by working closely with
a nutritional specialist who has been working with Latino
adolescents. The tables show the different scores the player can get
in the first column (scores can range between 1 and 4), 1 always
indicates a winning score and the result will be a successful mission
and the child will progress to the next storyline in the comic book.
The child always selects three food groups to create a balanced meal
and three activities that are appropriate for the time of the day and
can easily be executed. The explanation provides remediation
message on the selected choices and their effect. The child then gets
a chance to replay by selecting new choices until a winning
combination is chosen.

4.4 Story Progression
Each mission has three primary states: story, gameplay, and
results. During the story state, the user will be shown a comic strip
that depicts the current segment of the story. Afterword, the user
will begin gameplay, during which the user will make decisions for
the superhero, ranging from what foods the hero should eat for
breakfast, to what activities the superhero should perform before
he/she leaves the house. Once the child has made his/her decisions,
see Figure 3, the story will manifest into a narrative based on their
actions (this is another story panel, not the results screen, where the
multiple narratives get forked). Note: if the user made good
decisions, the story will progress well; however, if poor decisions
were made, the superhero may have a hard time completing his/her
mission and have to repeat the previous stage. Lastly, the child will
be shown their results, see Figure 4, which informs the child which
of their choices were good, and which choices should have been
avoided. As shown in Figure 4, even though individually the
selected choices are healthy, together they do not constitute a
balanced meal.

If the child does well, in terms of making the right food and exercise
choices, he/she will be able to progress to the next chapter in the
story. Otherwise, he/she will retry the game (this time with different
choices than before) until the user chooses a winning combination.

5. RESULTS
5.1 Results of the Needs Assessment Survey:
A total of eighty-two responses were collected between December
2013-March 2014. Forty-four (53.6%) responses were from PED,
22 (26.9%) from the FLC and 16 (19.5%) were from the Pediatric
ACC. Majority (33%) of respondents were between 25-34 years and
72% were females. All participants were Hispanic (target
population). Most parents (41%) were less than high school
educated. Mother (83%) was the key person making food choices
for the family in most households. Most parents (81%) considered a
healthy body image to be “neither skinny nor fat”. Most (62%) were
aware that obesity was related to problems like low energy, low
self-esteem and poor social acceptance and almost all (98%) agreed
that it could lead to diseases like diabetes and heart problems.
Parents felt that they could help their children by: making healthy
food choices for them (78%), and eating healthy themselves (72%).
The main barriers to healthy eating included lack of full control over
their child’s diet (59%), time constraints (23%) and child’s own
food choices (31%). Lack of knowledge regarding healthy foods
was the least cited barrier. Food as a reward is not frequently used in
Hispanic households and in most Mexican American homes meals
are eaten sitting together around the table (85%). Majority (74%) of
those surveyed said that vegetables were included in at least 1-2
meals consumed. 47% said that they served juice or other sugary
drinks with their child’s meal at least a day. Ethnic Mexican
American food was also frequently served in most households
(41%, daily). Overwhelming majority (86%) of parents
acknowledged importance of physical activity for their children.
School based sports activities formed an important part of physical
activities. Lack of parental time (20%), environmental reasons
(38%) and safety of outdoor play areas (30%) were some the
reasons cited as barriers to play.

6. DISCUSSION

5.2 Results from Usability testing
Observations were made by a research assistant during the usability
test and Table 3 shows the problems and the measures taken to
correct them.

This is the first study where a bilingual videogame intervention was
tailored to a specific Latino ethnicity target population group and
the videogame was designed for both parent and child play. Our
pre-videogame assessment survey provided us with insights into the
dietary patterns and attitudes towards food and exercise that are

prevalent among Mexican American parents. Based on this
information and experience of our clinical research team, we tailor
made the videogame intervention using food choices that were
specific to this population. It is increasingly being realized that
chronic disease conditions that begin in childhood and factors
contributing towards it should be understood from a social and ecobio-developmental framework. In this conceptual framework, the
child is nested within the family microsystem, that thrives within the
community and a larger societal ecosystem Better understanding of
this ecosystem is necessary to devise interventions that impact the
overall health and well-being of the child.

final version of ICECS is now ready to go into clinical trial and

7. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK
We have presented a novel approach to designing a comic-book
style interactive intervention administered to parent/child dyads at a
pediatric emergency hospital and also at home with the aims of
improving nutritional and physical activity outcomes. This is the
first intervention to involve both parent and child to actively
participate and communicate while interacting with the story and the
missions developed. We have seen successful results in limited
focus group and usability testing stages and hope to report
comprehensive findings once a clinical trial involving 150
parent/child dyads is completed.

The goal of this research is to create an iOS based application,
primarily designed for iPads, for code blue events at the Mayo
Clinic Hospital. The application layout and functionality is
explained with the help of screenshots later in this the design
section following the related work section that describes other
efforts in this area. Next, the paper elaborates the development
procedures, followed by an explanation of how these methods are
reproducible for other paper to electronic conversions. Usability
testing of the interface along with the clickstream analysis is
included next section. Finally, the results of the evaluation of the
application with respect to user interface are presented, followed
by the discussion of results.

ABSTRACT
Data documentation from resuscitation events in hospitals, termed
‘code blue’ events, utilizes a paper form, which is institutionspecific. Problems with data capture and transcription exists, due
to the challenges of dynamic documentation of patient, event and
outcome variables as the code blue event unfolds. We hypothesize
that an electronic version of code blue real-time data capture
would lead to improved resuscitation data transcription, and
enable clinicians to address deficiencies in quality of care. To this
effect, we present the design of a tablet-based application and its
use by 20 nurses at the Mayo Clinic hospital. The results showed
that the nurses preferred the tablet application over the paper
based form. Furthermore, a qualitative survey showed the
clinicians perceived the electronic version to be more accurate and
efficient than paper-based documentation, both of which are
essential for an emergency code blue resuscitation procedure.

The paper concludes that the developed application is preferable
to the current paper-based form being used at Mayo Clinic and it
is likely be used at Mayo Clinic in the near future.

2. RELATED WORK AND BACKGROUND

Keywords

There has been considerable work done in building mobile
applications that provide better form and function than paper
based documentation procedures. In [2], it was found that nurses
lacked quality and precision while recording critical events during
fast paced code-blue resuscitations. A code blue is an emergency
code that indicates a patient facing cardiac arrest. Figure 1 shows
the correlation between time delay and chances of survival from
cardiac arrest [3]. A study [4] conducted by the Pritzker School of
Medicine found that tablet applications were easier to use than
paper document. In that study the average ease of use for tablet
applications was greater than 20% over paper based procedures.
Another study [5] by the North Shore University Health Research
Center, found that it was easier to predict the occurrence of codeblue events when there was proper documentation through
electronic medical records (EMR). A tablet application would be
able to naturally integrate into an EMR system as compared to a
paper based procedure.

1. INTRODUCTION
The American Heart Association recommended in 1997 the data
elements that should be collected from resuscitations in hospitals
[1]. Currently, data abstraction from resuscitation events in
hospitals, termed ‘code blue’ events, utilizes a paper form, which
is institution-specific. Problems with data capture and transcription
exists, due to the challenges of dynamic documentation of patient,
event and outcome variables as the code blue event unfolds. Often
key tasks performed or commands given are missed/ entered in
error. Oversight may be sub-optimal. This may lead to poor
quality metrics, putting patients and providers at risk and provide
potentially misleading picture of resuscitation outcomes due to
methodological shortcomings. We hypothesize that an electronic
version of code blue real-time data capture would lead to
improved resuscitation data transcription, and enable clinicians to
address deficiencies in quality of care.

There are two main applications that are commercially available in
the market for resuscitation. Both these applications have several
short comings and our approach aims to provide solutions to these.

Full Code Pro: The application has a limited set of tasks,
there is no place to document prior events, has difficulty
to switch between screens, does not cover non codeblue events and has multiple clocks that can make
recording confusing

2.

Resuscitate! CPR AED & Choking: The application
doesn’t have note taking ability and is more of a health
care assistant rather than document recording process.

There is the option to use paper to electronic conversion tools such
as Iron Mountain, Shoeboxed or Form Wizard, however these
tools do not easily integrate with EMR and there are several
disadvantages in terms of privacy, visibility, cost and
compatibility. There is a need to have a proper digital
documentation application for resuscitation and this forms the
motivation behind this research.

Figure 2. Mayo Clinic paper resuscitation document
As seen above, there is very little white space and overcrowding
of documentation, as all information has to be recorded on a single
sheet. Resuscitation central [8] identified four main problems with
using this document: incomplete recording of data, illegibile
recording of data, absent of team member names, use of different
clocks to enter times.
The application was designed using an iterative heuristic
evalutation process. The application was initially developed with
minimal input, heuristic evaluation was conducted with three
doctoral students in HCI, the changes were implemented and the
process was reported until it was deemed suitable for use by the
nurses. The three students uses all ten Neilson’s metrics and
assesed the application by providing the appropriate indicators.
The feedback was compiled into a set of software requirements at
each iterative cycle and the programming team performed the
necessary changes. The major design considerations with respect
to the ten usability metrics are illustrated below:
1.

Visibility of system status: All tabs that are used for
documentation are always visible to the user and the current
tab is highlighted.

The application has been designed taking into account the Nielson
Usability Heuristic Metrics. These metrics are general principles
for interaction design [6]. A detailed heuristic evaluation is
presented in [7], and the Nielsen’s Metrics have been elaborated
for better understanding of the design. Moreover, screenshots that
illustrate the design and screen flow of the application are also
included in this section. The aim of the application is to enable
resuscitation processes to be documented in a timely and accurate
way. Furthermore, we show how the design can be represented as
an effective choice from the Human Computer Interaction (HCI)
perspective. This approach is selected with the aim of creating a
responsive design that will allow nurses to accurately record data
in a timely manner for a code blue emergency procedure. The
tablet application is designed with the aim of reducing clinicians’
cognitive load, the amount of mental effort required to process
presented information, by automating common tasks that have to
be frequently accessed in a paper based documentation system.

2.

Match between system and real world: To give familiarity to
the application and improve acceptability with the target
users (nurses in cardiac arrests) the application UI and
graphic style was indicative of use in the cardiac emergency
department.

3.

User control and freedom: The application was designed to
keep data persistent and allowed users to switch between tabs
without loss of data.

4.

Consistency and standards: The entire application has a
standard look and feel and all tabs have same design
templates with same contrast, font and color schemes.

5.

Error prevention and recovery: The application allowed only
one input item to be active at any given point of time.
Dependencies between single choice answers was
programmed into the application, thereby reducing time and
input error.

3. METHODS
3.1 Design

6.

Minimizing memory load: All possible selections are
provided as a dropdown list and users do not need to recall
the right choice, rather recognize it from the list.

7.

Flexibility and efficiency: The application didn’t address this
metric and several ideas such as adding a search option for
specific information or tabs and a cheat menu for all actions
possible on a tab are being proposed for future work.

8.

Aesthetic and minimalist design: The application tries to
keep only the necessary information on the tabs and the

The goal of the application is to replace the paper based form that
is being currently used at The Mayo Clinic to document code blue
events. A part of the actual paper based form is shown in Figure 2.

creating transcripts. Major changes during usability testing were
performed to look and feel of the application and are listed below:

information is provided in a simplistic white backroad that
stays true to the paper based look.
Help option: Help is available at any time during the
application by clicking a button and an email is sent to the
developer with the current state of the application and the tab
of origin.

The background color was changed from blue to white
as it was less pleasing

2.

The stopwatch icon that showed the time lapsed was
made larger and bolder.

10. Documentation: Complete user manuals and interaction
flows were created for the target users.

3.

Comments were made available as a drop down list,
instead of being typed as the most comments that users
made ended up being part of a similar set of entries.

Figure 3 shows an example screen highlighting the team members
tab of this application.

After these above changes were incorporated, twenty nurses were
asked to use the application under simulated situations. Nurses
with vary level of competency and experience were recruited for
the testing. A survey was given to the nurses at the end of the test
to record their experience with the tablet application. The survey
followed guidelines from the software usability scale [9] and
adapted to the use in cardiac emergency with additional guidelines
provided by the Mayo clinic physician. The survey consisted of
ten questions that followed a Likert scale that varied between
strongly agree (SA), agree (A), neutral (N), disagree (D) and
strongly disagree (SD). Table 1 below shows the results of the
survey.

Two rounds of usability testing was performed with a dyad of
nurse and physician at the Mayo clinic. Real life resuscitation was
followed for a simulated (dummy) patient to test the
documentation process. The physician gave the nurse specific
resuscitation orders as they would give during an actual event. The
nurse performed the documentation using a tablet instead of the
paper form. Audio recordings of the process were analyzed by

3.2 Overcoming paper based shortcomings
The major challenges in paper based procedures as listed in [8]
were overcome by the design of the tablet application in the
following manner:
1. Overload of information: Multiple tabs provide an
elegant way to divide the information and remove
clutter.
2. Illegible handwritten data: Data is typed or selected and
is always legible.
3. Incomplete data: Application checks if all input boxes
have been completed and alerts the user.
4. Names of team members: Using a drop down list it is
easy to select the team members for the event.
5. Multiple clocks: Since the clocks are all synchronized
between the tablets, the issue of multiple times and
inconsistency is automatically prevented.
6. Slow pace: Since majority of information is via drop
down selection the nurses are able to keep pace with the
resuscitation.
7. Inaccurate: Accuracy is improved by have all the above
factors/impediments corrected via the tablet application.

However, not even a single user disagreed for question 8 which
stated, “It was easy to look at the timestamps of different
interventions post hoc/post data entry”. This is also an essential
part of the application. Users do not have to manage different
clocks, as the clock built into the application is handling
everything. Question 9 was a point of concern as 8 (40 Percent) of
the testers felt that there are too many data points on one screen.
This screen was identified as the hemodynamics tab and a cheat
menu was proposed which will further divide that screen into sub
sections. This has been included in future work as it is not a
critical issue for the current iteration.
The final question asked whether the users preferred the tablet
application over paper-based for the documentation. 15 (75
Percent) of the users agreed whereas 3 (15 Percent) remained
neutral. Two users disagreed, as they still preferred the paperbased documentation. These results show that an overwhelming
majority of the participating nurses preferred the electronic
version. To make this result more meaningful, it should be noted
that the testers have been using the paper-based version for years
whereas it was the first time they were using the developed
application. Despite this, a good majority preferred the tablet
application, showing a great future for the application.
To provide quantitative depth to the results as well as providing
additional measures from a usability standpoint, clickstream
analysis was performed. Clickstream analysis [10] is the process
of collecting, analyzing, and reporting aggregate data about which
pages users visit in what order - which are the result of the
succession of mouse clicks each user makes.
As part of their usability testing, the actions that the twenty nurses
performed on the tablet were logged into the database. Once the
nurses completed their survey, the logs were sent to a database.
The logs contain every click that the nurses performed with time
stamps. Using this data, the screen flow of the application can be
emulated, which provides the ordering of clicks that the users
performed. This data mainly provides a representation of the
user’s navigation through the application, and also demonstrates
their path before they abandoned a particular task. Furthermore,
after careful consultation with the emergency care physician at
Mayo Clinic, the team identified certain tasks as ‘critical’ for the
success of the application. These particular ‘critical’ tasks have
been listed in table 4 below. The completion rate, also given in the
table, shows the percentage of nurses who were able to complete
the task successfully. Using this data, the team came up with the
following click-stream analysis presented in Table 2 below.

4. DISCUSSION
The results from the survey also shows the percentage of users
who selected a given option. The total number of users was twenty
and 5 percent implies one tester. All the testers were nurses who
are the end users of the application when released.
For the first two questions in the survey, all the testers agreed that
the materials presented in the tablet were intuitive and the
messages and prompts displayed by the tool were understandable.
Only 1 out of 20 nurses disagreed in the third question as she felt
that it is not easy to move between screens. Interestingly, she was
the only who had never used a tablet before which might have led
to her judgement. 3 (15 Percent) of the testers felt that tasks took
longer to execute using tablet than expected. When probed further,
these subjects had very high expectations, which are not realistic
for an application that has to store data dynamically. They were
expecting all features on one screen, which is not possible for this
application as there considerable content and limited screen size.
Question 5 from the survey had a 100% positive response as no
user reported the tool crashing.
For questions 6 and 7, nineteen out of twenty users felt that the
tablet was easier to navigate and also to document critical events
compared to the paper-based version. This overwhelmingly
positive response from the testers augurs well for the future of the
application, as these two features are critical part of the
resuscitation process. The one person who disagreed to these
questions was the same tester who had never used a tablet before.
This brings out an interesting development that some basic tablet
or smartphone experience is needed to make best use of the
application. Alternatively, some form of training on using the
application and tablet can be provided for users with no prior
experience.

indicates that most of the users were able to complete the task

assigned to them. Moreover, a 100% completion rate also implies
that all twenty nurses were able to complete the task without
navigating to the wrong screen, or clicking the wrong buttons.
Additionally, the only task that has a completion rate of less than
90% is the submission of final report and the activity log. The
reason for the lower completion rate for this task is that users
usually navigate to the earlier tabs before they submit the report.
The users want to be sure that all the required information has
been filled out. Therefore, they navigate away from the ‘submit’
screen, which in turn leads to a lower completion rate.
Overall, the clickstream analysis provides quantitative depth to the
earlier usability testing by depicting that most of the critical tasks
were completed by majority of users with a high success rate.

5. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK
This tablet application was developed specifically for use at Mayo
Clinic. However, this application can be used in hospitals across
the world to document the resuscitation process. Another benefit
of this application is that it covers processes that are not code-blue
as well, which gives it greater generalizability for large-scale use.
Moreover, at present, there is no generalizable code-blue
application that is in large-scale use.

cardiac arrest among children and adults. Jama, 295(1), 5057.

The methods described in this paper can be used to develop more
electronic applications from paper-based documentations.
Furthermore, this process could have potentially massive
implications for the future as there are numerous paper-based
documentations existing in the medical field at present and
converting these documents into electric form could prove to be
vastly beneficial for the users. The methods discovered in this
paper can potentially be used for most of these conversions. In
addition to that, these overall methods can be applied to the nonmedical world as well. Basically, any paper-based form that needs
to be converted to an electronic form can benefit from this
research.
This paper addresses the problems with data capture, as it exists
during code blue events during emergency care. The team
developed a tablet application primarily designed for iPads that
improves transcription of resuscitation variables for patients who
undergo a code blue event. This application aims to replace the
conventional, paper-based resuscitation transcripts that nurses
currently use to an electronic form. It was observed that a high
quality electronic application was noted to be preferable to a
paper-based version. Usability testing of the electronic
resuscitation documentation application done at Mayo Clinic
corroborated that physicians and nurses strongly prefer the
electronic version of code blue resuscitation sheet.

The iPad application developed as part of this research meets the
basic standards required as it was tested based on the usability
principles covered in a heuristic evaluation. Moreover, a number

desire to use this application, and support the future work that
would involve synchronizing the application based-data with
Mayo Clinic’s patient database (electronic medical record) as well
as adding more functionality to the application.

ABSTRACT

1. INTRODUCTION

Socially Relevant Simulation Games (SRSG), a new medium
for social interaction, based on real-world skills and skill development, creates a single gaming framework that connects
both serious and casual players. Through a detailed case
study this paper presents a design process and framework
for SRSG, in the context of mixed-reality golf swing simulations. The SRSG, entitled ”World of Golf”, utilizes a realtime expert system to capture, analyze, and evaluate golf
swing metrics. The game combines swing data with players’ backgrounds, e.g., handicaps, to form individual proﬁles.
These proﬁles are then used to implement a golf simulation
game using artiﬁcially controlled agents who inherit the skill
levels of their corresponding human users. The simulation
and assessment modules provide the serious player with tools
to build golf skills while allowing casual players to engage
within a simulated social world. A framework that incorporates simulated golf competitions among these social agents
is presented and validated by comparing the usage statistics of 10 PGA Golf Management (PGM) students with 10
non-professional students.

Game developers distinguish between realistic simulations,
referred to as ”serious games”, and games intended to incorporate social networks and interaction, referred to as ”social
games”. Most game designs fall into one category or the
other. Consequently, each of these types of games tends to
be adopted by a speciﬁc target audience. Despite the separate game development processes this distinction has created, the possibility exists to make a game socially relevant
without losing the requirements of a simulation or serious
game. This paper presents a design process; example title,
the World of Golf; and in-depth case study, that eﬀectively
blends the two forms to create Socially Relevant Simulation
Games (SRSG).

BACKGROUND

2.1

Serious Games

Serious games serve to educate, rather than entertain.
Their primary purpose is to provide an interactive means by
which a knowledge domain can be transferred to the player
[9]. The audience for these games depends upon the subject matter present in the game. It consists of players who
wish to train or learn a speciﬁc skill set, including experts
and players who are already somewhat knowledgeable in the
subject matter presented in the game, and often a serious
game provides direct, visual means by which these players
can assess themselves [12]. Many simulation games can thus
be considered serious games[6].
Based on Moizer’s work, we deﬁne a ”serious game” as a
game that:
1) Is intended to educate or train the player.
2) Contains a direct (usually visual) means of assessing
skill or learning.
3) Employs a game interface which provides the above two
features.

Social Games

The goal of ”social gaming” is to incorporate, as seamlessly
as possible, the social interactions and networks which occur
in the real world in a virtual environment [11]. As such, the
audience for social games includes players who wish to socialize and interact within this virtual environment[1][3]. Social games may provide little beneﬁt for single-player gameplay, and some may not include single-player functionality
at all. Also, since the focus of a social game is on the social
interaction, the game itself becomes a platform to facilitate

this interaction [5], and thus the details of the game’s subject matter are considered less signiﬁcant. Facebook games
are a modern example of this gaming category [4].
We deﬁne a ”social game”, or a game which is ”socially
relevant”, as a game that:
1) Requires little or no knowledge about the game’s subject domain in order for a player to enjoy the game.
2) Employs an interface, central to enjoyment of the game,
that is designed to connect its player base through multiplayer gameplay.

Step 1: Design of a Simulation

In order to create an accurate simulation and to complete
the ﬁrst step of our design process, we begin by establishing metrics which can serve as criteria for assessment and
training. This process is critical for any simulation to be
considered ”serious”, and the amount and types of metrics
depend on the subject matter taught by the simulation.

4.1.1 Golf Swing Metrics

3. A DESIGN FRAMEWORK FOR SOCIALLY
RELEVANT SIMULATION GAMES

Figure 1: SRSG Design Flow Diagram
We have developed a framework for SRSG that includes a
three-step design and development process, focusing on the
design of the simulation, consistent interfaces for all users,
and social hooks.
Step 1. Simulation: In this step the development team
designs the simulation, or core serious game aspects, of the
SRSG in a manner that ensures that it realistically and convincingly models the level of skill and domain knowledge of
users.
Step 2. Consistent Interfaces: After completing Step 1,
the development team must translate elements of the interface that has been developed to provide a consistent interface
which is both informative and simple to understand for both
casual and expert players.
Step 3. Social Hooks: Expand the completed simulation
with social hooks and features to attract and entertain the
casual audience.
Using the same process, games which are currently simulations can be modiﬁed and expanded into social simulations
using steps 2 and 3. The design process is illustrated in
Figure 1.

In general, metrics for the ﬁrst step of the SRSG design
process should be chosen based on two requirements:
1) The metrics should be accurately measurable using the
chosen method of input.
2) The metrics combined should form an accurate assessment of a player’s skill level in the subject domain.
With these goals in mind, World of Golf’s game engine
uses ﬁve golf swing metrics to determine what to look for in
a player’s golf swing. They are as follows:
1. Club Speed - The vector representing the force acting
upon the ball at time of collision, vimpact, is directly affected by the speed of forward motion with which the player
swings [7].
2. Club Face - The angle of the club head’s face - open,
closed or square - aﬀects the direction of travel and curvature
of the shot [10].
3. Club Path - The path traveled by the club head during the swing inﬂuences direction of ﬂight. This inﬂuence
increases as club speed increases [8].
4. Centeredness at Contact - The distance travelled and
direction of a ball are both inﬂuenced by how close the ball
was to the club head’s “sweet spot”.
5. Angle of Approach - The steepness of the angle at which
the club head approaches the ball during the swing aﬀects
how far the ball travels and how curved its path becomes
[2].
These ﬁve metrics interact to form a near-precise measure
[8] of the ﬂight path of the ball after contact, and help World
of Golf satisfy the ﬁrst step of the social simulation design
process.

4.1.2

Swing Assessment

The next step is to design an interface which brings the
learning elements in the simulation to the player. In the general case, this includes both player input and feedback from
the simulation. By establishing this interface, we complete
step 1 of the design process. For this purpose, World of Golf
utilizes real-time capture of 3-axis data from the Wiimote’s
accelerometer. The user holds the accelerometer with the yaxis pointing downward toward the ball and the z-axis facing
in the direction opposite the shot. The x-axis represents the
displacement of the club handle toward or away from the
golfer.
The club then forms a “swing plane” which intersects a
“ground plane” to represent a club path, as indicated in Figure 2. Deviations from this plane by the club head result in
changes to the centeredness of contact, and a diﬀerent club
path results in a new swing plane altogether.

4. WORLD OF GOLF
To demonstrate the eﬃcacy of the SRSG design process
we employed it to create the World of Golf as a generalizable SRSG. It is a golf swing simulation that includes a
simple, yet powerful method for facilitating online social
gaming. We chose this subject domain because it includes
easily measurable metrics of skill and performance and is an
activity which facilitates social interaction among players.

4.2

Step 2: Design of an Interface

Having completed the ﬁrst step, we now arrive at the second part of the SRSG design process, the development of
a uniform interface which includes features targeting both
expert and casual audiences. In general, the interface for

a SRSG should be designed so that, while some elements
target expert audiences and some focus on casual audiences,
all elements are accessible, to a reasonable extent, by both
audiences.
The interface displays a set of bars which represent the
magnitude of movement of the golf club on the x, y, and z
axis, along with the numeric values themselves. The bars
are used as a form of visual feedback which is simplistic
enough for casual players to determine how powerful and
how steady their swing was, while at the same time providing
the raw numeric values for use by experts to determine where
improvement should be made in their swing. The goal of this
design strategy is to satisfy the requirements in step 2 of the
design process (to develop a uniform interface that engages
both targeted audiences).

ment performed by the software, the system was evaluated
by comparing proﬁle assessments of golf students against
those of non-golf students. The goal of the evaluation was
to ensure that the assessment rating scored by a golf player
is consistently higher than the rating scored by a player who
is a beginner or who does not play golf.

Step 3: Social Hooks and Attractive Features

The remaining task is to fulﬁll the requirement of a socially relevant game. Since at this point, we have already
developed a complete game, the goal is to expand the game
with social hooks and features which facilitate player interaction. In order to fulﬁll this third and ﬁnal step of the
SRSG design process, World of Golf includes a ”golf world”
module. This module was incorporated into the design to
allow players to get visual feedback on their performance
and skill level. Values for each metric are used to compose
a virtual golf player, an artiﬁcial agent whose play style and
swing depend directly upon these retrieved values.
This module serves as the social hook which connects
players, both casual and expert, to other players through
their avatars in the game world, creating interactions typical in a social network game [4]. When a casual player is
matched against an expert player, the system automatically
adjusts the performance requirements to keep the gameplay
balanced, allowing for a fair match despite the diﬀerence in
skill between the two players. This connection between the
two audience groups completes the ﬁnal step of the design
process, making the game enjoyable for both groups.

5.1

Procedure

The study was performed at a driving range of a PGA
Golf Management (PGM) program housed in a university.
10 PGM students and a control group of 10 non-PGM students anonymously participated in the evaluation. Each student was instructed to swing the Wii remote until he or she
was satisﬁed with the last swing. Each student also completed the questionnaire along with his or her swing and an
anonymous proﬁle was created for that student.
Students were scored on each of the ﬁve metrics (club
speed, club face, club path, centeredness at contact, angle
of approach) as well as on level of exposure to the sport and
level of potential. All students were given the same set of instructions and tested under the same condition. Number of
attempts varied, and only the last swing attempt was given a
score. The score represented the overall swing performance
for each student.

5.2

Results

For the questionnaire module, the responses of PGM students indicated both high levels of exposure and high potential. Worth noting is that none of the PGM students
tested scored below a “2” in exposure, as indicated in Figure 3. This indicates that the scaling on exposure should
be increased to account for professional players, as the soft-

5. EVALUATION
To demonstrate that World of Golf satisﬁes the requirements of the SRSG design process, we evaluate it as a simulation. While this evaluation is not a core part of the design
process, it is useful in ensuring that one has met the requirements of both gaming categories. Since the ”Golf World”
interface is yet to be complete, we leave the evaluation of
World of Golf as a social game for future work, and instead focus on the serious game elements of the prototype.
In order to determine the validity of the real-time assess-

ware in its current state did not diﬀerentiate well between
the students themselves. The range of exposure levels for
non-PGM students was slightly more evenly distributed, as
shown in Figure 4, though no non-PGM student scored a
“3” in exposure among those tested.
For the swing metrics, scores of PGM students tended
toward extremes, whereas those of non-PGM students varied
less. 5 indicates the averages of students tested in each of
these metrics for both PGM and non-PGM students. NonPGM averaged higher in speed, and their club faces were
more likely to be open club faces. They scored an average
of 2.1 in speed, beating the PGM students by 0.3, and 0.5
in club face, beating the PGM students by 0.2.
For centeredness, club angle, and club path, PGM students scored consistently better on average than non-PGM
students. In centeredness, PGM students scored 1.8 on average, 0.7 higher than that of the control group. In angle,
they averaged 2.1, beating the non-PGM testers by 0.3. In
club path they held an 0.3 point advantage as well, scoring
1.7 in comparison to 1.4 for non-PGM.

The authors would like to thank Geoﬀrey Huston, Assistant Coordinator of the PGA Golf Management Program at
Arizona State University, for dedicating his time and providing continued support in this project, and the PGM program
for their cooperation during the evaluation process.

5.3 Analysis
The advantage in speed and openness of club face in nonPGM students can be accounted for by the observation that
these students, most likely as a result of inexperience, focused on swinging the club with as much force as possible,
giving much less consideration to the accuracy of their swing
or the steadiness at the point of impact. The reasoning
might be that these students interpreted a “good” golf swing
as one with the greatest speed at impact with the ball. Their
grips on the Wii remote were less steady, causing the wrists
to rotate signiﬁcantly at impact and the club face to switch
often to an open position.
While PGM students scored lower in speed and club face
metrics, their swings were far more steady and precise on average. Based on similar reasoning, the PGM students would
focus less on putting force in their shot and tended to focus
more on maintaining proper shoulder, wrist and body positioning during the swing. This scored them almost an entire
point higher on average in centeredness and gave them approach angles and club path scores which indicated a more
experienced golf swing. Based on the scores output by the
software, PGM students performed better overall and indicated far higher levels of experience and potential, a result
which supports the validity of World of Gold as a simulation.

6. CONCLUSION
World of Golf demonstrates that through a framework for
SRSG that applies a three- step design process, it is possible
to create a game which satisﬁes the interests of both experts
and casual players, and do so without isolating the gameplay experience of the two groups. This design study applies
the SRSG design process to a physical simulation involving
motion detection and synthesis; however the design process
could theoretically be applied to any simulation whose subject matter involves some form of social interaction, using
the criteria and requirements described. In addition to providing a strategy for the development of new, socially-aware
simulations, the proposed design model encourages the expansion of pre-existing simulation games without modiﬁcation of the core elements, allowing them to engage a larger
audience.

Abstract—We present a novel game and virtual world based
application that is aimed at improving the physical activity
estimation skills of parents. It has been well established that lack
of proper estimation of preschool children’s activity levels may be
one of the main causes for childhood obesity. Childhood obesity
has several long term health effects ranging from cardio-vascular
disease to type II diabetes and obese preschool children are at
risk for later life. We have developed an application that caters
to both the parent and the child and uses a virtual garden as a
fledgling ecosystem controlled both by the parent and the child.
By using a low-cost activity monitoring device and combining the
data collected from the device with the estimation inputs from the
parent the ecosystem manifests into real life-like visualizations
that are updated on a daily basis. The goal of the design is
to promote a two way intervention: 1)provide parents with a
tool to daily estimate and monitor their child’s activity levels
and 2)motivate the child to achieve built in goals and keep the
ecosystem lively and flourishing. We believe that our design will
lead to improved outcomes in physical activity levels as well as
long term retention and reuse by the parents. In this paper we are
providing the design of the system and in future plan to present
the results of a pilot trial.

I NTRODUCTION

Young preschool children, once thought to be very active,
have become more sedentary over time, which has contributed
to the high prevalence of overweight/obesity of preschoolers
[1]–[4]. Regular physical activity (PA) in youth has been
associated with decreased abdominal circumference [5], lower
blood pressure [6], reduced mental health issues [7]–[9],
improved sleep, cardiovascular health and aerobic fitness [6],
increased lean muscle mass, and bone strength [10]. Sedentary
behavior and PA of youth have been found to track at a moderate level from early childhood into adolescence/adulthood
and to predict adolescent adiposity [11], [12], evidence also
suggests that the body mass index (BMI) of early schoolaged children can be significantly predicted by modifiable
behaviors (e.g., TV viewing, PA) of preschoolers [13], [14].
Furthermore, PA is associated with low levels of later-life
overweight and obesity [6], [15], and regular PA results in
a decreased adult risk of metabolic syndrome [16], [17], heart
disease, hypertension, type 2 diabetes and osteoporosis [18]
and plays a significant role in health promotion. Therefore,
identifying strategies to increase PA and decrease sedentariness
of preschool children is an important approach to preventing
childhood obesity.

A systematic review of obesity prevention programs with
children, 0-5 years, identified 11 studies that focused on
increasing child PA and decreasing sedentariness [19]; 7
measured PA by subjective parent report, 6 of which reported positive changes. PA was objectively measured using
accelerometry/pedometry, in 4 studies that were conducted
in preschool/childcare settings and demonstrated limited effectiveness on PA (frequent sedentary behavior and low PA
levels) [2], [19], [20]. This may be due to limited parental
involvement, which is essential in effective healthy lifestyle
interventions with preschool children [20] due to the vital role
parents play in facilitating sustainable behavior changes in
children [19], particularly in regards to PA [21], [22]. Because
the lack of parental involvement may have greatly limited
the success of previous programs, a home-based intervention
focused on family involvement that includes objectively measured PA may be one of the most effective PA promotion
intervention strategies with young children [23], [24]. The
game ”Make Your Garden Grow (MYGG)” targets parentchild interaction and focuses family conversation on healthy
PA in a fun way through the use of biobehavioral feedback
and parental building of PA estimation skills. The major
contribution of this paper is the design of a parent and child
intervention delivered via an interactive game based virtual
world that tackles several topics such as virtual environments,
game based learning and exercise and activity promotion.

PA in preschool-aged children also has been found to
significantly predict change in body mass index (BMI) of 6-8year-old children [1] and improves mental health outcomes [9].
Identifying methods to increase regular child PA in preschool
children is, therefore, critical in altering a childs behavioral
health risk profile [15], [25]. Targeting diet and PA in an
intervention makes it difficult to identify their individual
contribution to outcomes [26], [27]. Previous research suggests
that programs focused on either diet or PA showed a small,
positive impact on child BMI, but combined approaches did
not result in significant BMI change. By testing innovative
interventions separately, researchers can better understand their
independent contributions to outcomes before conducting a
multifaceted intervention trial [20]. Some investigators have
found that children, 4-5 years old, had significantly more
sedentary time and fewer minutes in light and moderate-tovigorous physical activity (MVPA) than children who are less

than 4 years [28]. Other researchers, however, have found that
1-4-year-old children had significantly less time in MVPA than
4-6-year-old children [29], [30]. With these findings in mind,
the design of MYGG has been targeted towards children aged
4-5.
Several game based approaches to promote physical activity and reducing sedentary time have been proposed. In [31] a
commercially popular game Dance Dance Revolution (DDR)
is used in participant’s homes to improve MVPA numbers
and [32] compared the use of active video games such as
DDR and Wii sports to treadmill walking and found 2-3 fold
increases in energy expenditure with active games. In [33]
it was found that even though exergaming can reduce screen
time and promote activity, it fades in comparison to activity by
playing real sports or activities. In essence the real application
of games would be to motivate and encourage real world
activity and be the drivers of this change. Such motivational
interventions that apply game based applications have been
successful in promoting healthy eating habits as shown in [34]
and [35]. Behavior change and how games can promote it to
improve health outcomes has been presented in [36]. Avatars
that provide meaning and inspire change in behavior has been
explored by many researchers [37]–[39] and representing step
count as avatars has been presented in [40]. In [41] the relation
between self-presence in the virtual world and actions in the
real world are presented. However very little has been done to
improve the effectiveness of the parent in estimating the child’s
PA levels. Avatars and virtual worlds offer a playground for
both the parent and child to facilitate discussion and achieve a
common goal. This research combines behavior change using
avatars with parent child facilitation and goal setting to provide
a platform to improve the MPVA levels for children aged 4-5.
III.

S IGNIFICANCE

Physical activity and sedentariness are important contributing behaviors associated with obesity and thus should be
targeted for intervention efforts. There is a wealth of empirical
evidence which suggests that obesity treatment interventions
have demonstrated limited effects to date and that emphasis
might be better placed on prevention interventions [42]. Furthermore, it has been noted that interventions that are implemented with young children and their parents may occur prior
to the development of deleterious health habits [43]. Preschool
children are greatly influenced by their home environment.
Research that has been conducted in childcare settings support
this perspective as they have demonstrated limited positive prevention effects to date. The primary aim of this group study is
to test the overall feasibility and acceptability of a novel parent
skill-building intervention, designed to increase activity levels
of 48 non-obese (less than 95th BMI percentile) preschoolaged children (4-5 years) and a parent/legal guardian. The
secondary aims are to (a) test the immediate and intermediate
(6 months following intervention) effects of this theoreticallybased, prevention intervention strategy on parental knowledge,
motivation, skill development and PA as they relate to the
physical health outcomes of preschool children, (b) obtain
information to refine this intervention strategy for use in
home settings, and (c) evaluate potential study limitations
and alternative strategies to inform and estimate effect size
to power a large-scale randomized controlled trial (RCT) in
a rigorous efficacy test comparing this activity encouraging

strategy with other available technologies designed to encourage activity in preschool-aged children. This paper presents the
first phase of this research, the design of MYGG that would
be installed in the home via a touch screen computer. MYGG
includes a computer generated depiction (i.e., an animation) of
a child’s physical activity level and a skills-building program
for parents, which will result in a parent’s ability to more
accurately assess how active their child is and work with their
child to become more active. Increased physical activity in
preschool children is associated with many positive health
benefits. Emphasis on regular physical activity at an early
age may affect healthy habit development, enhance a child’s
general health, and potentially alter later life weight gain.
IV.

D ESIGN M ETHODOLOGY

The design of MYGG builds on complementary theories and ideas from behavioral science, avatars, game design
and goal-setting. Developed by Fisher and Fisher [44] the
information, motivation, and behavior skills (IMB) model,
serves as the theoretical foundation for this design (Figure
1). It is an empirically supported, partially mediating model
in which information (e.g., for skills building) and motivation
(e.g., supported intentions to make healthy choices) result in
behavioral skills (e.g., parental skills to estimate and monitor
child’s PA) for initiating and maintaining preventive healthrelated behaviors (e.g., increased child PA). MYGG satisfies
the following design principles originating from the IMB
model:
•

Modeling: The true essence in deriving a successful
model, is the the ability of the model to be able
to relate to both the child and the parent in ways
that demonstrates ideal behaviors that can be easily
emulated. We have specifically chosen a garden as the
modeling construct to represent the four levels of PA
inspired from prior work in estimating PA by tempo
and intensity [45]. a) Inactive or no activity beyond
baseline activities of daily living. b) Low activity or
activity beyond baseline but fewer than 150 minutes (2
hours and 30 minutes) of moderate-intensity physical
activity a week or the equivalent amount (75 minutes,
or 1 hour and 15 minutes) of vigorous-intensity activity. c) Medium activity or 150 minutes to 300 (5
hours) minutes of moderate-intensity activity a week
(or 75 to 150 minutes of vigorous-intensity physical activity a week). d) High activity or more than
the equivalent of 300 minutes of moderate-intensity
physical activity a week. The garden consists of two
plants that are central to the ecosystem of flowers,

Fig. 2. Accumulated minutes of MVPA a. 15 minutes b. 30 minutes and c.
80 minutes

bees, insects, birds and if you are extremely active a
bear can be sighted as well. One plant represents the
estimated levels entered by the parent and the other
plant captures the real activity numbers coming from
a low-cost pedometer worn by the child. The plant
uses a procedural height/branch/leaf generator based
on a activity scale generated from the four PA levels.
Equation 1 shows the calculation of scale based on
the weekly percentages of lightly active, moderately
active and highly active levels represented by b,c, and
d. The equaltion is reposible for building the proper
visual representation for PA and was finalized after
several iterations with an obesity expert.
scale = (b ∗ 0.3) + (c ∗ 0.3) + (d ∗ 0.4)

(1)

•

Positive Reinforcement: A key aspect of several
games involves rewarding the player when ideal behavior is enacted, MYGG provides an ecosystem
that represents built in motivations for the child and
parent to keep it flourishing. These are a) Environment
changes (changes the look and feel of the surroundings, from gloomy over cast clouds, intermittent rain
and snow to sunny bright colorful worlds), b) Plant
posture and growth (changes from leafy, green and
flowering to dry and wilting), c) Garden ecosystem (
results in the number of bees, insects, bugs, birds and
other animals that have flocked around the garden)

•

Social support and skills building: The design is
heavily dependent on daily communication between
the parent and the child and provides an interface to
discuss strategies daily before dinner. Parents have the
opportunity to set or revise the PA goals, set or revise
the PA estimates and launch the game. The length of
the game can also be customized to weekly intervals.
Over continued use of the game we predict that parents
would be able to become accurate estimators of their
child’s PA and also be able to set effective goals that
are achievable over set periods of time.
V.

I MPLEMENTATION

In MYGG an animated representation of a plant will depict
the regularity and intensity of a childs PA (Figure 2). This
virtual garden scene will be visible for parents and children
on a touchscreen computer monitor provided to the families.
The software will differentiate between the intensities of PA; if
a child spends more time in sedentary-light PA, the plant will

Fig. 3.

The Fitbit accelerometer

not grow as rapidly as if he/she spends more time in MVPA.
Regularity of the PA will be interpreted by a change in the
virtual weather on the display (i.e., sunny, cloudy). Because
young children do not carry cell phones, we have designed
MYGG so that children wear a small Fitbit accelerometer
(Figure 3), which transmits the PA data to the provided computer screen. In MYGG’s garden scene, the plant will flourish
when the game interprets the accelerometer data (Figure 2).
In addition to the plant representing the childs actual activity
level, there will be a plant to represent the parents estimate
of the childs activity. Each days garden scene will build on
the previously saved scene to display an accumulated version
of the two plants. The display representing the childs PA will
be automatically updated when the child is within 30 feet of
the computer. To improve skill-building, parents are instructed
on what to observe and discuss daily about the changes in
the computerized display. As the parents become more aware
of the childs current PA level and the recommendations, they
become encouraged to add attainable virtual goals for their
child.
The perception parents have of their childs PA has been found
to be significantly different from reality. With the two levels of
display (actual and parental perception) appearing daily on the
computer screen, a parent may more appropriately align his or
her estimation of PA with the actual level and the age-specific
recommended PA level [46]. Aligning parent estimates of child
PA with the actual level may be key in strengthening a parents
ability to identify low levels of PA and effectively intervene.
A. Technology
The game was developed using the Microsoft XNA
framework [47] and C++ programming language. The
software development followed the Agile/Scrum [48]
development process. Python was used start and continuously
run an application script that would manage any power
outages or shut down of the game on the touchscreen.
The game communicates with the Fitbit using the OAuth
authentication [49] via wi-fi as direct access to the data on
the Fitbit is not available. The Fitbit was recently validated as
a reliable device to measure step counts in young adults [50].
All four PA levels are tracked by the Fitbit as distance units
and step counts. We convert these values and use Equation
1. to estimate the scale value used to animate and grow the
plant. Check-in by the child is performed on a 24 hour cycle
before dinner time. A transition based animation system is
used to animate the plant and the environment as new data
gets pushed to the game on a daily basis. Table 1. shows the

climate and other environment conditions of the game, it
doesnt not effect the garden’s growth. The MVPA numbers
influence the garden growth and the growth progression and
the subsequent ecosystem changes are depicted in Table 1.
Parent can then compare their environment and ecosystem
progress with those populated by the accelerometer data. Over
continued use of the application it is expected that parents
would become better estimators.

Goal setting interface

term childhood obesity prevention goals. In future, we will
be conducting real world testing with parents and children in
small focus groups and refine the intervention based on usability and other performance improvement metrics. Specifically
we will be measuring the baseline demographics, nutrition
information, motivation to be healthy, behavior improvement
and progress towards daily, weekly and monthly goals as well
as Body Mass Index (BMI), waist circumference and waist-toheight ratio at several stages of the intervention. We believe
that regular meetings with the parents and educating them
with the use of the interface and looking at the above metrics
will provide additional motivation and knowledge needed to
achieve their goals. MYGG will be further enhanced to have
an administrator panel, that will provide researchers access to
all the needed data sets and analysis and build those into the
application. Furthermore, we will concurrently be conducting
a validation study of the Fitbit using the previously validated
Actigraph accelerometer to establish the psychometrics of the
Fitbit for future use with young children.

B. Results
We have successfully completed the implementation of
our design and have tested it with 5 students and 2 obesity researchers. Figure 4. shows the complete ecosystem at
ideal MVPA numbers. The game always starts showing the
several possibilities and then transitions into the current state
to motivate and remind the child of the various goals and
achievements that are possible. Figure 5. shows the side by side
comparison of the two plants at the beginning of the game and
Figure 6. shows a simple goal-setting interface that the parents
use to estimate PA values before starting the game.

Abstract—An alternative to the traditional classroom structure
that has seen increased use in higher education is the flipped
classroom. Flipping the classroom switches when assignments
(e.g. homework) and knowledge transfer (e.g. lecture) occur.
Flipped classrooms are getting popular in secondary and postsecondary teaching institutions as evidenced by the marked
increase in the study, use, and application of the flipped pedagogy
as it applies to learning and retention. The majority of the
courses that have undergone this change use applied learning
strategies and include a significant “learning-by-doing”
component. The research in this area is skewed towards such
courses and in general there are many considerations that
educators ought to account for if they were to move to this form
of teaching. Introductory courses in computer programming can
appear to have all the elements needed to move to a flipped
environment; however, initial observations from our research
identify possible pitfalls with the assumption. In this work in
progress the authors discuss early results and observations of
implementing a flipped classroom to teach an introductory
programming course (CS1) to engineering, engineering
technology, and software engineering undergraduates.

INTRODUCTION

The ability to write and understand computer programs has
become an essential skill for engineers to learn. The increased
reliance on computer programming to address engineering
needs has rapidly increased the number of programming-based
courses required to receive any engineering degree. There has
been a trend towards trying out newer strategies to enhance
and improve how first and second year engineering students
understand the principles of programming. Among the many
strategies, the flipped classroom or inverted classroom [3, 4]
has gained use being applied heavily at various secondary and
post-secondary institutions.
The simplest form of a flipped classroom involves replacing
traditional in-class lectures with video tutorials that students
are expected to watch prior to class. The students are then
required to come prepared for class, which is spent solving
hands-on problems that are related to the video. Some variants
of the flipped classroom model have students completing
assignments, projects and homework in-class based on the
watched video lectures. Inspiration and rapid increase of using

the flipped classroom approach and many of its variants stem
from the emergence of massive open online courses (MOOCs)
[5], which have now been established around the world. This
movement was spearheaded by the MIT OpenCourseWare [6];
aimed specifically to provide learning and knowledge to
anyone who had a desire and motivation to gain new
knowledge. The emergence of MOOCs as a ready-to-use
learning platform and the popularity of the flipped classroom
model have had a combined effect that has led to a vast
migration of traditionally taught courses at many educational
institutions.
This work in progress is a first attempt at a thorough
evaluation regarding the effectiveness of the flipped classroom
approach, specifically how CS1 or introductory computer
programming is taught. Several authors have experimented
with flipped classrooms in order to teach computer
programming, but past assessments have focused on upper
division courses. Gehringer and Peddycord [1] share their
experience with using the flipped model to teach a junior level
computer architecture class. Mason, Shurman and Cook [2]
compare the effectiveness of a flipped classroom in an upper
division engineering course that emphasizes problem solving.
Both studies note that a major detractor of the flipped
classroom approach is the introduction of the model in later
years can be a difficult prospect for the student who has
already had two or more years of learning in the traditional
way. That leads to the current study, which will investigate the
following research questions:
1) Can a flipped classroom be an effective model for
teaching CS1 to first and second year students?
2) How does the flipped classroom impact student
computing self-efficacy?
3) What associated value do students have toward a
flipped classroom approach?
4) What variants of the flipped classroom approach
effectively help students learn?
This paper will present our preliminary findings with the
intention of shedding light on how a flipped classroom model
compares to a traditional lecture-style approach in an
introductory programming course.

II.

COURSE DESIGN

The course used in this preliminary study was taught to
students enrolled in engineering, engineering technology and
software engineering programs. The three sections of the
course were designed to be the first foray into learning a
programming environment. Two of the three sections
underwent the flipped model (experimental) with the third
section being taught using a traditional approach (control).
The course was structured in such a manner that one
experimental section used the flipped classroom model for the
first half of the semester and then switched to a traditional
approach after taking the midterm. The second experimental
section started out traditionally and switched to the flipped
approach after the midterm. The control section was
traditional throughout. Students were randomly enrolled into
any of these three sections.
The course content included an introduction to the Python
programming language and covered sequence, selection,
iteration, flow-control, branching, object creation and
manipulation, as is common to most CS1 courses [8]. The
hands-on activities for all the sections centered on creating
game-based algorithms using Python and the PYGAME
library [7]. PYGAME provided the instructors with the
necessary hooks needed to make the course hands-on. This
was intentionally chosen to transform the course with
considerably more applied learning elements. All in-class
assignments were game-based and the videos necessary for
solving the in-class assignments were specifically recorded to
achieve student success. A total of 22 videos were recorded;
11 were needed prior to the midterm. The final exam was
given after all the videos had been watched and all
assignments were completed. A total of ten assignments were
given to each student; five before the midterm and five after
the midterm. A student, depending on the section they were
enrolled in, either did the first five or the last five assignments
in-class. All students took the same midterm and final across
all the three sections.
III.

COURSES ASSESSMENT

The common assessments across the three sections were a
midterm and a final. Both were timed tests and contained a
finite number of problems specific to the course. In addition to
the common assessments, students were also given pre-post
surveys to identify computing self-efficacy [10] and associated
value toward the course.
A. Summative Assessment
The project evaluated the performance on assignments
between the students who were in the flipped model
classrooms with students who were in a traditional lecturebased classroom. Summative assessment included the
performance on: 1) assignments before taking the midterm, 2)
performance on assignments after taking the midterm, 3) the
midterm, and 4) the final. Table 1 shows these represented as
columns and the rows represent the instructional model that
was being applied prior to taking any of the column items. The
flipped row indicates the results from the experimental

sections when they were flipped. The traditional row indicates
the results for the experimental sections when they were
traditional. The control row represents the class that used a
traditional approach throughout the entire semester. Different
pre and post-midterm assignments were used in this course
explaining the absence of these scores in the table.

Our summative assessments suggest that the flipped model
produced higher average scores in the course. This was
consistent across both experimental sections eliminating any
possible group differences that may have resulted from the
randomized student placement. The control section had lower
scores in both the midterm and final in comparison to the
flipped sections.
B. Computing Self-Efficacy & Value Toward a Flipped
Classroom Approach
A pre and post computing self-efficacy survey was used to
evaluate any impact the flipped classroom model had on
student confidence [9]. The survey was administered to
students in both the experimental and control sections. An
overall analysis of students' computing self-efficacy from both
classes revealed an increase from pre (M = 53.3) and postscores (M = 71.8). A paired-samples t-test of the 39 students
confirmed this difference to be significant [t (38) = -3.459, p ≤
0.001].
A formative evaluation of value was conducted to measure
the students’ associated value towards the course and also
their attitude towards the flipped approach. Experimental
classes were asked questions pertaining to the flipped
classroom approach. Initial analysis revealed a lack of positive
value toward the flipped model.
A correlation analysis between computing self-efficacy and
students' perceptions of value toward the flipped classroom
model was shown to be not significant. This suggests that the
course improved computing self-efficacy, but that the flipped
classroom pedagogical approach was not likely to have been
the reasoning for this increase. There can be many factors that
could be the reason for the flipped classroom approach playing
a less important role in the mind of the students. The critical
reasoning suggested by the students as part of the open-ended
survey were:
1) Adapting to a flipped classroom approach from
traditional lecture is overwhelming.
2) Viewing long static videos can be boring.
3) A time-constrained setting to complete assignments can
be intimidating in the early stages of using this
approach.

IV.

CONCLUSIONS & FUTURE WORK

In this study we report initial findings from a mixedmethods based experimental course design aimed at evaluating
the flipped classroom model for teaching CS1. Our results
show that the flipped approach has promise in improving
student scores, but that students found this new approach to be
overwhelming and intimidating at times. We aim to formalize
our experimental method over the next two iterations of the
course in subsequent years. We will be performing a
longitudinal study during this period and collecting data from
these iterations. Our intention of this study is to completely
transform our CS1 courses to flipped classrooms.
The preliminary results presented were able to show that the
flipped classroom model positively impacted student scores.
Student computing self-efficacy also improved, but since the
flipped approach was not used for the entire duration of the
class, there is a chance for improper correlation between the
approach and self-efficacy. We plan to address by further
testing in the classroom.
We have early insights regarding the various approaches to
flipping a classroom. It is not completely clear at this juncture
whether all parts of the course need to be flipped. A change is
definitely required in the way the videos are recorded. The
approach of video taping long lectures taught by various
instructors could be negatively impacting students value
toward the flipped classroom model. Additionally, an
important unknown to investigate is how best to increase
students engagement levels with the videos.

Abstract
Heat map based data visualization and mining is an emerging area in game engine design and architecture. Employed by many state of the art game engines and popular
commercial games, this technology helps populate and collate player activity and behavior to better inform the system for further action. Simulation and serious games can
tremendously beneﬁt by applying heat map based visualization for the purposes of analyzing and tracking player
behavior. Heat maps are time varying texture maps that
represent a chosen activity over a certain grid at any particular interval of elapsed time. In this paper results of applying a real-time heat map data capture and generation
tool on two military simulations: 1) Ground-based combat
scenario and 2) Unmanned Aerial Vehicle sensor operator scenario is presented. The research showcases several
real-time visualization techniques developed into the simulation with the main goal of understanding participant behavior. Novice and expert data is populated as part of the
experiment to validate the effectiveness of our methods.

1.1 Related Work
Heat maps have been a key instrument employed by game
developers to understand and track player behaviors. Typically employed during the testing phase they have become
a useful tool to ﬁne-tune games and remove bottlenecks
originating from bad game mechanics and design decisions. Heat maps were employed in the original Halo [8]
game launched with the ﬁrst XBOX console, where they
provided a deep understanding of optimal weapon placement.
Heat maps can be used to visualize a large range of measured information, but one very common use is in mapping
user gaze with eye tracking technology. In a 2 dimensional
environment (such as a website or image) it is quite simple for overlaid heat maps to provide information on areas
users ﬁnd interesting as well as ignored areas. For added
effect, these 2D heat maps have also used the heat data
to affect image opacity to reveal visited areas and obscure
overlooked sections with either shadow or fog [6].
The use of heat maps for a three dimensional scenes introduces additional challenges. Stellmach, Nacke, and
Dachselt suggest that traditional 2D methods for using heat
maps would result in data loss when used on a 3D scene,
since multiple parts of the scene could project to the same
point in a 2D map [7]. Three methods were suggested to
overcome this challenge: Object-based maps accumulate
heat data per object and show each object in a single color.
Surface-based maps work in a similar way, but they accumulate heat data for every mesh polygon in the scene and
assign a single color to each face. Finally, the type of map
used in this paper is a projected heat map. This approach
uses a texture map and projects each point on the object’s
surface to it corresponding texture coordinates in order to
accumulate data onto a 2D texture map.
Heat maps have been used for quick visualization of data
in analytics since their inception. However, they have not
been widely used to facilitate streamlined training as is proposed in this paper. Similar methods for heat map compo-

Introduction

Recently, unmanned aerial systems (UAS’s) have been increasingly important for both government and commercial
applications such as intelligence gathering or map making.
However, unlike a traditional aircraft, a UAS is operated
by a team of people including pilots and sensor operators
who are remotely located, using an interface to control the
system that is similar to a video game. This can introduce
additional challenges to the UAS operator, but it also introduces an important opportunity to use tools, such as heat
map visualizations which have been used in the past to analyze video game play, in order to provide enhanced training
for UAS operators.
In this work we propose a novel use of heat-maps for training by comparing novice users to expert users in order to
learn where they differ, and how they evolve over time. The
proposed use of heat maps will allow trainers to understand

sition and analysis are used to study such things as crowd
motion analysis [3]. This study uses accumulated motion
heat maps to quickly identify regions of interest for further
analysis. Different sets of heat maps were used for different conditions and were accumulated over long runs [2].
Training analysis has also been studied using various
means, but none have fully taken advantage of the power
heat maps can bring to the ﬁeld. An example is a study that
compared novice and expert eye gaze patterns during a laparoscopic surgery simulation [4]. Similarly to our project,
this study tasked novice and expert surgeons to perform a
simulated surgery while various data points were collected.
This is where heat maps could have shown differences in
novice/expert gaze positions over time, much like the several heat maps that were populated in our project.

The colors are chosen so that portions of the scene that receive less attention appear blue, whereas the portions of the
scene that receive the most attention appear more red.

2.2 Heat Map Types
As a user navigates the simulation, our system automatically maintains different heat map visualizations on various aspects of their surveillance habits.
Positional: The simplest heat map is the positional map,
which records the UAS’s location relative to the simulated
environment in the ground plane. This heat map is not of
much signiﬁcance for the current project as the pilot is on
a rail or pre-programmed to follow a set path.
Pitch Angle: A group of heat maps provide views of the
the amount of time spent with UAS camera at various pitch
angles. Each heat map is populated by a different interval
of the pitch angle pitchi . Separating the pitch angle into
multiple maps improves the resolution quality of the data
and at the same time allows trainers to set calibrated intervals to gauge operator surveillance. Rather than writing
a single pixel value for each frame, pitch angle heat maps
store the camera’s viewing frustum projected onto the environment below.
Zoom/FOV: Another set of heat maps record the camera’s
zoom level f ovi . This is accomplished in a similar manner
that the pitch angle is stored where the zoom level is divided into strict intervals and the camera’s projected viewing frustum represents the UAS.
Eye Tracking - Environment: A single projected heat
map that provides a visualization of the locations most
viewed by the player using pupil gaze tracking information. Instead of updating the heat map for every pixel rendered to the screen, the updates are limited to pixels that
fall within a limited distance from the user’s gaze. This
provides a more speciﬁc view of the areas surveyed by the
player than the pitch or FOV heat maps can show.
Eye Tracking - Screen: In addition to heat-maps that track
which part of the 3D surface were visible, a single heat
map is kept that shows information on the player’s gaze
throughout the session. However, this map leaves the pupil
gaze location in screen space to determine where on the
screen the player is looking most often. This can be used
to show if the player is checking head’s up display (HUD)
elements frequently and how they scan the screen during
surveillance.

Organization

The remainder of this work is organized as follows: In section 2 we give a detailed description of the software architecture and technology developed to create several types of
heat maps. In section 3 we discuss how the heat maps are
used by the trainer to help improve training and understand
the data coming out of the heat maps. In section 4 we give
a complete breakdown of the software tools used to achieve
the various needs of the project and discuss the production
pipeline for developing a scenario. In section 5 we mainly
discuss the results of having novices and experts interact
with our UAS sensor operator scenario and the resulting
improvements in the training process. In section 6 we look
at future directions for the project and additional features
that are being planned to continue the effort.

2 Heat Map Performance Tracking Architecture
Our approach concentrates on enhancing the training
methodology for UAS camera operators by capturing
trainee performance over time in a number of various heat
maps. Furthermore, our system proposes keeping track of
a separate set of training data performed by a separate class
off users considered “expert”. We refer to this distinction
of expert heat maps as the oracle heat maps.

2.1

Heat Map Generation

Each heat map is stored as a 32 bit ﬂoating point raster
image hm(s,t) . After each frame is rendered, the texture
coordinates at each rendered pixel are identiﬁed and the
value stored in the heat map is incremented. The heat map
is updated with each frame, so that the value at each texel
is proportional to the amount of time that texel is visible.
If the user has an eye-tracker, then pixels that are rendered
on the screen but not included in the user’s gaze are not updated. In order to visualize the heat-map, a pseudo-color
image is generated from the recorded heat data, the scene
can be redrawn with the pseudo-color image as a texture.

2.3 Oracle Accumulation
For a given user, every successful simulation attempt outputs the above set of heat maps, set U as a unique attempt.
This is in contrast to the centralized oracle set, O, which
accumulates multiple simulation outputs. Instructors are
provided with a supplementary tool that allows them to
manage the oracle heat map set by adding results of a given
attempt to the existing oracle set. The heat-maps in the ora-

cle set are added together element-wise to produce a single
cumulative oracle heat-map, which can be converted to a
pseudo-color texture and rendered in a display alongside a
student’s heat-map.

Technology Breakdown

This project involved development of two software applications: 1) A simulation that can be installed on any Windows PC that ran for twenty minutes and can be repeated
several times to gain familiarity and improve the overall
score. Scoring was a combination of correct identiﬁcation
of suspicious activity along with appropriate tagging. Figure 1 shows the simulation and the tagging interface used
by the player. The square on the right corner represents the
hot spots that the simulation is going to visit and its current
location. The tagging menu is divided into four areas: IED
placement, individuals, groups and other. Each area has
several other sub choices to select from. 2) A viewer that
trainers can use to look at player heat maps at a group or
individual level that can further lead to improving certain
errors that trainees might be consistently repeating at an
individual or group level. Figure 2 shows the viewer tool
used for comparing expert and novice heat maps. The numbers 1-8 represent the toolbar, the heat map type, directory
to load the maps from, map navigation, cycle the novice
and expert maps together, deviation of the novice from expert, the heat map image and lastly the tagging stats.

Behavioral Tracking Architecture

In our UAS sensor operator scenario we modeled an area
that was a sixty square kilometer grid near Baghdad, Iraq.
We then developed a system that can easily drape building,
trees, landscape over GIS data and create a 3D representation of this world. We developed a simple system for
populating the scene with people and vehicles. This resulted in a rich and lively environment where we can embed many patterns of life situations for the sensor operator.
These patterns of life scenarios were populated by polling
domain experts in the United States military and collecting
information on what they look for in sensor camera data
feeds and what they consider to be suspicious. These patterns of life situations were translated into agent behaviors
and the world was programmed to exhibit these behaviors.
Since the training scenario was for sensor operators and not
pilots, the UAS was on a rail and the sensor operator had a
twenty minute cycle for surveying six hot spots in the area
and identify and tag suspicious behavior.
In order to collect meaningful training data, an adequate
training simulation must be concerned with not only the
characteristics of the pilot/operator pair but also the traits
of the accompanying environment and its occupants i. e.
civilians, vehicles, buildings, etc. To this end, we maintain a set of behaviors that can be assigned to a given entity. entity. Behaviors are deﬁned as small XML ﬁles and
are complimented by various skeletal animation sets. Behaviors are ﬁrst classiﬁed as one of two base types, either
non-suspicious or suspicious. Behaviors are further distinguished by the explicit action being performed by the
exhibitor, e. g. ”running a wire spool along the roadside”.
Additionally, multiple behaviors may be chained together
to add more realism. For instance, a suspicious person may
walk normally with a group of civilians, but then break
away to dig a hole for a roadside explosive device before
returning to a crowd.
During training, the operator is tasked with identifying individuals on the ground who are performing suspicious
acts. The trainee may tag individuals whom they believe
are performing sufﬁciently suspicious behaviors. Once selected, the user chooses a behavior from a list of suspicious and non-suspicious visual cues that the suspect in
question may be exhibiting. After a trainee has successfully completed the training simulation, their choices are
compared with the correct results to grade users on their
behavioral interpretation. While some users will have difﬁculty detecting certain behaviors, others may mark a nonsuspicious behavior as suspicious. This lightweight sys-

provide eye tracking data. Gaze tracker has a documented
accuracy of 89 percent which was more than sufﬁcient for
this project.

expert and novice maps.

5 Results and Analysis
The UAS scenario was tested by two sets of participants,
a group of four sensor operators working for the air force
(experts) and another group of 25 aviation undergraduate
students (novices). Both the groups played the game three
times and all their heat maps were accumulated and scores
averaged for comparison purposes. Figure 4 shows the difference in surveillance captured from various senor camera
angles between experts and novices. The colors indicate
how long the camera spent on a certain point and as the
time spent increases it transitions from blue to red. From
these maps we can tell where the player is positioning the
camera, for how long and at what angle. The expert heat
maps indicate that trained operators spend more time at a
high angle while scanning cities than novices. Experts also
spend very little time in low angle and only over important
areas while novices tend to spend more time at non critical
areas and at low angles.
Figure 5 shows the camera’v view at different zoom levels.
From these maps we can tell where the player is zooming
in and how long they spend at each zoom level. The UAS
camera should be zoomed in only when a suspicious activity has been spotted and the player needs to conﬁrm and tag
the activity. While the experts only zoom into the hot spots
and areas of interest, the novices are zoomed in at many
unimportant areas. Between cities and areas of interest the
player should be zoomed out to maintain a maximum view
of the terrain, however blank areas in the novice map show
that they do not follow this rule. Figure 3 shows where the
player is looking at the screen and if there were HUD elements then bloom spots should appear in those locations.

Conclusion and Future Work

We have presented our research in understanding how best
to use heat maps for improving training for applications
that rely heavily on multi function abilities of participants.
We speciﬁcally chose the two scenarios, so that we could
prototype and develop our methods in one and then apply
those methods in the other. The UAS sensor operator is
a multi function personnel who has to have a quick ramp
up in abilities to perform critical tasks. The methods developed under the project can easily be incorporated into
existing simulations and training systems. In future work
we will develop additional tools and visualizations that can
give immediate feedback to the trainees and guide their behavior on the ﬂy. We are also developing methods that require group collaboration and teamwork. In the UAS world
the pilot is not on a rail and is an integral part of tracking
and identiﬁcation of threats and we are hopeful to further
develop our application to accommodate these needs.

Abstract— In a traditional software engineering class,
students are typically engaged in theoretical lectures
followed by homework assignments or a project. Use of
hands-on training and laboratory activities using realworld projects is more likely to produce students with a
higher level of achievement and more confidence in the
course material. If every topic or technique introduced in
the course has a corresponding hands-on activity that
demonstrates an application or use of the concept in the
industry, students better understand the need for the
technique and the learning environment is more
interactive, engaging, and interesting to students. This
paper presents a project called ScrumTutor that aims at
providing an engaging learning experience of Scrum
Software development process through a web-based
Interactive tutorial. It is designed and developed for
undergraduate students in introductory Software
Engineering courses. This software tool introduces its
users to modern software engineering methodology used
these days in the software industry known as Agile
Software Development that includes the Scrum framework
for managing software projects or products.
Keywords— Software Engineering Education, Agile
Software Development, Scrum, Web-based interactive
tutorial.

INTRODUCTION

Software Engineering courses are perceived as dry and boring.
Traditional software engineering classes mostly consist of
theoretical lectures and that do not engage students actively
thereby resulting in students not learning key concepts [2, 5].
Therefore application of those key concepts in real-world
scenarios is important for student learning. One can gain more
knowledge and retain it only when (s)he is able to implement it
or use it in a project that they might work on. An interactive
tutorial designed to engage a user in active learning of software
engineering concepts is of value. The requirements of this
tutorial would be: i) introduce user to a course topic through
the tutorial; ii) provide information on all the basic concepts
and key terms of the topic; iii) allow users to practice what they
have learnt in a user-friendly and engaging manner.
The goal of this project is the design and implementation of
a web-based interactive game to teach Scrum framework for

managing software development. Interaction with the user is
divided in 3 significant phases where the user plays three
different roles in each phase. For example, in the Scrum
process there are multiple roles such as a product owner,
scrum master, developer, knowledge manager, etc. The first
phase is ‘Observation’; here the user will observe the Agile
process in action. The second phase is ‘Data collection’; here
the user will use the techniques observed in phase I and
contribute towards data collection part of the implementation
of the project. Finally the third phase is the ‘Development’
phase. Here the user performs a developer role on the team.
The user picks one of the available tasks for development and
implements it. The aim is to successfully implement all the
assigned tasks. After going through all three phases the student
would gain hands-on experience in executing a Scrum process.
The interactive tutorial covers all aspects of an Agile Scrum
process, describes the basic unit of Scrum called sprint,
describes a sprint cycle and its duration, and demonstrates how
a project is implemented in sprints.
This paper presents the prototype implementation of the
ScrumTutor as an interactive tutorial with 2 phases. In phase I
the user plays the role of an observer. The sprint is one weeklong and the tutorial depicts activities from day one to day five.
The tutorial involves four roles and uses a specific software
project that involves developing a website to manage music,
music albums, artists, and events using a Content Management
System such as Drupal [13]. The Scrum roles simulated in the
tutorial are a Product owner, a Scrum Master, and two team
members. In later phases of the tutorial the user gets involved
as a developer on the team. In the first phase, the team starts a
weekly sprint by discussing the product that they are going to
develop at a sprint Planning meeting led by the product owner.
Each day of the sprint, the team has a daily standup meeting to
discuss the tasks each member worked on yesterday, what they
are going to work on today and if they have any impediments
in completing their tasks. At midpoint during the weekly sprint,
the team also has a Scrum review meeting where they discuss
all the sprint tasks in detail, their status, and if any team
member needs help on any task. In phase II, the user plays the
role of a data collector and participates as one of the team
member. The user is involved in the process and daily Scrum
meetings where (s)he provides their status update and also
collects data required to handle certain testing tasks for the
team. The player gets involved in the project thereby gaining
better understanding of the Scrum process.

RELATED WORK

The use of simulation games for education has become quite
widespread in the last few years [2-4]. Most of the related
work have established and published results that students
found simulation games for education useful in learning and
helped students in being more engaged in class. Although
games have been used to teach various concepts in a number
of fields, there are very few games that teach concepts in
Software engineering. In this section we present related work
on simulation games for teaching software engineering and
other related literature that provided inspiration for the design
and implementation of ScrumTutor.
Researchers have worked on simulation games to
teach software engineering processes through an experimental
card game that highlights process issues that were not
sufficiently addressed in lectures and projects [5]. This game
uses physical cards to reinforce software engineering concepts
unlike ScrumTutor that is a web-based interactive tutorial.
SimSE [6] is another game-based software
engineering simulation environment that provides a number of
games to teach various software development lifecycle models
such as waterfall model, incremental model, rapid prototyping
model, rational unified process, and extreme programming
model. SimSE does not teach Agile software development that
is the most recent and popular model. ScrumTutor addresses
Agile processes and draws inspiration from SimSE that creates
a game scenario with an office background and team members
working in an office thereby simulating a real-world
environment. ScrumTutor has used this aspect in its design
and addresses the area of Scrum that has not been addressed in
SimSE.
Students were introduced to Software Engineering
Interview process through a decision-based computer game in
a study at Rowan University [7]. Students learnt about
interview process that is needed in requirements analysis
phase of software engineering life cycle. By playing the game
multiple times students realized that gathering facts before
design and implementation is important for the success of the
project. Based on this work, ScrumTutor was designed to
have multiple phases so that concepts can be reinforced to
students to make sure they attain a high level of
understanding.
Researchers have also used the concept of games for
teaching various management concepts such as Risk
management and knowledge management [8, 9]. They
assessed the effectiveness in meeting learning objectives and
their findings clearly demonstrated the advantage of a
simulation game.
Other related work includes evaluation of objectoriented design patterns in game development [10] and seniors
rehabilitation using video game technology [11]. These
projects are close to education through interactive tools and
games but are in other domains. We believe ScrumTutor will
be a useful tool to the Software Engineering Education
community and can be customized to teach several other Agile
Process concepts.

SCRUM TUTOR – DESIGN

The long-term goal of the project is to design Scrum Tutor as
a simulation game with game features such as engaging user
interaction, time factors, adjustability of player skill levels, replayability, scoring, multi-player, and providing score
statistics. The first version of ScrumTutor was designed with
this end goal in mind.
A. What is being taught and how?
The initial version of ScrumTutor provides hands-on practical
experience to students in a software engineering class.
Students learn Scrum process by engaging with this tool as an
observer and assimilating the flow of process and management
of software development. The tutorial takes its user through a
weeklong sprint with a Scrum team working on various
development activities distributed from day 1 to day 5. On day
1 the user observes the product owner describing the product
and the product backlog to the software team. The user is
introduced to various concepts such as the Scrum board that
displays the sprint backlog. User watches scrum task
allocation happening during a sprint planning meeting,
discussion of tasks and allocation among team members at the
scrum board, and discussion on status of various activities
through a daily standup meeting in front of the Scrum board.
The tutorial has a pre-defined simulated time assigned to each
day. When the pre-defined time for a day lapses, the user then
progresses to day 2 and observes a daily scrum meeting held
to discuss the activities of the team members performed on
that day and on previous day, to get the updates from the team,
and also discuss any impediment’s that a team member might
be facing. This process is repeated for the remainder of the
days. The user observes these daily standup meetings
happening at a fixed time everyday, example at 9:00am in the
morning. During the remainder of the day the user observes
the team working on their tasks in their cubicles and
interacting with each other. On day 4, a sprint review meeting
is held to discuss the progress made during the current sprint
and the team assesses if there is a need to make any changes to
their plan in order to successfully complete their tasks and
deliver the artifacts. In this simulation, the sprint review
meeting happens at around mid-point in the sprint at a fixed
time, example 11:00am on day 4.
In order to encourage active learning and engagement, as
the user is progressing from one day to the next, a number of
quiz-type questions are presented to the user to test their
understanding of the concepts. The user is allowed to process
to the next day only after answering these questions correctly.
If not, the user is redirected back to the previous step to
observe the process and understand it.
ScrumTutor is designed to have multiple phases so that
the user can more actively engage in the process and gain
hands-on experience as they are learning and getting better at
Scrum. This version of the tool is designed to have 2 phases.
Phase 1 is the observation phase that was presented so far.
Phase 2 is the data collection phase where the user is taken
through a new sprint with a new set of tasks in the sprint
backlog and the involvement of the user progressively

2013 International Conference on Advances in Computing, Communications and Informatics (ICACCI)

increases. The user is involved as one of the team members
participating in the meetings, providing inputs, and status
updates. Tasks are allocated to the user that has to be
completed for a successful completion of the sprint.
B. What product is being developed using the Scrum
framework in ScrumTutor?
This software tool is designed such that any project/product
can be used as an example and plugged in to demonstrate the
Scrum framework, sprints, and various activities. In this
version of the tool, the product being developed is a website to
manage music, music albums, artists, events, and venues. This
product is built using a Content Management System called
Drupal. An existing Software requirements specification and
product backlog of this product was used to demonstrate the
process in Scrum Tutor.

C. What technology is used for implementation?
The long-terms goals of ScrumTutor is to provide education

through a fun and engaging environment, provide the thrill of
playing a game, and provide most features of a good game.
With these end goals in mind, HTML and Javascript was
chosen for UI development, C#.NET was chosen as the
server-side technology and Visual Studio as the Integrated
Development Environment (IDE).
D. Scoring/tests
ScrumTutor has a scoring mechanism through intermediate
quizzes to motivate the user to do better, replay and revisit
concepts that were not well understood, and gain further
understanding of the process by playing subsequent phases of
the game. A user is allowed to progress to the next phase only
after they have received a certain minimum score. The
quizzes are provided throughout the system in two ways:
formative assessment presented to the user during a sprint
while the scrum activities are happening and summative
assessment presented to the user at the end of a sprint.
Successful completion of the summative assessment allows
the user to move on to the next phase (and next sprint of the
project). Table 1 shows sample formative and summative
assessment questions.

SCRUM TUTOR – IMPLEMENTATION

ScrumTutor was developed using C#.NET and the ModelView-Controller (MVC) architecture. Visual Studio 2010 was
used as the Integrated Development Environment (IDE), C#
.NET as the middleware and SQL Server 2008 R2 as the
database management system. User interface was designed
using HTML, JavaScript, and JQuery [12]. Technologies used,
database design and user interface design are further described
in the following sections.
A. Technologies
C#.NET is an object oriented programming language
developed by Microsoft; it is mostly implemented in the IDE
called Visual Studio, a product of Microsoft. Visual Studio
2010 was used as an IDE to write the functional code in C# to
access the database and the user interface.
SQL Server 2008 is a ‘Database Management System’
developed to allow definition, creation, querying, updating
and administrating an organized collection of data. SQL
Server Express 2008 R2 is the version used in this application
to maintain the assessment data, user scores, and business
logic data required for the simulation.
JavaScript is a client-side scripting language used to provide
interactions with the user. Client-side scripts can be written to
control, communicate and alter the content that needs to be
displayed.
JQuery, an open source software, is ‘a fast and concise
JavaScript library that simplifies HTML document traversals,
event handling, animations, and Ajax interactions for rapid
Web application development [12].
B. Database Design
The database of ScrumTutor consists of several tables to save

2013 International Conference on Advances in Computing, Communications and Informatics (ICACCI)

1887

application data, user profile information, user scores, and
statistics. The detailed database design is shown in Figure 3.
Some of the important tables are listed and briefly described
below:
• Registration – This table is used to store user login
information. When a student or faculty registers for the first
time their data is saved in this table.
• Roledetails – This table tracks roles of the scrum team.
• FormativeQuestions – This table is used to store all the
formative assessment questions that are presented to the
user at the end of every day in a sprint with the answer

SCRUM TUTOR – EVALUATION

ScrumTutor has been tested on multiple browsers like Mozilla
Firefox 19.0.2, Internet Explorer 10 and Google Chrome 26.0.
The functionality of the application was tested thoroughly to
ensure that an undergraduate student could go through the
complete tutorial without any issues. An evaluation study was
conducted at Arizona State University (ASU) to assess the
usefulness of the tool. Students from the Masters in Computer
Science Engineering program at ASU were surveyed prior to
their usage of ScrumTutor to assess their understanding of
Scrum. They were then allowed to use ScrumTutor and go
through phases 1 and 2 of the tutorial. A post-survey of these
same students was conducted after they used the tool and the
students were asked the same questions to assess improvement
in learning. Table 2 shows some of the questions on the preand post-survey. Unanimously, all of them felt that the tool
was useful, easy to follow and gave them a better
understanding of the Scrum process and the basic workflow
unit in Scrum called sprint. Many of them felt that going
through this tutorial provided them an industry perspective
and context of how this Software Engineering concept in used
in the industry on a project while working in teams. Some of
them said that they better understood the team dynamics and
various roles than earlier. Students also commented that they
felt this was an innovative and engaging pedagogical practice
for teaching software engineering processes.

ScrumTutor provides hands-on experience on Scrum
Framework to undergraduate students The interactive tutorial
has multiple learning phases, i.e., Observation and Data
Collection in this version and Development in the future
versions. An evaluation survey of students about this tool
provides preliminary results that using ScrumTutor enhanced
their knowledge of Scrum, provided hands-on training of
concepts learnt and provided a contextualized reinforcement
of Agile process via the music software product that was
managed and developed using ScrumTutor. Based on these
results we are confident that a full version of ScrumTutor that
is a game-based tool with multiple levels of learning through
phases will be a useful addition to the software engineering
classes. Future work on this project includes the
implementation of phase III where the user plays the role of a
‘team member’. The user gets to be part of the software team
and contributes as a developer. User picks a task and
implements it within the given timeframe of the sprint.
Furthermore, sprints can be customized based on the project
that is being implemented and managed. If the project is large,
a sprint can be anywhere from two to four weeks. A Mobile
app version of this game/tutorial for various platforms such as
Android, iOS, and Windows will be a great addition and is

likely to be adopted by a larger audience. A pilot study will be
conducted in introductory Software Engineering classes at
sophomore level at ASU. Data will be collected on the
usability of the tool, student learning outcomes, student
reflection of the tool and faculty reflection of the tool. Phase I
and II of the tool can be further improvised with game-like
features by adding more user interaction. HTML5 may be
used to provide a rich user interface.

ABSTRACT

1. INTRODUCTION

This paper presents the design of an mHealth application for
prevention and early intervention of childhood anxiety. The
application is based on REACH, a preventative-early intervention
protocol for childhood anxiety. This paper describes the
multidisciplinary design process, sharing lessons learned in
developing an effective mHealth application. This mHealth
application is unique due to participant age, preventive-early
intervention focus, and utilization of mobile technology in a
situated manner. A design process inspired by user-centered
leveraging key informant interviews was used to identify
application features, including game based strategies and an
animated motivational avatar. Validation was performed through
external review and a usability study performed with target end
users of the application. Results suggest overall satisfaction, ease
of use, and increased motivation.

Mobile health applications (mHealth apps) span a wide spectrum
of health-related issues and treatment approaches, such as health
monitoring (physiological or self-reported), protocol adherence
through reminder communications, and (psycho)education [15].
Interestingly, the ubiquitous and familiar nature of smartphone
devices creates the potential for mobile health (mHealth)
applications targeted to youth “at risk” for anxiety disorders or
meeting criteria for anxiety disorder diagnoses. In fact, mHealth
for anxiety disorders may be of unique importance because most
parents do not seek help for their anxious youth, effect sizes from
anxiety programs are generally modest and need to be potentiated,
and there is a pressing need for sustainable and streamlined
intervention efforts that have “real world” utility [2][3][13]. In
addition, targeting anxiety disorders is of public health
significance because these are among the most prevalent
psychiatric problems in children with rates ranging from 5% to
10% and as high as 25% in adolescents. Anxiety disorders also
cause significant impairment, typically fail to spontaneously
remit, and are prospectively linked to clinical depression and
problematic substance use for some youth [13].

Although the popularity of mHealth apps is exploding, few
lessons have been shared regarding the user experience design for
such innovations. Building on randomized control trial (RCTs)
studies and theory, this research focuses on the design process for
adapting aspects of an empirically informed child anxiety disorder
intervention to a smartphone platform. Thus, this work is
significant due to the domain (anxiety), the nature of the
intervention (preventative-early intervention), the use of an app to
increase protocol efficiency, and the integration of concepts from
innovative design technology (gaming, notifications, user
experience design) to improve outcomes.
Focusing on the anxiety protocol, it is important to note that
considerable strides have been made to develop evidence-based
treatment and prevention armamentaria targeting youth anxiety
with almost every protocol employing the same cognitive and
behavioral procedures (Fisak et al., 2011; Silverman et al., 2008) .

REACH for Success (REACH hereafter) is a school-based
cognitive-behavioral protocol designed for 4th and 5th graders for
the indicated prevention and early intervention of childhood
anxiety and related problems. REACH uses procedures found to
be efficacious in RCTs, including in our own 3 RCT [8][9][12];
however, there are several features that set REACH apart. Most
relevant to this paper is data suggesting that the classic design of
evidence-based prevention programs (including programs like
FRIENDS [1]) is simply not feasible or sustainable in schools
(e.g., there are too many sessions, sessions are too long, manuals
are too cumbersome and not organized for real worldimplementation, too much training is required, and preparation is
too time consuming). In contrast, REACH was created from our
evidence-based exposure-based cognitive-behavioral protocols as
a practical intervention that can build a foundation for sustainable
large-scale diffusion. That is, REACH was streamlined into 6
sessions (instead of the typical 12-15), each 20-30 minutes in
length (rather than the typical 60 to 90 minutes), and uses an easyto-follow manual (each session is condensed into one page front
and back while FRIENDS, for example, has an 89 page manual).
One concern with REACH, however, is that such a streamlined
protocol may result in a lower dosage of the active change
ingredients and fewer opportunities for youth to practice coping
skills because there are fewer sessions and less practitioner
feedback time. This concern is justified as a recent child anxiety
treatment study evaluating an 8 session adaptation of the 16 to 20
session Coping Cat program yielded lower youth response rates
suggesting that difficulty practicing the skills was a major
impediment to recovery [11].
A purpose of this research was to design an mHealth platform to
accompany the REACH 6 session school-based preventative early
intervention protocol. Specifically, the goal was to develop an
mHealth app that: (a) provides on-demand opportunities for skill
practice, (b) uses notifications relevant to skill practice to improve
compliance, (c) offers tools for personalizing and tailoring the
protocol, (d) increases opportunities for corrective feedback based
on user data amenable to creating personalized reports of youth
weekly practice and response, and (e) yields high user ratings
along core validated usability dimensions relevant to technology
innovation efforts. Herein, the REACH protocol, the app design
process, and the app implementation are described. Results from
an empirical study in a usability context are presented. To set
domain context, the face-to-face protocol is described followed by
a discussion on design, implementation, and usability.

2. THE REACH PROTOCOL
REACH for Personal and Academic Success is an indicated
prevention and early intervention program targeting anxiety
disorders and related problems in youth. The protocol is
administered in a group format (five to seven children per group).
Each session (S) in the manual is organized in terms of Overview,
Content (didactic, games), Review/Closing, and After the Session
(homework). Self-evaluation of emotion expressiveness is
embedded in every session. The protocol focuses on broad-based
exposure and problem solving skills, which have a wide reach for
the range of anxiety disorders targeted. Unique session content is
as follows. S1: Introduction (group name, rules, and
confidentiality), Learn about emotions, and Relaxation. S2-3:
Define worries, Learn cognitive self-control, and Practice
cognitive self-control (Worryheads game). S4: Define social skills
and Learn about conversation skills (starting and managing
conversations). Practice conversations (make-believe game). S5:
Learn about assertiveness and Practice assertiveness (stand-up!

game). S6: Learn to face situations and Engage in behavioral
exposures to mild-moderate anxiety-provoking situations. Core
skill acquisition and practice tools include the use of Daily
Diaries, Guided Relaxation, STOP acronym, and STIC acronym.
Relevant to the REACH app, Daily Diaries are used to facilitate
self-evaluation of emotion expressiveness. Youth self-monitor and
describe in writing the anxiety or fear provoking situations that
occurred during the week. Youth also rate using a 0-8 feelings
thermometer the severity of anxiety/fear associated with the
situation. Lastly, youth describe in writing thoughts that occurred
before/during/after the situation (e.g., worries) and actions that
resulted (e.g., avoidance behaviors). In terms of Guided
Relaxation, youth are provided with pre-recorded standardized
step-by-step procedures designed to improve self-regulation of
anxiety related physiological hyperarousal via breathing exercises,
muscle tension/release exercises, and imagery. When it comes to
cognitive self-control, a four-step coping plan is introduced via
the “STOP” acronym where S = Scared? T = Thoughts, O= Other
[thoughts], P = Praise. STOP is first practiced via the Worryheads
game by using pre-written emotionally ambiguous and anxiety
provoking scenarios along with an accompanying “worry
thought”. Youth are then asked to change the “worry thought” for
a more realistic and alternative solution to the scenario provided.
In the game, successful resolution of the worry thought results in
advances toward a common goal for each player (reaching the end
to win the game). Subsequently, with basic knowledge of STOP,
youth engage in prospectively applying the technique to situations
that emerge as anxiety or fear provoking for them during the
course of each week. Lastly, behavioral exposures are introduced
via STIC jobs (STIC = Show That I Can. STICs are provided in
the form of a pre-written or prepopulated Fear Hierarchies based
on modules from the Anxiety Disorders Interview Schedule for
Children where each avoidance behavior has been pre-populated
for the child as individual exposures.
The REACH protocol has been implemented using a paper-andpencil approach. The protocol, while effective, encountered some
common limitations in practice, notably protocol compliance.
Specifically, subjects did not practice skills between sessions or
were not diligent in recording practice activity and outcomes.
Further, as noted in section 1, lower dosage in the related Coping
Cat tool resulted in lower response rates. Data capture with paperand-pencil methods is also time consuming and subject to human
coding errors or oversights. The psychology researchers believed
mobile and gaming technologies could effectively address the
limitations, improve compliance and data capture, thereby
reducing dosage while increasing effectiveness. They teamed with
software engineering researchers to conduct a multidisciplinary
design and development process to construct the app.

3. DESIGN PROCESS
The multidisciplinary team embarked on a highly iterative design
process focused on the capabilities and context of end users. The
researchers aspired to use a user-centered design (UCD)
approach, but in practice the designers did not have direct access
to end users during the design process and as such relied on
subject matter experts (SMEs) as proxies. The SMEs were the
psychologists who developed the REACH protocol and had
deployed it 56 times to youth over 6 months. Section 5 describes
external validation via design review by a school advisory board
and a usability study with independent youth end users (n=22).

3.1 Gap Analysis
REACH is a pre-existing protocol, so the first design activity was
to review program materials and workflow, seeking opportunities
to effectively translate existing steps, and later innovating on
smartphone-specific solutions to achieve the domain objectives
for increased dosage, engagement, and feedback (see Section 1).
To better understand the domain of the app, the SMEs shared the
provider manual of the REACH protocol to the designers and the
materials for delivering the protocol (board games, handouts,
MP3s). The manual describes how the sessions, each conducted
consecutively over the course of six weeks, employ specific
practice worksheets, information gathering forms, and interactive
exercises designed to train youth in the preventive and coping
skills. The main activities defined in the manual were Daily Diary,
Relaxation, S.T.O.P, Worryheads board game, and STICs. Table 1
summarizes the protocol component steps and highlights
challenges in porting these steps to the mobile environment.

A round of stakeholder interviews involving the SMEs followed
the domain research of the REACH protocol. These included
working sessions between the design team leads and the SMEs,
visits by the SMEs to the design team’s lab, and synchronous
question-answer sessions over email and videoconferencing. This
step of the process addressed difficulties relating to understanding
the protocol and assumptions on both sides regarding
implementation objectives. This step took longer than expected,
with a result of inconsistent understanding of implementation
outcomes. The design team conducted an internal review to
identify root causes and come up with design process alternatives.
The causes identified included:
1. New terminology.
2. Gaps in understanding by the design team with respect to the
protocol.
3. Assumptions of the designers based on past implementations
of mHealth apps in non-preventative domains.
4. Ad hoc communications patterns between SMEs and the
design team, and within the design team itself.
5. A lack of understanding of the end user context.
Together, these issues are not uncommon in design processes, and
some were addressed (1, 3, 4) through simple awareness of the
issue in the team review. For example, improving ad hoc
communication patterns was improved through more frequent
design team meetings, clarifying the lines of communication with
SMEs, and reiterating design team understanding of requirements
back to the SMEs for validation.

Issues #2 and #5 were more significant. Issue #2 represents a
“blind spot” in design, due to factors such as missing information
implicitly understood by the SMEs but not apparent to the design
team. Issue #5 was a recognition that the design team did not
understand who would be using the app and in what context. At
this point the design team realized a more patient-centric approach
was required to overcome these design obstacles.

3.2 A Patient-centric Design Process
The design process described in the previous section focused on
translating a field manual; it is not surprising that the translation
had gaps derived from implicit knowledge assumed by the manual
authors and not understood by the designers. The software
engineering researchers suggested a more user-centric approach,
where the needs of the end user, in this case the patients, is the
focus of the design process. The gold standard for such a design
process is User-Centered Design (UCD), originally credited to
Norman and Draper [7]. UCD assumes a participatory design
process with end users, but for this research we prefer the more
inclusive definition of UCD as “the active involvement of users
for a clear understanding of user and task requirements, iterative
design and evaluation, and a multi-disciplinary approach.” [14].
ISO 9241-210 [4] identifies 6 principles to UCD (quote):
1. The design is based upon an explicit understanding of users,
tasks and environments.
2. Users are involved throughout design and development.
3. The design is driven and refined by user-centered evaluation.
4. The process is iterative.
5. The design addresses the whole user experience.
6. The design team includes multidisciplinary skills and
perspectives.
These principles were especially attractive to the design team due
to the uniqueness of the domain and protocol, and identified
issues understanding the end user context. The team realized the
app would not be a direct translation of the paper-based REACH
protocol, and needed to focus on context and end user experience.
There is a wide range of practices supporting UCD; the design
team utilized personas, prototyping with iterative feedback,
participatory design, and end user validation. The SMEs served
as participatory designers, eliminating the back-and-forth ad hoc
aspects of the initial process. They also served as proxies for the
end users during design as gaining access to youth (4th-5th grade
users for an extended time for intense design activities was not
possible). Access to end users would have certainly been
preferable during the design process but was not possible at the
time. However end user validation was emphasized before
approving the app for protocol trial; these results are reported in
section 5. Fortunately, prior domain research and SME interviews
from the gap analysis proved useful in the context of the UCD.

3.2.1 Personas
The design team started the UCD process by developing personas,
or proxies for categories of end users, and inviting the SMEs to
review them. The SMEs were not familiar with personas, and after
overcoming initial confusion about the technique, gained
enthusiasm and effectively provided useful feedback. The
personas shared with the SMEs are presented in Table 2.
Iterating over these personas led to several design insights that
were previously not understood by the design team. For example,
the design team came to understand subjects in this domain have a
higher need for re-assurance; respond well to attention and
approval, and are highly compliant (persona 2). Discussion of the

personas with the SMEs further revealed that in community
samples girls are more likely identified as “anxious” than boys,
and anxious youth fear the evaluative nature of social situations
(personas 3 and 4). After capturing a clearer idea about end user
context through discussing the personas created with the SME, the
design team started a phase of rapid prototyping to ensure the
SMEs provided frequent feedback on each design decision.
Table 2: REACH protocol components and gap analysis
Persona 1 Jacob is 10 years old, and is currently being raised by
his single mother. He was held back for behavior
problems as he tends to lash out when stressed. When
confronted with even minor change he shuts down,
and becomes irritable. His goal is to do as little as
possible, or just enough so he doesn't get in trouble.
Persona 2 Jessie is 9 years old and very shy. In larger groups of
10 or more people she panics, and is dangerously on
edge. She has a strong recognition of her symptoms,
and works very hard at overcoming them. Her goal is
to be free from required effort as soon as possible.
Persona 3 Mike is 12 years old. He finds it difficult interact in
groups. He thinks that everyone has prying eyes on
him and judging his every move. He loves to read
books and is distracted by day dreaming. He gets very
anxious and nervous in social situations.
Persona 4 Elizabeth is 10 years old. She is relatively overweight
and is embarrassed in evaluative situations. When her
classmates tease her, she cries and withdraws from
interacting with peers. This typically happens during
physical education and school games.

3.2.2 Rapid Prototyping
Rapid prototyping is an iterative design technique refining the
details of interaction models and overall user experience. Early
prototypes, or storyboards, focus on task sequences, or the
mapping of task workflows to interface screens. This leads to user
interaction modeling; the identification of user input actions
effecting transitions between screens or for the capture of critical
information. Later iterations refine these models and also layer in
thematic elements, until a final design is converged upon.
Iterations are meant to be short, frequent, and focused on
answering specific questions regarding the user experience.

3.2.2.1 Storyboarding and Clickthrough Prototypes
The design team used the freely available Pencil prototyping tool
to construct screen and clickthrough mockups. Clickthroughs take
simple screen mockups and overlay “hot regions” that advance the
mock to a new screen, simulating a user interaction. One
drawback is the tool runs its simulations in a web browser so tap
and swipe gestures are not supported; however, the tool does
support mobile UI “skins” to promote a look-and-feel consistent
with the mobile user experience. Figure 2 shows an example of an
early mockup created for S.T.O.P. activity.
The team created mockups of different scenarios in the app. Each
mockup was peer-reviewed within the design team, validated
against the documented protocol, and then presented to the SMEs
for feedback. The design was iteratively refined until the scenario
interactions were adequately captured, and the design team felt
comfortable moving to implementation on the Android platform.

Figure 1: S.T.O.P. Mockup in Pencil

3.2.2.2 Translating Protocol Components
As identified in the gap analysis (section 3.1), some protocol
components are a fairly straightforward translation, or port, to the
mobile app, while others are not. For example, the Relaxation
audio components were a straightforward port of the media to the
device wrapped with a simple consistent interaction metaphor. Of
course this component also requires the least user interaction of
any of the components. On the contrary, the Worryheads game is
a multiplayer board game involving cards. The app required
limiting the game experience to a single user compared to the
multiplayer board game. The design team replaced the physical
cards in the board game with preset “Situations” and “Thoughts”
screens. The user was then presented with a choice of four of
“Other Thoughts” options to choose from. Once the user selects a
choice from possible options a praise message was showed on the
screen to appreciate the correct answer. Screens depicting
Worryheads are shown in section 4.
A design concern in translating the protocol was the significant
amount of text a child is asked to input during activities such as
the Daily Diary and S.T.O.P. The mobile device is not suited for
textual input that goes beyond instant messaging or social media
apps, and further the end users are at an age where they are often
mobile-aware, but not proficient mobile typists. The fear was that
textual input would be skipped or significantly limited, or in the
worst-case cause frustration of the app to the extent children
would abandon it. The design team identified speech capture input
as a means to facilitate better information capture.

3.2.3 Injecting Innovations in the Mobile Experience
A challenge in applying mHealth concepts to existing clinical
protocols is the desire to innovate versus leveraging validated
protocol steps. For this project, the mobile platform provided the
means for increasing dosage by virtue of the device being everpresent. However, ubiquity is not enough, end users must be
motivated to practice the protocol. Engagement was addressed
through innovative features introduced in the mobile platform
including thematic and age-appropriate media, game strategies
(e.g. progressive reward incentives), and mobile notifications.

3.2.3.1 Designing an Appropriate Theme
A user interface theme refers to the consistent application of
stylistic elements such as images, fonts, audio or video media, and
user interface widgets (buttons, menus, taps, etc.). To gain
acceptance of the app amongst users familiar with the paper
protocol, the design team used the same theme used in the paper
protocol. The team ensured that color codes and the fonts used in
paper based protocol and the fonts used in the app are same. To

design the features of the app, the team studied the paper-based
versions of the activities to be performed by youth to get a better
idea of how to replicate the activities in the application. The team
followed the same nomenclature of the existing activities in the
screen designs reduce confusion and gain rapid acceptance.
The user experience required a gender-neutral, age-appropriate
proxy for the human guide who assists in the existing REACH
protocol. This proxy personifies the guide, providing instruction
and feedback to the end user through the mobile interface. Initial
ideas focused on themes such as “feed your pet” or “grow your
plant” but were rejected as being either too “babyish” for the
target age range or gender-biased.
The design team came up with the idea of an animated
motivational character in the form of a blob. The design team
referred to the character as “Bob the Blob” (Figure 3), but the
male name is never used in the app itself. Based on game design
concepts, “Bob” presents an age-appropriate, gender-neutral
proxy for protocol guidance and feedback [6][8].

3.2.3.2 Progressive Reward Incentives
While one of the goals of the REACH protocol is to empower
youth to be intrinsically motivated to enact the protocol, at the
training stage it is imperative to repeat the dosage faithfully in
order to attain this intrinsic motivation. A common gamification
technique is to employ leveled rewards as an extrinsic motivator
for performing a targeted behavior. Therefore a simple
progressive (leveled) set of rewards for extrinsic motivation
included in the app design. When an end user completes a task
from the REACH protocol they get a reward in the form of Bob’s
abilities/tricks. This way the user is motivated to follow the
protocol and completing the tasks (dosage) so s/he can unlock
more complicated tricks for Bob.
One concern SMEs raised during the design process was the
potential to inadvertently punish the child for not performing a
task. Given the domain, a design invariant was specified to keep
all interactions with the child positive; therefore, all language and
emotive expressions of Bob throughout the app were scrubbed to
ensure there were no negative connotations. For progressive
rewards, a setting in the app was designed to unlock new tricks
twice every week. The presence of these tricks also served as
extrinsic motivation for engagement.

3.2.3.3 Smartphone Notifications
Mobile platforms offer an “always on” communications channel
between service providers and end users. Most categories of
mHealth apps emphasize the communications channel between
clinicians and patients, or between patients and automated big
data platforms on the cloud. This project is unique in that it does
not leverage the mobile device as a communications channel. In
this generation of the app, the focus is on leveraging the device as
an information collector and dosage vehicle for the protocol. In
this sense the device serves more as a Personal Digital Assistant
(PDA) than as a connected mobile phone.
In this modality it is still important to present to the end user a
feeling of connectedness. The personification of Bob the Blob as a
proxy guide is one way the design provides this connectedness.
As a second design concept, the design team wanted to make use
of mobile notifications, but without relying on cloud-based push
notifications as these would require a persistent network
connection. Therefore the design supports local notifications
presented to the end user in both fixed and adaptive schedules.

Fixed schedules are daily time-based notifications, such as for the
Daily Diary, to complete a regular interval task. Adaptive
notifications require tracking end user interactions with the app
and dynamically determining whether to issue a notification to
engage with Bob the Blob again. The designers are concerned
with the notion of alarm fatigue through over-notification, though
currently the mobile device is given to the end users as a locked
down tool for practicing the protocol, and not as a generalpurpose smartphone for personal use.

3.2.3.4 Security and Privacy
Any mHealth app needs to be concerned with how user data is
stored, transmitted, and identified. These concerns can become
overbearing nonfunctional requirements on the app and down to
the underlying mobile operating system providing the
communication and storage services. At this stage of the app’s
development, it made more sense to de-identify data and work in a
locked-down, disconnected mode. There were several simplifying
assumptions the design team was able to make:
1. The emphasis on increased dosage over remote monitoring of
compliance or personal health measurements puts this project
in a different class of mHealth apps. Such apps push data to
remote providers (often via a cloud-based service) and
support human or automated communication reminders.
2. The relatively small number of participants in planned early
studies meant the devices, with a specific chosen version of
the mobile operating system, could be purchased and
distributed to end users. The design team selected a Motorola
phone running Android API version 19 (KitKat).
3. The relatively small number of participants makes it easier to
de-identify the data and manage it external to the app. A
secret user interaction combined with a password protects
access to functionality that supports exporting user
interaction and task completion data (see above).
Of course these assumptions will have to change in future
generations of the platform to facilitate broader adoption. But as a
dosage augmentation platform, the design team leveraged the
weekly visits with the psychologists combined with the
computational sophistication of modern smartphone platforms to
provide a self-contained solution.

4. APP IMPLEMENTATION
The Android platform was selected to support the app. The
openness of the Android platform, the availability of low-cost
devices, the ease of the Google Speech API, and the ability to
deploy the app without the involvement of an app store were the
deciding factors for the first generation of the app. This section
briefly describes the implementation on the Android platform.
The final user interaction model combined with scheduled
interactions per protocol rules is shown in Figure 2.
This timeline in Figure 2 is based on weeks one to six of the
REACH training program. Daily Diary, as the name suggests
needs to be made available daily for all the six weeks whereas the
Worryheads needs to be made available only in third, fourth and
fifth week of the training program.

When the user selects the app from the Android home screen, a
landing page is shown allowing the user to select from 5 available
activities (see Figure 3, upper left). At any time only activities that
are available can be selected from the landing page. Further,
activities that are overdue are highlighted by a soft gold pulsing
glow around the button (not shown) to provide a further visual cue
to the end user to perform an activity.
The S.T.I.C activity is shown in the upper right in Figure 3. In this
activity end users are encouraged to do a task they would
normally avoid due to their anxiety. In the paper protocol, once a
child completes the activity s/he receives a physical stamp from
an adult (usually a teacher or parent). In the app this was
implemented as a secret code entered by the adult, who could then
provide an electronic stamp of approval.

Figure 2: REACH App intervention Timeline

Landing page

S.T.I.C.

The S.T.O.P. activity (Figure 3, mid-left) asks the child to provide
responses to a set of questions (see section 2). Each response is
stored in a SQLite database on the device. Figure 3, mid-right
shows the “O” (Other Thoughts) step of the Worryheads game.
This is basically a variant of the S.T.O.P. activity with preselected “S” and “T”s. The child has to consider the given “S” and
“T” and select an appropriate “O” and “P” to complete the
simulation. At the conclusion of these activities Bob the Blob
praises the child (Figure 3, bottom right).
The Daily Diary (Figure 3, bottom left) is a scheduled activity
available to the child each day. The activity is available during
school hours but notifications are only given after school hours.
As described in section 2, the Daily Diary asks the child to reflect
on potentially anxiety-provoking events from her/his day, and
inquires about thoughts that came to mind in that situation. Youth
also rate how s/he handled and felt about the situation. This
embedded diary is part of the organizational framework of
REACH emphasizing the need to identify and confront anxietyprovoking situations that are threatening but manageable.
In addition to the 5 protocol activities available from the landing
page, the end user also can tap directly on Bob the Blob and be
taken to a table-oriented layout of “tricks” Bob can perform. The
tricks (animations) available at any time are based on the protocol
schedule as described in section 3.2.3.2.
Additional features were provided by the app to support research
outcomes (section 2). An on-device database stores all end user
responses, and tracks each user action. The latter will be used
after trials to answer research questions such as whether alarm
fatigue occurred, or end users were not sufficiently motivated to
engage with the app. A data export feature provided only to
interventionists allows data to be offloaded as csv files.

S.T.O.P.

Worryheads

Finally, in the face-to-face protocol trial, interventionists can
personalize dosage schedules or tailor training activities during
weekly visits. To support this in the app, a hidden feature was
embedded only for the interventionist role. A specific multi-tap
sequence combined with a secret PIN unlocks this feature so
interventionists can decide if a protocol component should be
enabled/disabled or otherwise modify the planned dosage for that
week. Additional settings include selecting the start date of the
protocol, notification time windows and frequency, the schedule
trick release, changing the teacher PIN, and exporting data.

5. VALIDATION

Figure 3: REACH App Interaction Screens

The highly iterative participatory design process described in
section 3 enabled continuous feedback during app evolution. After
completing the initial candidate release version, the design team
and psychologists conducted two types of external validation. The
first was two feedback sessions with external SMEs from a school

advisory board (SAB). The second was a usability study
conducted with actual youth end users in the schools.

5.1 Advisory Board Feedback
The SAB consisted of two school psychologists with experience
delivering REACH, and two school district administrators who
oversee student services and prevention efforts for 47 K-8
schools. Based on their experience with youth, the SAB
considered the developmental appropriateness of the design and
program tools included (e.g., during the face to face sessions,
youth wanted to utilize Relaxation and play Worryheads ondemand, so those activities were selected for inclusion in the app).
From the SAB feedback, three issues emerged:
1. Safety and security - would youth have access to texting and
Internet on the devices?
2. Cost: would parents be responsible for the devices, if lost?
3. Flexibility - would versions of the app be available for the
iPhone, smartboards, and tablets?
The first issue was addressed by adding security software
SureLock to every device. The second was addressed by applying
procedures used by the school relevant to laptop computers where
parents are financially responsible. For flexibility, it was
determined that preliminary data is necessary prior to investing in
additional versions of the technology for different devices.

5.2 Usability Study
5.2.1 Participants
With parental consent (and assent from child), 22 youth (Mean
age = 9.67 years, 12 girls, 12 Hispanic/Latino, 5 White, 1 Black, 1
Asian, 3 “other”) from public schools participated in the ‘system
usefulness, satisfaction, and ease’ aspect of this research. The
median household income was about $39,000 and most youth
were recruited from the same zip code and class grades. In
addition, 77% reported knowing how to use an Android
smartphone and 54.5% reported playing games using a
smartphone “all the time”.

5.2.2 Measures
System usefulness, satisfaction, and ease were assessed via 22items from the Usefulness, Satisfaction, and Ease of Use
Questionnaire [4] modified for children and adolescents. Youth
responded to each item using a 10-point rating scale (1= “not at
all” to 10 = “very much”). System ease of use (SYSUSE) was
measured via 11 items (e.g., it is easy to use; it is simple to use),
quality of support information (INFOQUAL) was measured via 3
items (e.g., instructions and messages are easy to understand;
messages to fix problems are clear), system ease of learning
(SYSEASE) was measured via 4 items (e.g., I easily remember
how to use it; I quickly became good at it), and system
satisfaction (SYSSATIS) was measured via 4 items (e.g., I am
happy with this app; I would tell a friend about this app).
Consistent with the original measure, alpha reliabilities were
excellent: system ease of use (α = 0.92), quality of support
information (α = 0.83), system ease of learning (α = 0.92), system
satisfaction (α = 0.88), and stigma (α = 0.81) scale scores, and
overall usability score (α = 0.95).

5.2.3 Procedures
Parents (primary caregivers, legal guardians) received a letter
from the research team describing the nature of the study and the
timeframe for participation (within the next 7 to 10 days). From
those contacted, 26% provided child consent and every child
provided assent (n=22). Youth with consent/assent provided data

at a university laboratory or at their school. At the beginning of
the study, each youth was provided with an envelope that
contained a device and a questionnaire. After receiving the study
materials, three phases (1-Listen to the Relaxation; play
Worryheads game; 2-Write a daily-dairy or S.T.O.P. entry; 3-Play
with the Blob) were implemented by trained research assistants.
For a phase, each prescribed interactions with the app was 2minutes and responding to the survey lasted about 5 minutes. At
the end, youth were thanked for their participation in the study,
which lasted a total of 20 to 30 minutes. Parents of participant
youth were provided with $15.00 at the end of the study.

5.2.4 Results
Descriptive statistics and correlations for the focal variables are
given in Table 3. There were no missing data and some variables
exceeded conventional cutoffs of |2| for skewness and |7| for
kurtosis [16]: System Ease of Use (-3.04 skewness, 10.39
kurtosis), System Ease of Learning (-2.15 skewness; 3.9 kurtosis),
and System Satisfaction (-2.23 skewness; 4.53 kurtosis).
Moreover, statistically significant Shapiro-Wilks test values were
found for these indicators and thus subsequent tests were
conducted via non-parametric approaches. Specifically,
Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney tests were conducted to estimate any
sex (boys vs. girls) or ethnicity/race (Hispanic/Latino vs. NonHispanic/Latino) variations in terms of: system ease of use,
quality of support information, system ease of learning, and
system satisfaction. No statistically significant mean differences
were found suggesting robustness across sex and ethnicity/race.

Given these findings, mean estimates for the total sample were
calculated and results showed that the REACH app system was
highly and positively rated, for the most part, along the four
dimensions of interest: system ease of use, quality of support
information, system ease of learning, and system satisfaction with
means ranging from 8.72 to 9.13. Also, as shown in Table 3,
statistically significant correlations were found among the four
dimensions with correlation coefficients ranging from .47 to .80
(p < .05). Lastly, transforming SUSE-Y overall total scores into a
traditional “grade” scale, analyses showed that the REACH app
system earned an “A” grade from 55% of youth, “A-” from 14%,
“B+” from 9%, “B” from 9%, and failing grades of “C-” or less
from 13% (or 3 youth). Focusing those youth who rated the
system with a “C-” grade or less, data showed that all three youth
reported no knowledge of Android operating system. One of the
three youth did not know how to connect the earbuds to the
phone, had trouble placing earbuds in his ears, asked what he is
supposed to press during the Worryheads, asked what the word
“respond” means, and did not know what to press during the
STOP task. Another seemed “lost” during Worryheads and the
third youth was distracted by SureLock pop-ups during testing.

6. DISCUSSION
Our multidisciplinary, collaborative efforts resulted in a
smartphone app to potentiate the prevention and early intervention
of childhood anxiety disorders and related problems. To our
knowledge this is the first research-based child anxiety prevention
and early intervention app with known usability ratings. The
FRIENDS for Life Program released an app for Android, but there
is no research relevant to the technology developed. In child
anxiety treatment, SmartCAT is a promising mhealth platform for
ecological momentary intervention, used as an adjunct to the
Coping Cat treatment program [11]. The REACH prevention app
appears to be more similar than different to SmartCAT whereas
the FRIENDS app is mostly psychoeducational. Focusing on
prevention, for example, REACH and FRIENDS provide ondemand opportunities for skill practice but REACH explicitly
focuses on reducing problematic anxiety at the indicated and early
intervention level as it includes focused and direct features
relevant to engaging youths in self-monitoring, in-vivo exposures,
and cognitive self-control. In addition, REACH is capable of
deploying notifications relevant to skill practice, offers tools for
personalizing and tailoring the protocol (e.g., increase
notifications, activate new tools based on performance, activate
tools parallel to the weekly focal module), and allows for
opportunities for corrective feedback based on user data amenable
to creating personalized reports of youth weekly practice and
response. When it comes to contrasting the SmartCAT treatment
app with the REACH prevention app, both yielded high “ease of
use” ratings. Moreover, as found in this research, the REACH
prevention app yielded overall high ratings along additional
dimensions not examined for FRIENDS or SmartCAT. That is,
REACH showed high ratings for quality of support information,
system ease of learning, and system satisfaction. Also, this
research found no significant differences between boys and girls
or between Hispanic/Latino and non-Hispanic/Latino youth on
any of the usability dimensions examined.
The REACH app appears promising and has the potential to study
questions not only relevant to potentiating program response and
refining aspects of the technology, but about large scale diffusion,
personalized care, and bridging the gap in health disparities when
it comes to affective problems and its related disease outcomes.
The version of the app described in this paper was designed and
created through a multidisciplinary process that is user-centered in
the broad interpretation of the process. Our subsequent plans for
the REACH app include incorporating patients, caregivers, and
interventionists directly into the design process, and broadening
its applicability to minority populations, populations with sleep
disorders, and studying the potential for positive remedies for
negative outcomes of anxiety, notably drug abuse.

Abstract—This paper presents the design, implementation
and evaluation of a hybrid clinic plus home based intervention
targeting Latino children to improve obesity outcomes. The
intervention applies motivational game based learning and
behavior change theories during design. Latino American
children are the main target group for this study as they have
signiﬁcantly high obesity rates due to socio-economic conditions
and lack of awareness. There have been several interventions
that have targeted game based strategies in the clinic to promote
health outcomes and some have even targeted obesity problems,
however to our knowledge this is the ﬁrst effort that adds an inhome component to the clinical intervention. We discuss in detail
the challenges faced while designing and implementing this
hybrid clinical trial. Finally, we present the evaluation results
from a randomized clinical trial that recruited 101 children.

I.

INTRODUCTION

This paper presents the results of the study conducted in
both clinic and home and titled Technology Based Obesity
Prevention Project (TeBOPP). For the purposes of this paper
we would refer to this study/project as TeBOPP. TeBOPP
involves developing and testing a bilingual family based and
culturally sensitive educational intervention in a video-game
format. It was deployed on a portable device and on computer.
By targeting both Latino parents and their children
simultaneously, this intervention aimed to improve knowledge
regarding healthy nutrition and exercise and promote parentchild communication, complement the learning process and
improve knowledge sharing. In this exploratory study,
children in the intervention group played the simulation
avatar-based game in the public hospital or clinic, and allowed
additional play opportunities at home to enable them to

978-1-5090-2210-6/16/$31.00 ©2016 IEEE

advance to the highest level in the game with parental
assistance and approval; this was facilitated by logging on to a
designated web-page providing the same underlying message
regarding healthy diet and exercise. The children in the control
group were provided with written materials and multimedia
that was accessible online on improving diet and exercise.
The TeBOPP study focuses on utilization of interactive
videogame technology to enhance knowledge regarding
healthy nutrition and benefits of instilling good eating habits
and daily exercise into obesity prevention. This educational
intervention is expected to motivate parents and children/teens
to adopt healthier lifestyles. A video-game based format was
chosen since it is a medium that is extremely popular among
children and adolescents. It is more likely to capture their
attention than other media and can be easily designed for
combined play with a parent, thus encouraging shared
learning.
The hypothesis that such an intervention will enhance
knowledge is based on recent studies that have explored how
avatars may influence individual behaviors cite. Researchers
at Stanford have started to explore a concept they have labeled
the Proteus Effect [11]. The Proteus Effect is a hypothesis
postulating that the behavior of an individual conforms to
implicit cues provided via a digital self-representation i.e.,
avatar [12]. For example, research suggests that if an
individual’s avatar is created to be taller, this individual acts
more confident during negotiation tasks [12]. In other
research, individuals that viewed an avatar of themselves
running on a treadmill were more likely to exercise than
randomized to a non-exercise condition [11]. Based on the
Proteus Effect, actions of an avatar, (particularly avatars
constructed to look like the individual), can act as a model for
an individual’s behavior. Previous research from social
learning theory has highlighted the power of modeling for

skill-building, behavior change, and shifts in self-identity [13].
In theory, an avatar may be a particularly powerful mechanism
to explore for promoting new skills, behaviors, and possibly
even self-perceptions and are keys for promoting positive
behavior change. TeBOPP combines the fundamental
principles of play therapy with cognitive behavioral therapy
and develops a video-game based intervention for creating a
change in knowledge and attitude among Latino children and
adolescents with respect to eating a healthy diet and regular
exercise for optimum future growth and development.
Prevalence of obesity among children and adolescents in
the United States continue to remain high at 17% but has
stabilized over the last decade. However obesity prevalence
among racial and ethnic minorities have continued to rise with
Hispanic children having a prevalence of 22.4%. In addition to
racial disparities among childhood obesity prevalence,
significant socioeconomic disparities also exist. Among
children whose adult household completed college, obesity
prevalence was approximately half of that of those whose
adult household did not complete high school [15].
II. RELATED WORK
The idea of using a game based intervention for improving
obesity outcomes is relatively novel. A behavior science
approach to designing a serious game for obesity and diabetes
is presented in [1]. A randomized clinical trial was conducted
based on video game play and changes in behavior towards
diet and physical activity was observed in [2]. In [3] a detailed
review of the potential of video games to tackle obesity is
presented. In [4, 5] the importance of story, immersion and
narrative to promote behavior change targeting obesity is
presented. Broadly games and visualizations have been used
to improve clinical outcomes in [6, 7, and 8]. Majority of
game based applications have targeted the caregiving side of
healthcare in areas such as training, surgery, triaging or
workflow. In [9] the research landscape for the use of
smartphone in improving health outcomes is presented. In [10]
a design of a virtual world to promote infant’s physical
activity estimation abilities is discussed. This paper provides a
comprehensive report on all aspects of conducting a
randomized control trial with a game-based intervention. It
looks at both the behavior change aspects as well as clinical
and home environments for running the intervention.
III. SIGNIFICANCE
Recent years have seen a sharp increase in obesity rates
among children and adolescents in the United States. The
National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey [15]
indicates that almost a quarter of preschoolers (2-5 years) and
one third of school age children and adolescents are obese or
over weight. There are also significant socio-economic and
racial disparities evident and Latino children seem to be
disproportionately affected by the current obesity epidemic;
38.6% of Latino girls are overweight or obese compared to
25.6% white girls, the rates are even more alarming at 42.9%
among 12-19 year old Latino boys cite. Childhood obesity has

been associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular
diseases and Type II Diabetes leading to significant long-term
morbidity [16]. Latino children in the United States are
currently at the highest risk for developing Type II Diabetes
when compared to their white counterparts [17]. Poverty
leading to lack of affordability and access to healthy food are
some of the major factors that account for high overweight
and obesity rates among Latino inner city children and
adolescents [18]. In addition, Latino children and adolescents
who are highly acculturated to an American lifestyle have
poor eating habits with greater dependence on fast food and
spend less time on exercise and physical activity [14].
IV. METHODS
The hypothesis for this study was that game-based avatars
(i.e., graphical representations of individuals within a virtual
space) could create change in knowledge and attitudes toward
healthy eating and exercise. The specific aims of the proposed
study were limited towards assessing change in knowledge
and attitudes towards diet and exercise as outlined below.
Change in weight or BMI as a result of this outcome was not
an aim of this study hence, weight, actual physical activity
was not measured.
1. Conducting a “pre-test assessment survey” among
Latino parents who have at least one child aged 8-15 years to
understand the socio-cultural factors (knowledge, attitudes,
barriers, facilitators, cultural beliefs, acculturation and peer
norms) that impact their children’s dietary habits and physical
activity.
2. Development of a bilingual, culturally sensitive
educational videogame intervention using an avatar about diet
and exercise for Latino children and adolescents, based on the
information drawn from the pre-test assessment survey.
3. Testing of the interactive portable tablet based
bilingual (English/Spanish) diet and exercise educational
videogame on parent-child dyads presenting to the pediatric
emergency department and any of the four Family Learning
Centers of an inner city tertiary care teaching hospital.
4. Assessing the impact of the educational intervention
by measuring changes in nutrition-related knowledge, parentchild communication, and attitudes toward adopting a
healthier lifestyle.
A.

Setting

TeBOPP is a prospective study that was conducted in the
pediatric emergency department (ED) at the Maricopa
Medical Center and the Family Learning Centers (FLCs)
adjacent to the outpatient clinics at Maricopa Integrated
Health System (MIHS), a large tertiary care public teaching
hospital and health care system located in Phoenix, AZ. The
combined FLCs had 28,000 visits in 2012 and roughly half of
these were children. Families use the FLCs while waiting for

appointments or to attend scheduled programs or just to visit.
The FLCs have been successfully used previously as a venue
for targeted patient health educational programs.
B.

Participants

Patients of Latino ethnicity, 8 to 15 years of age who
register in the pediatric ED and patients who visit the FLCs
and are accompanied by a parent/guardian who is 18 years or
older and able to communicate in English or Spanish were
recruited into the study. A patient must have received an
Emergency Severity Index (ESI) Version 3 score of 4/5
indicating non-urgent status for recruitment in the pediatric
ED. Additionally, the participants had to have internet access
at home to complete game levels. This study was done in an
inner city setting where majority of the children are of
Hispanic /Latino ethnicity. Of them, the overwhelming
majority are Mexican Americans. I another study previously
published by the authors that assessed access to care, unmet
health needs, perceived barriers to care, and compliance with
follow up care needs recruited a sample of 385 patients
families from the same population group; 91.7% of these
patient families were Hispanic, poor (67.8% families reported
household incomes less than 100% of the Federal Poverty
Level), and 80.8% used Spanish as their primary language at
home [23].
C.

Needs Assesment

A web-based, bilingual (English/Spanish) needs
assessment survey was developed to assess Latino parentchild dyads visiting an inner city public hospital/clinic. The
survey assessed their dietary habits and exercise patterns.
Although the proposal had initially planned to recruit 25
parents for the survey, the response from the parents, and the
ease and efficiency with which the survey was administered,
encouraged us to gather data on 102 parent/child dyads over a
14-week period. This strengthened the conclusions from our
survey and helped us better understand the dietary habits and
exercise patterns in the target population. Recruitment was
done at the Pediatric Emergency Department (PED), Pediatric
Ambulatory Care Clinic (ACC), and the Family Learning
Centers (FLCs). Information from this survey was used for
intervention development; key attributes (e.g. risk awareness,
facilitators, belief, barriers, acculturation and peer norms)
were used to refine video game scenarios making it culturally
appropriate. The cross-sectional survey was administered over
a 14-week period. Prior to implementation, pilot testing was
conducted and the survey optimized. The survey was deployed
on a touch screen tablet PC (in PED) and on desktop PCs (in
ACC and FLCs). The web based survey is currently available
at [20]. Detailed results from the survey are reported in [21].
D.

Game Development

For development of content specific to the videogame, a
nutritional specialist, who worked with this patient community
for the past several years with valuable experience in
conducting educational workshops pertaining to healthy diet

and nutrition targeted toward the Latino population, was
recruited. The design of the story was based on a multiple
story-line multiple ending narrative that was dependent on the
food and activity choices made by the child. The plot was
chosen to be simple and context sensitive. The main character
realizes that his/her parents have been kidnapped by an evil
villain and he/she now needs to transform into a superhero and
go on a rescue mission. As every superhero needs help from
the world around, the player needs to help the superhero
complete his/her mission. The superhero needs to eat healthy,
eat balanced and eat on-time. The super hero also needs to
perform the correct exercises and activities to stay healthy.
The narrative then breaks several times during a day long
mission to ask the child to assist the superhero and make the
appropriate choices. Depending on the choices the player
makes the story can have many different endings, however
only the healthy choices lead to a successful completion of the
mission. The game effectively employs rich narrative with
compelling endings to add replayability and test multiple
scenarios in a cause and effect setting. Over several iterations
of interacting with the story the player builds knowledge on
what foods are healthy and balanced and what activities
promote physical activity. Figure 1 shows the early morning
breakfast narrative where the superhero needs to eat a
balanced breakfast. The child starts at the breakfast level in
the hospital and upon successful completion is given a code to
play the remaining storylines at home. Parents reward the
child by giving them meaningful real-world prizes (e.g., water
bottle, Frisbee, jump rope, and back pack) as they complete
the missions at home.

Fig. 1. The breakfast storyline for the morning mission

The game is designed to help children and parents
understand what good food and lifestyle choices are, and how
they can apply them to their lives. It is designed with the
intent that after completion, the child should understand:
How to choose foods and make a balanced meal
(tailored to each meal – breakfast, lunch and dinner)
Which foods are healthy, and which foods / types of
foods to avoid
How to choose good alternatives to bad food choices

fit

The importance of eating well, and exercising to stay

How to incorporate exercise and fitness into their
everyday lives

TABLE I.

Once the child has made his/her decisions, see Figure 2, the
story will manifest into a narrative based on their actions (this
is another story panel, not the results screen, where the
multiple narratives get forked). Note: if the user made good
decisions, the story will progress well; however, if poor
decisions were made, the superhero may have a hard time
completing his/her mission and have to repeat the previous
stage.

Two master lists were developed by the nutritional
specialist. The lists contained three foods or three activities
that when combined together were given a remediation
message and a score. The mission is marked to be successful
only if the combined score reached a particular threshold. Four
distinct narratives were developed based on the score obtained
with one of them leading to a successful mission. Table 1
shows a snapshot of the nutrition and activity master lists. The
table show the different scores the player can get, 1 always
indicates a winning score and the result will be a successful
mission and the child will progress to the next storyline in the
comic book. The child always selects three food groups to
create a balanced meal and three activities that are appropriate
for the time of the day and can easily be executed. The
explanation provides remediation message on the selected
choices and their effect. The child then gets a chance to replay
by selecting new choices until a winning combination is
chosen.

Fig. 3. Results screen

Lastly, the child will be shown their results, see Figure 3,
which informs the child which of their choices were good, and
which choices should have been avoided. If the child does
well, in terms of making the right food and exercise choices,
he/she will be able to progress to the next chapter in the story.
Otherwise, he/she will retry the game (this time with different
choices than before) until the user chooses a winning
combination.
E.

Usability Testing

Usability testing to determine learnability and ease of use
was conducted and involved observations of actual children
and parents playing the videogame. The team reviewed the
results of the usability testing and analyzed user behavior.
Potential problems were identified and measures taken to
correct them were outlined as shown in Table 3. These
corrective measures required the team to go back to the
storyboard designers and the game programmers for
modifications. In addition, the translation team completed a
full review of the game post modifications to ensure accuracy.
This process ensured the game met the intervention targets.

During initial recruitment efforts, parent/child dyads that
had access to the internet via a tablet or computer were
identified for enrollment. When efforts to find parent/child
dyads that met this requirement were not being met, access to
the internet via a phone was also added as an option for home
play since the game could be played on a smart-phone. This
increased the number of participants eligible for the study.

Implementation

A research assistant collected basic demographic data
during the pre-intervention (T1) phase from both comparison
and intervention group enrolled. The parent/child dyad was
also assessed for internet availability at home so they could
continue play once they left the recruitment site. This was
needed to enable the game play at home. In addition a prequestionnaire was given containing the following:
A brief 7-item multiple-choice questionnaire to
assess baseline knowledge regarding the obesity prevention
will be administered to parents.
Question relating to parent-child communication
regarding need for adopting healthy diet and exercise.
Question regarding parent’s intent to adopt a
healthier life style for their child.
Eligible Parent/Child dyads would then
randomized to Intervention and Comparison groups

be

Intervention: Both the parent and their children will
then undergo an obesity prevention education
intervention aimed at improving knowledge and
attitude; this will be in a video-game format, in the
FLC’s parents and children will play the game on
desktop PC and ED patients on a portable tablet PC.
The parent/child dyad was then randomized to the
Intervention or Control Group. The Intervention
group played the Breakfast levels of the game while
the research assistant observed.
The game is
available to play at [19] and the login ID can be
chosen as any 2 alphabets followed by any 4
numbers.

Fig. 4. Consort flow diagram

The perceived value of the game to the parent was
assessed during the immediate post-intervention (T2) phase by
a simple satisfaction survey among the intervention group.
This satisfaction survey contained questions regarding
computer usability and interface. The intervention group was
given instructions to continue game play at home. The parent
was also provided the prizes to reward their child after the
Lunch and Dinner levels of play. Once all levels were played,
the same questionnaire was administered to assess immediate
post-videogame play knowledge change in the intervention
group. The Comparison (no-intervention group enrollees) was
provided printed education materials in English/Spanish
promoting healthy diet and exercise at discharge from the ED
or prior to their departure from the FLCs. See Figure 4 for
Consort Flow Diagram outlining recruitment. Two months
post initial recruitment (T3), the parent/child dyads from both
the intervention and control groups were contacted by the
research assistant. They were asked to complete the same
questionnaire used in T1 and T2.

V. RESULTS
A total of 436 children were assessed for eligibility and of
those, 335 were excluded. There were 212 that did not meet
inclusion criteria with the main reason being lack of internet
(74). Additionally, 123 declined to participate. Of those that
met eligibility criteria, 101 were randomized, with 51
allocated to the control group and 50 allocated to the
intervention group. All but two selected English to play the
game, despite that 50.7% said that Spanish was the primary
language spoken at home (Table 3). Of the 50 allocated to the
intervention group, eleven parent/child dyads completed at
least some game play at home. Of those eleven, four
completed all game play and three completed the
questionnaire at T2. Two participants did not complete the
initial game play with the research assistant. One was notated
as not being interested once game play started. The other did
not complete because the internet went down at the study site.
Follow-up for all 101 participants to complete the T3
questionnaire met with challenges. Of the 101 participants,
only three completed the two-month follow-up questionnaire,
two in the intervention group and one in the control group.

TABLE III.

An analysis to compare attributes of the intervention group
for those that played some part of the game at home to those
that played nothing at home was completed. The analysis
showed the groups were not different--not only statistically
but also based on general distribution of proportions. Figures
5-7 provide details on the attributes.

Observations made by the research assistant during
game play found that parent/child dyads played
well/quickly/without issues (23). Some of the parents had
trouble reading English (7) and a few patients also had trouble
reading (3). The satisfaction survey was given to parents after
the initial game play at the recruitment site. Figure 10 shows
the number of respondents by satisfaction level. The dark
green color indicates highest satisfaction to corresponding
question. Figure 8 shows satisfaction leve1 by percent of
respondents. Overall, parents were very satisfied with the
game play usability and knowledge being conveyed. Also,
most would have wanted to see opportunities to play the game
again at hospital visits.

addition, a letter was mailed to participants. Of the 101 that
enrolled in the study, the research assistant was able to speak
to the parent at least once in 60 parent/child dyads. The other
40 were either left voice mails or were never reached at
numbers provided. Despite contact, parents did not follow
through with taking the online post-questionnaire (T3) with
their child.

VI. CONCLUSIONS
This is the first study where a bilingual videogame
intervention was tailored to a specific Latino ethnicity target
population group and the videogame was designed for both
parent and child play. The pre-videogame assessment survey
provided insights into the dietary patterns and attitudes
towards food and exercise that are prevalent among Mexican
American parents. Based on this information and experience
of the clinical research team, the videogame was a tailor made
intervention using food choices that were specific to this
population. It is increasingly being realized that chronic
disease conditions that begin in childhood and factors
contributing towards it should be understood from a social and
eco-bio-developmental framework. In this conceptual
framework, the child is nested within the family micro-system,
that thrives within the community and a larger societal
ecosystem Better understanding of this ecosystem is necessary
to devise interventions that impact the overall health and wellbeing of the child.
This study met challenges with the aspect of families
completing the game at home. While the study identified
families that had internet access at home to complete the
game, very few actually did.
Even though the participants were given instructions to
login at home and given prizes to complete levels, they did not
follow through with it. It is unclear what barrier they faced. It
was also surprising all but two participants chose to play the
game in English when parents indicated that Spanish was the
primary language at home in 50.7% of the intervention group.
This indicates the child wanted to select to play the game in
English but the parents might have needed Spanish to be able
to work together on the game.
In addition, follow-ups for the two-month post recruitment
in this population were a challenge, for both the control and
intervention. Only three completed the T3 questionnaire. The
follow-up process included phone calls made at different times
of day and different days of the week, including weekends. In

In looking at lessons learned from this study, offering the
parent/child dyad the opportunity to play the entire game on
site would have increased completion. Any technology
barriers they may have faced going home would be removed.
On the satisfaction survey, most parents did state they would
like to replay the game in future visits. Perhaps supplied with
this knowledge, game play could continue at clinic visits using
the Family Learning Center to engage families in educational
game play. Also seeing how many were assessed for
eligibility with no access to internet, the Family Learning
Centers provide an avenue to gain access to computers.
