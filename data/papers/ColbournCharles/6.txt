Augmentation is an operation to increase the number of symbols in a covering array, without unnecessarily increasing the number of rows. For covering arrays of strength two, one type of augmentation forms a covering array on  vv  symbols from one on  v−1v−1  symbols together with  v−1v−1  covering arrays each on two symbols. A careful analysis of the structure of the optimal binary covering arrays underlies an augmentation operation that reduces the number of rows required. Consequently a number of covering array numbers are improved.
