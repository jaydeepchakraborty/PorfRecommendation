Given v, t, and m, does there exist a partial Steiner triple system of order v with t triples whose triples can be ordered so that any m consecutive triples are pairwise disjoint? Given v, t, and m1, m2, . . . , ms with  t=∑si=1mit=∑i=1smi  , does there exist a partial Steiner triple system with t triples whose triples can be partitioned into partial parallel classes of sizes m1, . . . , ms? An affirmative answer to the first question gives an affirmative answer to the second when mi ≤ m for each  i∈{1,2,…,s}i∈{1,2,…,s}  . These questions arise in the analysis of erasure codes for disk arrays and that of codes for unipolar communication, respectively. A complete solution for the first problem is given when m is at most  13(v−(9v)2/3)+O(v1/3)13(v−(9v)2/3)+O(v1/3)  .
