Abstract Coupled switched capacitance causes crosstalk in ultra deep submicron/nanometer
VLSI fabrication, which leads to power dissipation, delay faults, and logical malfunctions. We
present the first memoryless transition bus-encoding technique for power minimization, errorcorrection, and elimination of crosstalk simultaneously. To accomplish this, we generalize
balanced sampling plans avoiding adjacent units, which are widely used in the statistical
design of experiments. Optimal or asymptotically optimal constant weight codes eliminating
each kind of crosstalk are constructed.

1 Introduction
The ever-decreasing feature size of VLSI fabrication process has led to many challenges in
VLSI circuit design. One of the most important issues concerns the characteristics of onchip wires [11]. The wires’ cross-sectional areas and spacings have fallen dramatically with
the move into the ultra deep submicron/nanometer (UDSM) regime. This has increased the
resistance and capacitance of wires. To help reduce resistance, wires today are taller than
they are wide, and they are poised to grow even taller as technology continues to scale.
The resulting growth of side-to-side capacitance between long parallel wires causes coupled
switch capacitance to dominate the wire-to-substrate capacitance in UDSM circuits by several
orders of magnitude [21]. Coupled switched capacitance in turn leads to crosstalks, which
result in power dissipation, delay faults, and logical malfunctions. The problem of eliminating
or minimising crosstalks is considered the biggest signal integrity challenge for long on-chip
buses implemented in UDSM CMOS technology [12].
The worst crosstalk couplings have been classified into four types [6,12], as described in
Table 1. The coupled switched capacitance resulting from type-1, -2, -3, and -4 crosstalks is
in the ratio of 1:2:3:4. Hence, it is particularly important to avoid crosstalks of higher types.
Type-1 crosstalks cannot be avoided in any useful communication channel. However, type-1
crosstalks give rise to power dissipation and must be limited, because low power is a critical
design objective in recent years.
Another factor that has emerged as a new challenge for VLSI circuit designers is UDSM
noise, caused by high-leakage transistors, power-grid fluctuations, ground bounce, IR drops,
clock jitter, and electromagnetic radiation. The effects of such noise are difficult to predict
or prevent. For example, noise in radiation-hardened circuits for satellite communication
systems is random and does not correlate with particular switching patterns on the buses.
A further source of faults is manufacturing defects. In nanotechnology, circuits are manufactured with a significant proportion of faults, and occasional errors may be unavoidable.
Hence, preventive techniques are insufficient, and active error correction is required.
Various researchers have proposed coding techniques to encode data on a bus for crosstalk
avoidance [6,17,28], for low power dissipation [3,15,19,22,26], and for error correction
[1,8]. Coding schemes that simultaneously satisfy two of these three criteria have also been
investigated:
• crosstalk avoidance and low power dissipation [12,27];
• crosstalk avoidance and error correction [14]; and
• low power dissipation and error correction [2,16,18].

Despite many efforts, the only families of optimal codes known are those for low power
dissipation [3]. Many of the results on the comparative performance of existing codes are
based on simulations rather than rigorous mathematical analysis.
In this paper, we begin the study of codes for UDSM buses that simultaneously provide
for low power dissipation, crosstalk avoidance, and error correction. In particular, we exhibit
the first infinite families of such codes that are provably optimal.
The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 establishes necessary terminology and gives a
mathematical formulation of the problem of designing low-power codes that avoid crosstalks
and correct errors. In Sect. 3, we present the relation of codes of each type with packing
sampling plans avoiding adjacent units. In Sect. 4, we focus on optimal solutions for k = 3
for all positive integer n. In Sect. 5, the sizes of optimal codes of all types with small lengths
are determined by computer search, and brief conclusion is given.

2 Background
2.1 Coding framework
A coding framework for data buses was introduced by Ramprasad et al. [15]. A bus interconnecting two embedded systems on a systems-on-chip (SoC) platform can be modelled
generically as in Fig. 1. The source encoder (decoder) compresses (decompresses) the input
data so that the number of bits required in the representation of the source is minimised. While
the source encoder removes redundancy, the channel encoder adds redundancy to combat
errors that may arise due to noise in the bus.
Ramprasad et al. [15] considered various combinations of source-channel encoder-decoder
pairs and presented simulation results for their power dissipation. Their approach is what
is known as joint source-channel coding in the information theory literature. Shannon’s
information separation theorem [20] states that reliable transmission can be accomplished
by separate source and channel coding, where the source encoder and decoder need not take
into account the channel statistics and the channel encoder and decoder need not take into
account the source statistics. This applies, however, only for point-to-point transmissions
and for infinite sequence length. The first condition (point-to-point transmission) holds for
a UDSM bus but the second requirement for infinite sequence length is clearly undesirable
for bus coding, because it could give rise to circuits of unbounded delay. Moreover, joint
source-channel coding is useful only when we know the statistics of the source and channel.
In the absence of such statistics, one can only fall back on optimising the source and channel
separately. Indeed, Ramprasad et al. [15] considered coding schemes and simulations on
certain source data with better understood statistics (for example, pop music, classical music,
video, and speech).

In many systems, the behaviour of source data is hard to predict and so the joint sourcechannel coding approach loses its power. Many researchers have therefore fallen back on
addressing the source coding and channel coding problems separately. This is also the
approach taken in this paper. We focus on designing optimal channel coding schemes for the
scenario where the source statistics are unknown.

2.2 Codes
The Hamming n-space is the set H(n) = {0, 1}n , endowed with the (Hamming) distance
dH (·, ·) defined as follows: for u, v ∈ H(n), dH (u, v) is the number of positions where u and
v differ. The (Hamming) weight of a vector u ∈ H(n) is the number of positions in u with
nonzero value, and is denoted wH (u). The ith component of u is denoted ui . The support of
a vector u ∈ H(n), denoted supp(u), is the set {i : ui = 1}.
A (binary) code of length n is a subset C ⊆ H(n). C is said to be of constant weight w if
wH (u) = w for all u ∈ C . The elements of a code are called codewords and the size of a code
is the number of codewords it contains. The support of C is supp(C ) = {supp(u) : u ∈ C }. The
minimum distance of C is dmin (C ) = min{dH (u, v) : u, v ∈ C and u  = v}. A constant-weight
code of length n, minimum distance d, and weight w is denoted as an (n, d, w) code.
A code that is capable of correcting any occurrence of e or fewer symbol errors is said to
be e-error-correcting. A code C is e-error-correcting if and only if dmin (C ) ≥ 2e + 1 [9].

2.3 Set systems and graphs
For integers i < j, the set {i, i + 1, . . . , j} is abbreviated as [i, j]. We further abbreviate
[1, j] to [ j]. For a finite set X and k ≤ |X |, we define
 
X
X
2 = {B : B ⊆ X }, and
= {B ⊆ X : |B| = k}.
k
A set system is a pair S = (X, B), where X is a finite set of points and B ⊆ 2 X . The
elements of B are called blocks. The order of S is the number of points, |X |, and the size
 of
S is the number of blocks, |B|. A set system (X, B) is said to be k-uniform if B ⊆ Xk . A
graph is a 2-uniform set system and it is common to refer to the points and blocks of a graph
as vertices and edges, respectively. A path of length n is an alternating sequence of vertices
and edges W = v0 , e1 , v1 , e2 , . . . , en , vn , such that all the vertices vi , i ∈ [0, n] and edges
ei , i ∈ [n] are all distinct from one another, except possibly the first and last vertices. A cycle
is a path in which the first and last vertices are the same.
Let (X, B) be a set system of order n. The incidence vector of a block B ∈ B is the vector
ι(B) ∈ H(n) such that

1, if i ∈ B
ι(B)i =
0, otherwise.
There is a natural correspondence between the Hamming n-space and the complete set system
(X, 2 X ): the positions of vectors in H(n) correspond to points in X , a vector u ∈ H(n)
corresponds to the block supp(u), and dH (u, v) = |(supp(u)\supp(v))∪(supp(v)\supp(u))|.
From this, it follows that there is a bijection between the set of all codes of length n and the
set of all set systems of order n.
An (n, k,
is a k-uniform set system (X, B) with |X | = n such that every

 λ)-packing
element of X2 is contained in at most λ blocks of B. Let D(n, k, λ) denote the largest size
among all (n, k, λ)-packings. The leave graph of (X, B) is the multigraph (X, E), where E

123

Optimal low-power coding for crosstalk avoidance

483

 
contains each e ∈ X2 exactly λ − d(e) times, where d(e) is the number of blocks containing
e. When λ = 1, we omit λ in the notation; in this case, the leave is a simple graph. When the
leave contains no edges, the packing is a balanced incomplete block design.
The balanced sampling plan avoiding adjacent units (BSA) was introduced to design
sampling plans that exclude contiguous units in statistical experiments [10,25]; for more
recent work, see [7,29]. In statistical applications, in a circular or linear order of the elements,
elements that are “close” do not appear together, while those more distant all appear the same
number of times together. A (circular) BSAλ (n, k; α) is an (n, k, λ)-packing (X, B) with X =
Zn whose leave graph consists of all the edges {i, j} with i − j ≡ ±1, . . . , ±α (mod n), and
every other pair appears in λ blocks. A (linear) LBSAλ (n, k; α) is an (n, k, λ)-packing (X, B)
with X = [0, n − 1] whose leave graph consists of all the edges {i, j} with 0 ≤ i < j < n
for which j − i ≤ α, and every other pair appears in λ blocks. We employ these only when
λ = 1, and so omit λ in the notation.
We generalize circular and linear BSAs (with λ = 1) to a packing sampling plan avoiding
adjacent units (PSA). A (circular) CPSA(n, k; α) is an (n, k)-packing (X, B) with X = Zn
whose leave graph contains all the edges {i, j} with i − j ≡ ±1, . . . , ±α (mod n), and every
other pair appears in at most one block. A (linear) LPSA(n, k; α) is an (n, k)-packing (X, B)
with X = [0, n − 1] whose leave graph contains all the edges {i, j} with 0 ≤ i < j < n
for which j − i ≤ α, and every other pair appears in at most one block. (In this case, every
CPSA(n, k; α) is an LPSA(n, k; α) but the converse need not hold.) Let B(n, k; α) denote
the largest size of any LPSA(n, k; α); the LPSA is optimal if its size is B(n, k; α). Similarly,
let B ◦ (n, k; α) denote the largest size of any CPSA(n, k; α); the CPSA is optimal if its size
is B ◦ (n, k; α).

2.4 Problem formulation
Limited weight codes have been widely exploited for the case of on-chip communication
to achieve crosstalk coupling elimination and energy efficiency [12,23]. We consider an nbit parallel bus in a single metal layer, for which we want memoryless codes to weaken
crosstalk, reduce power consumption, and correct errors. We use constant weight codes with
small weight to achieve low power similarly by reducing the node switching activity, that is,
reducing the total number of transitions occurring between the newly arrived data and the
present data on the bus.

123

484

Assume an n-bit bus, consisting of signals b0 , b1 , b2 , . . . , bn−1 . Consider a group of three
wires in an on-chip bus, which are driven by signals bi−1 , bi and bi+1 . The delay and energy
consumption are primarily affected by transition patterns based on the bus signals bi−1 , bi
and bi+1 as the crosstalk patterns in Table 1.
The selection of codeword does not depend on previous history, so the environment is
memoryless. Consequently coding must address the possibility that any two codewords can
appear one after the other. Therefore to avoid crosstalk and correct errors, we are interested
in constant weight codes of length n, weight w and minimum distance d ≥ 3 satisfying the
condition that there do not exist three consecutive coordinates i − 1, i, i + 1 such that the
crosstalk couplings of type-2 (or -3, -4) occur in any two different codewords.
We denote such a code avoiding crosstalk of each type as an (n, d, w)-II (or -III, -IV)
code. The maximum size of these codes are denoted as A I I (n, d, w) (or A I I I (n, d, w),
A I V (n, d, w)), and any code achieving this size is optimal. When S ⊆ {I I, I I I, I V }, the
maximum size of a code that is simultaneously an (n, d, w)-S code for each S ∈ S is denoted
by AS (n, d, w).
When d = 2w, the following results are straightforward.
Lemma 2.3 For all positive integers n and w,
 
(i) A I I (n, 2w, w) = A I V (n, 2w, w) = wn ;




(ii) A I I I (n, 2w, w) = wn when w  = 1; A I I I (n, 2, 1) = n+1
2 .
 
Proof The quantity s = wn is an upper bound on the size of the desired code in each case.
We construct codes of size s as follows. The code with support
{{i, s + i, 2s + i, . . . , (w − 1)s + i} : i ∈ [0, s − 1]}
is an optimal (n, 2w, w)-II code. The code with support
{{wi, 1 + wi, . . . , (w − 1) + wi} : i ∈ [0, s − 1]}
is an optimal (n, 2w, w)-IV code, and an optimal


(n, 2w, w)-III code when w  = 1. When
w = 1, the code with support {{2i} : i ∈ [0, n−1


2 ]} is an optimal (n, 2, 1)-III code.
Next we show there is close connection between (n, 2k − 2, k) codes of each type and
optimal LPSA(n, k)s. Hence, optimal codes are constructed based on the construction of
optimal LPSA(n, k)s.

3 Codes and LPSA(n, k; α)s
In this section, we establish connections between optimal LPSA(n, k; α)s and the codes of
each type. We begin with optimal (n, 2k − 2, k)-II codes for sufficiently large n.
Theorem 3.1 Let k ≥ 3. Then A I I (n, 2k − 2, k) ≥ B(n, k). Further, if B(n, k) = U (n, k)
and n ≥ 3k 2 + 2k − 3, then A I I (n, 2k − 2, k) = B(n, k).
Proof Whenever (X, B) is an LPSA(n, k), the code with support B is an (n, 2k−2, k)-II code.
Now suppose that (X, B) is an optimal LPSA(n, k) of size U (n, k). We prove that U (n, k)
is the largest possible size of an (n, 2k − 2, k)-II code. Assume that D is an (n, 2k − 2, k)-II
code of size M. Partition the code into three parts as follows.
The first part A contains all codewords with at least one segment “11”. Because n > k, for
each codeword in A, there always exist three adjacent coordinates such that “110” or “011”

123

Optimal low-power coding for crosstalk avoidance

appears in these coordinates. Let S = {i : ∃u ∈ A, s.t.,u has “110 in coordinates i − 2, i −
1, i, or “011” in coordinates i, i + 1, i + 2}, and let s = |S|. For each i ∈ S, there exist at
most two codewords in A that have “110” in i − 2, i − 1, i or “011” in i, i + 1, i + 2. Hence
|A| ≤ 2s.
The second part T ⊆ D \ A contains all codewords with “1” in at least one coordinate in
S. Without loss of generality, if there exists a codeword in A with “110” in the coordinates
i − 2, i − 1, i for some i, then the codewords in T with “1” in i must have segment “101”
in these coordinates to avoid type-2 crosstalk. Because dmin (D) = 2k − 2, there is only one
such codeword. So for each i ∈ S, there is at most one codeword in T with “1” in i. Hence
|T | ≤ s.
Finally, let C = D \ (A ∪ T ). Then M = |A| + |T | + |C |. Because each codeword in C
has “0” in all coordinates in S, we can shorten C to a code C  by deleting all coordinates in
S. Then C  is an (n − s, 2k − 2, k) code, and supp(C  ) is an (n − s, k)-packing.
The shortening process partitions the coordinates of C  into at most s +1 classes, separated
in C by the coordinates deleted to form C  . No codeword of C  has “11” in consecutive
coordinates of any single class. Let x be the number of isolated coordinates in this partition,
and m be the number of classes with at least two coordinates; then x + m ≤ s + 1. We now
estimate the 	
size of C

No prohibited situation arises from 000 or 111 in three consecutive coordinates of a codeword.
In consecutive coordinates in which two codewords of C2 are neither 000 nor 111, the two
codewords contain 011 and 110, which is permitted. So we consider one codeword from
C1 and one from C2 . The coordinates with indices in {2i + 1 : 0 ≤ i <  n−1

only one codeword, which is {2i, 2i + 1, 2i + 2}. So in the consecutive coordinates in which
two such codewords are neither 000 nor 111, and are not equal, the two codewords contain
{001, 100}, {010, 011}, or {010, 110}. All are permitted.

Lemma 3.3 A I V (n, 2k − 2, k) ≥ B(n, k).
Proof Take an LPSA(n, k) (X, B) of size B(n, k). Apply to the points in [0, n − 1] the
permutation

i → 2i, if i < n/2, and
i → 2i − 2n/2 + 1, if i ≥ n/2,
to get (X, B ). The code C  with supp(C  ) = B is an (n, 2k − 2, k)-IV code.




We give another construction for an (n, 2k−2, k)-IV code from an optimal LPSA(n, k; k−
1). When k = 3, this construction gives a better lower bound than Lemma 3.3.
Lemma 3.4 Let k ≥ 3.
1. A I I,I V (n, 2k − 2, k) ≥ B(n, k; k − 1),

3. A (n, 2k − 2, k) ≥ B (n, k; k − 1) + k−1 .


	
Proof Let s = n−1
k−1 , and (X, B ) be an LPSA(n, k; k − 1) of size B(n, k; k − 1). Then the
code C with supp(C ) = {B : B ∈ B} is an (n, 2k −2, k)-II code and an (n, 2k −2, k)-IV code.
Further, the code C with supp(C ) = {B : B ∈ B}∪{{(k−1)i, (k−1)i +1, . . . , (k−1)i +k−1} :
i ∈ [0, s −1]} is an (n, 2k −2, k)-IV code. When n  ≡ 0 (mod k − 1), statement (3) is implied
by statement (2). So suppose that n ≡ 0 (mod k − 1). Using instead a CPSA(n, k; k − 1) of
size B ◦ (n, k; k − 1), adjoin the block {(k − 1)s, (k − 1)s + 1, . . . , (k − 1)s + k − 2, 0}.

Y. M. Chee et al.

A I I,I V (16, 4, 3) = U (16, 3; 2) = 32. Suppose to the contrary that A I I,I V (n, 4, 3) >
U (n, 3; 2) for some n ≥ 17, and let n be the smallest such value. When n ≥ 17 we have
U (n, 3; 2) ≥ U (n − 1, 3; 2) + 3 and U (n, 3; 2) ≥ U (n − 3, 3; 2) + 4. (See Table 2 for small
values.)
Let (X, B) be the support of an (n, 4, 3)-{II,IV} code of size A I I,I V (n, 4, 3). Some triple
of B covers a pair of the form {a, b} ∈ {{i, i +1}, {i, i +2}} because it is not an LPSA(n, 3; 2).
Case 1 Some element appears in at most one triple. Suppose that element i appears in no
triple. Shorten the code by deleting coordinate i and delete the triples (if any) containing
pairs {i − 1, i + 1}, {i − 2, i + 1}, and {i − 1, i + 2}. The result is a type II and IV code, so
the given code has at most A I I,I V (n − 1, 4, 3) + 3 triples, a contradiction. Suppose now that
element i appears in exactly one triple T . Then if i ∈ {0, n − 1}, delete coordinate i and triple
T to get a contradiction. If i ∈ {1, n − 2}, delete coordinate i and delete triple T , along with
triples containing {0, 2} and {0, 3} when i = 1 or {n − 4, n − 1} and {n − 3, n − 1}, to get a
contradiction. So 2 ≤ i ≤ n−3. If T contains neither i −1 nor i +1, then no triple contains both
i −1 and i +1, because the code is type IV. Shorten by deleting coordinate i and delete triple T
and the triples (if any) containing pairs {i −2, i +1} and {i −1, i +2}, yielding a contradiction.
Otherwise, without loss of generality T also contains i − 1 but does not contain i + 1. But
then if some triple T  contains i − 2 and i + 1, it cannot contain i. If T  does not also contain
i − 1, then we have T ∩ {i − 1, i, i + 1} = {i − 1, i} and T  ∩ {i − 1, i, i + 1} = {i + 1},
which cannot happen in a type II code. So T  = {i − 2, i, i + 1}. Hence there are at most
two triples among those containing pairs {i − 1, i + 1}, {i − 2, i + 1}, and {i − 1, i + 2}, so
shorten as before.
Case 2 Some triple T satisfies |T ∩ {i, i + 1, i + 2}| = 2 for some 0 ≤ i ≤ n − 3. Suppose
that {a, b} = T ∩ {i, i + 1, i + 2} and let {c} = {i, i + 1, i + 2} \ {a, b}. There can be no triple
containing c but neither a nor b, because the code is type II and type IV. So c is in exactly two
triples, T  that contains a and T  that contains b; only T contains both a and b. Applying the
same argument to T  and T  , a and b each appear in exactly two triples. So there are only
three triples (T , T  , and T  ) that contain a, b, or c. Shorten by deleting coordinate i + 1 and
the triples T , T  , and T  to obtain a contradiction.
Case 3 No triple T satisfies |T ∩ {i, i + 1, i + 2}| = 2 for any 0 ≤ i ≤ n − 3. If a triple
T satisfies |T ∩ {i, i + 1, i + 2}| = 3 for some 0 ≤ i ≤ n − 3, equivalently it satisfies
|T ∩ {i + 1, i + 2, i + 3}| = 2 for some 0 ≤ i ≤ n − 4 or |T ∩ {i − 1, i, i + 1}| = 2 for some
1 ≤ i ≤ n − 3. Apply Case 2. Otherwise every triple T satisfies |T ∩ {i, i + 1, i + 2}| ≤ 1 for
0 ≤ i ≤ n − 3. But then (X, B) is an LPSA(n, 3; 2) and hence we have at most B(n, 3; 2) ≤
U (n, 3; 2) triples, the final contradiction.

Proof When n ≡ 3 (mod 6), Colbourn and Rosa [4] (and Colbourn and Ling [5]) construct
2
a BSA(n, 3) of size n −3n
6 , which is an optimal LPSA(n, 3). Because each point appears in

(n−1) −4(n−1)+4
blocks, we get an LPSA(n − 1, 3) of size n −3n

by removing

the point n − 1 and all blocks containing it, which is optimal.
When n ≡ 1, 5 (mod 6), Colbourn and Rosa [4] showed there exists an (n, 3)-packing of

, whose leave graph consists of a cycle of length n − 1 and one isolated point.
6
Assume n −1 is the isolated point. Remove the block {x, n −2, n −1} for some x ∈ [0, n −3];
the result is an optimal LPSA(n, 3). Now, n − 1 appears in n−3
2 blocks. Removing n − 1
and all blocks containing it from the optimal LPSA(n, 3) constructed above, we obtain an

n-cycle with two additional edges, but every vertex in the leave must have even degree, which
cannot occur. So B ◦ (n, 3) ≤ U (n, 3) − 1. To establish equality when n ≡ 1, 2, 5 (mod 6),
remove the block {0, n − 1, x} from an LPSA(n, 3) from Theorem 4.1.


Lemma 4.3 B ◦ (n, 3; 2) = B(n, 3; 2) = U (n, 3; 2) whenever n ≡ 3, 5 (mod 6) and n ≥
15. B ◦ (n, 3; 2) + 2 = B(n, 3; 2) = U (n, 3; 2) whenever n ≡ 2, 4 (mod 6) and n ≥ 14.
Proof Zhang and Chang [30] establish that whenever n ≥ 15 and n ≡ 3, 5 (mod 6), there is a
BSA(n, 3; 2) having n(n−5)
blocks; this is also an optimal CPSA(n, 3; 2) and LPSA(n, 3; 2).
6
Now suppose that n ≥ 14 and n ≡ 2, 4 (mod 6). When n ≡ 2 (mod 6), writing n = 6t + 2,
U (6t + 2, 3; 2) = (2t)(3t − 1). Delete element 6t + 2 from a BSA(6t + 3, 3; 2) with
(2t + 1)(3t − 1) blocks, removing 3t − 1 blocks to obtain an LPSA(6t + 2, 3; 2), which is
therefore optimal. When n ≡ 4 (mod 6), writing n = 6t + 4, U (6t + 4, 3; 2) = t (6t + 2).
Delete element 6t + 4 from a BSA(6t + 5, 3; 2) with t (6t + 5) blocks, removing 3t blocks to
obtain an LPSA(6t + 4, 3; 2), which is therefore optimal. Remove the blocks {0, n − 2, x},
{1, n − 1, y} for some x and y from the optimal LPSA(n, 3; 2) constructed above to obtain
an optimal CPSA(n, 3; 2) when n ≡ 2, 4 (mod 6).


	 	



For n = 6t, U (6t, 3) = 6t (t − 1) + 1, and 6t3 6t−5
= 6t (t − 1). For n = 6t + 1,
2
 6t+1  6t−4 

U (6t +1, 3) = t (6t −3), and 3
= t (6t −3)−1. However, if a CPSA(6t +1, 3; 2)
2
were to have t (6t − 3) − 1 blocks, its leave must have 2(6t + 1) + 1 edges and every such
graph with minimum degree 4 has two vertices of degree 5. Because all vertices in the leave
must have even degree, no CPSA(6t + 1, 3; 2) can exist with more than t (6t − 3) − 2 blocks.
We provide bounds to apply when n ≡ 0, 1 (mod 6).
Lemma 4.4 B(2n, 3; 2) ≥ 4B(n, 3), and B(2n + 1, 3; 2) ≥ 4B(n, 3) + n − 2. In addition,
B ◦ (2n, 3; 2) ≥ 4B ◦ (n, 3), and B ◦ (2n + 1, 3; 2) ≥ 4B ◦ (n, 3) + n − 3.

Y. M. Chee et al.

Proof Start with an LPSA(n, 3) on [0, n − 1]. We form an LPSA(2n, 3; 2) on [0, 2n − 1].
For each block {a, b, c} in the LPSA, form four blocks {{2a + α, 2b + β, 2c + γ } : α, β, γ ∈
{0, 1}, α + β + γ ≡ 0 (mod 2)}. The verification is straightforward. To form an LPSA(2n +
1, 3) on [0, 2n], adjoin {{2i, 2i + 3, 2n} : 0 ≤ i ≤ n − 3}.
The construction for CPSAs is the same, except that one does not adjoin {0, 3, 2n}.



5 Conclusion
Applying Theorem 3.1 with the results in Theorem 4.1, we have optimal (n, 4, 3)-II codes for
all n ≥ 30. By computer search (using cliquer [13] and hill-climbing (a variant of [24])),
we determined the sizes of optimal LPSA(n, 3; α)s, CPSA(n, 3; α)s, and (n, 4, 3) codes of
lengths n ≤ 20. The sizes are listed in Table 2 and corresponding optimal codes are available
from the authors; those in slanted font are lower bounds from Theorem 3.1 and Lemma 3.4.
In this paper, we present the first memoryless transition bus-encoding technique for power
minimization, error-correcting and elimination of crosstalk simultaneously. We establish the
connection between codes avoiding crosstalk of each type with packing sampling plans
avoiding adjacent units. Optimal codes of each type are constructed.

A Discrete Particle Swarm Optimization for
Covering Array Generation

Abstract—Software behavior depends on many factors.
Combinatorial testing (CT) aims to generate small sets of test
cases to uncover defects caused by those factors and their
interactions. Covering array generation, a discrete optimization
problem, is the most popular research area in the field of CT.
Particle swarm optimization (PSO), an evolutionary search-based
heuristic technique, has succeeded in generating covering arrays
that are competitive in size. However, current PSO methods for
covering array generation simply round the particle’s position
to an integer to handle the discrete search space. Moreover, no
guidelines are available to effectively set PSOs parameters for
this problem. In this paper, we extend the set-based PSO, an
existing discrete PSO (DPSO) method, to covering array generation. Two auxiliary strategies (particle reinitialization and
additional evaluation of gbest) are proposed to improve performance, and thus a novel DPSO for covering array generation
is developed. Guidelines for parameter settings both for conventional PSO (CPSO) and for DPSO are developed systematically
here. Discrete extensions of four existing PSO variants are developed, in order to further investigate the effectiveness of DPSO
for covering array generation. Experiments show that CPSO can
produce better results using the guidelines for parameter settings,
and that DPSO can generate smaller covering arrays than CPSO
and other existing evolutionary algorithms. DPSO is a promising
improvement on PSO for covering array generation.

failures at a low cost is a key issue for test case generation. Combinatorial testing (CT) is a popular testing method
to detect failures triggered by various factors and their interactions [1]. By employing covering arrays as test suites, the CT
method aims to sample the large combination space with few
test cases to cover different interactions among a fixed number of factors. Kuhn and Reilly [2] shows that more than 70%
of the failures in certain software were caused by the interactions of one or two factors, and almost all the failures could
be detected by checking the interactions among six factors.
Therefore, CT can be an effective method in practice.
Generating a covering array with fewest tests (minimum
size) is a major challenge in CT. In general, the minimum
size of a covering array is unknown; hence, methods have
focused on finding covering arrays that have as few tests as
possible at reasonable search cost. The many methods that
have been proposed can be classified into two main groups:
1) mathematical methods and 2) computational methods [1].
Mathematical (algebraic or combinatorial) methods typically
exploit some known combinatorial structure. Computational
methods primarily use greedy strategies or heuristic-search
techniques to generate covering arrays, due to the size of the
search space.
Mathematical methods yield the best possible covering
arrays in certain cases. For example, orthogonal arrays used
in the design of experiments provide covering arrays with a
number of tests that is provably minimum. However, all known
mathematical methods can be applied only for restrictive sets
of factors. This limitation has led to an emphasis on computational methods. Greedy algorithms have been quite effective
in generating covering arrays, but their accuracy suffers from
becoming trapped in local optima.
In recent years, search-based software engineering (SBSE)
has focused on using search-based optimization algorithms
to find high-quality solutions for software engineering problems. Inspired by SBSE, many artificial intelligence-based
heuristic-search techniques have been applied to software
testing. For example, simulated annealing (SA) [3]–[7],
genetic algorithm (GA) [8]–[10], and ant colony
optimization (ACO) [9], [11], [12] have all been applied
to covering array generation. These techniques can generate
any types of covering arrays, and the constraint solving
and prioritization techniques can be easily integrated. Their
applications have been shown to be effective, producing
relatively small covering arrays in many cases. Particle swarm
optimization (PSO), a relatively new evolutionary algorithm,

has also been used in this area [13]–[16]. It is easy to
implement and has fast initial progress.
The conventional PSO (CPSO) algorithm was originally
designed to find optimal or near optimal solutions in a
continuous space. Nevertheless, many discrete PSO (DPSO)
algorithms and frameworks have been developed to solve
discrete problems [17]–[22]. For covering array generation,
current discrete methods [13]–[16] simply round the particle’s
position to an integer while keeping the velocity as a real
number. They suffer from two main shortcomings. First, the
performance of PSO is significantly impacted by its parameter
settings. In [23], effects of the general parameter selection and
initial population of PSO have been analyzed, but no guidelines on parameter settings have been reported for covering
array generation. Hence, a clear understanding of how to set
these execution parameters is needed. Second, simple rounding
fractional positions to integers introduces a substantial source
of errors in the search. Instead, a specialized DPSO version is
needed. Because current PSO methods show promise for generating covering arrays, these two main shortcomings should
be addressed.
In this paper, we adapt set-based PSO (S-PSO) [18] to
generate covering arrays. S-PSO utilizes set and probability
theories to develop a new representation scheme for combinatorial optimization problems as well as refining the related
evolution operators. In our adaptation of S-PSO, two auxiliary strategies are proposed to enhance performance, and
a novel DPSO algorithm is thus proposed. DPSO has the
same conceptual basis and exhibits similar search behavior to
CPSO, with parameters playing similar roles. Then, we explore
the optimal parameter settings for both CPSO and DPSO to
improve their performance, and identify recommended settings. Furthermore, because many CPSO variants [24]–[27]
can be easily extended to discrete versions based on our DPSO,
the performance of these discrete versions is also compared
with their original ones. Finally, we compare CPSO and DPSO
with existing GA and ACO [9], [11] algorithms to generate
covering arrays.
The main contributions of this paper are as follows.
1) Based on the set-based representation, we design a
version of S-PSO [18] for covering array generation.
2) We propose two auxiliary strategies, particle reinitialization, and additional evaluation of gbest, to enhance the
performance of PSO. A novel DPSO for covering array
generation is proposed.
3) We design experiments to explore the optimal parameter settings for CPSO and DPSO for covering array
generation.
4) We implement original and discrete versions of four
representative PSO variants (TVAC [24], CLPSO [25],
APSO [26], and DMS-PSO [27]) to compare their
efficacy for covering array generation.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section II
gives background on CT, covering array generation, and
the CPSO algorithm. Section III summarizes related work.
Section IV presents our DPSO algorithm, including the
representation scheme, related operators, and two auxiliary
strategies. Section V evaluates the performance of CPSO and

DPSO, and explores optimal parameter settings. Section VI
gives a comparison among CPSO, DPSO, and original and
discrete variants. Section VII compares CPSO and DPSO
with GA and ACO. Section VIII concludes this paper and
outlines future work.
II. BACKGROUND
A. CT
Suppose that the behavior of the software under test (SUT)
is controlled by n independent factors, which may represent configuration parameters, internal or external events, user
inputs, and the like. The ith factor has i discrete levels, chosen from the finite set Vi of size i . An n-tuple (x1 , x2 , . . . , xn )
forms a test case, where xi ∈ Vi for 1 ≤ i ≤ n.
Consider a simple e-commerce software system [15]. This
system consists of five different components. Each of these five
components can be regarded as a factor, and its configurations
can be regarded as different levels. Table I shows these five
factors and their corresponding levels. In this example, n = 5,
1 = 2 = 3 = 2, 4 = 5 = 3.
System failures are often triggered by interactions among
some factors, which can be represented by the combinations
of factor levels. In order to detect these failures, their combinations should be covered at least once by the test suite. A
t-way schema can be used to represent them.
Definition 1 (t-way schema): The n-tuple (−, y1 , . . . ,
yt , . . . ) is a t-way schema (t > 0) when some t factors
have fixed levels and the others can take any valid levels,
represented as “−.”
For example, suppose that when factor Payment Server
takes the level Master and factor Web Server takes the level
Apache, a system failure occurs. To detect this failure, the
2-way schema (Master, –, Apache, –, –) must be covered
at least once by the test suite. To simplify later discussion,
we use the index in the level set of each factor to present
a schema. For example, (0, –, 1, –, –) is used to represent
(Master, –, Apache, –, –).
Exhaustive testing covers all n-way schemas of the system; in our example, it uses 2 × 2 × 2 × 3 × 3 = 72 test
cases. Testing cost becomes prohibitive as the numbers of factors and levels increase. Moreover, because only interactions
among few factors are likely to trigger failures [2], testing
high-way schemas can lead to many uninformative test cases.
At the other extreme, if we only guarantee to cover each 1-way
schema once, only three test cases are needed (a single test
case can cover five 1-way schemas at most). But we may
fail to detect some interaction triggered failures involving two
factors.

Instead, CT covers all t-way schemas. Such a test suite is a
t-way covering array, with t being the covering strength. The
value of t determines the depth of coverage. It is a key setting
of CT, and should be decided by the testers. We give a precise
definition.
Definition 2 (Covering Array): If an N×n array, where N is
the number of test cases, has the following properties: 1) each
column i (1 ≤ i ≤ n) contains only elements from the set Vi
with i = |Vi | and 2) the rows of each N × t sub array cover
all |Vk1 | × |Vk2 | × . . . × |Vkt | combinations of the t columns at
least once, where t ≤ n and 1 ≤ k1 < . . . < kt ≤ n, then it is a
t-way covering array, denoted by CA(N; t, n, (1 , 2 , . . . , n )).
When 1 = 2 = . . . = n = , it is denoted by CA(N; t, n, ).
Reference [2] demonstrated that more than 70% failures can
be detected by a 2-way covering array, and almost all failures
can be detected by a 6-way covering array. Hence, using CT,
we can detect many failures of the system by applying relatively low strength covering arrays. In other words, CT can
greatly reduce the size of test suite while maintaining high
fault detection ability.
In the example of Table I, if we only consider the interactions between any two factors, only nine test cases are
required to construct a 2-way covering array instead of 72
for exhaustive testing. Table II shows a covering array, where
each row represents one test case. This table covers all possible 2-way schemas for any two factors corresponding to the
columns. For example, consider factor Payment Server and
User Browser, all 2×3 = 6 schemas, (Master, –, –, Firefox, –)
(Master, –, –, Explorer, –), (Master, –, –, Chrome, –),
(VISA, –, –, Firefox, –), (VISA, –, –, Explorer, –),
(VISA, –, –, Chrome, –), can be found in the table.
For convenience, if several groups of gi factors (gi < n) have
g
the same number of levels ak , ak i can be used to represent
these factors and their levels. Thus, the coveringarray can

gi = n,
be denoted by CA(N; t, a11 , a22 , . . . , ak k ) where
n
or CA(N; t, a ) when g1 = n and a1 = a. For example, the
covering array in Table II is a CA(9; 2, 23 32 ).
In many software systems, the impacts of the interactions
among factors are not uniform. Some interactions may be more
prone to trigger system failures, while other may have little or no impact on the system. To effectively detect these
different interactions, variable strength (VS) covering arrays
can be applied. This can offer different covering strengths

577

to different groups of factors, and can therefore provide a
practical approach to test real applications.
Definition 3 (VS Covering Array): A VS covering array,

denoted by VCA(N; t, a11 . . . akk , CA1 (t1 , bm

CAj (tj , cn11 . . . cqq )), is an N × n covering array of covering
strength t containing one or more sub covering arrays, namely
CA1 , . . . , CAj , each of which has covering strength t1 , . . . , tj
all larger than t.
Consider the e-commerce system shown in Table I. If the
interactions of three factors, Payment Server, Web Server, and
Business Database, have a higher probability to trigger system failures, then a VS covering array can be constructed.
As in Table II, only three more test cases (Table III) are
needed to construct the VCA(12; 2, 23 32 , CA(3, 22 31 )). With
these 12 test cases, not only are all 2-way schemas of all five
factors covered, but also all 3-way schemas of these three factors (Payment Server, Web Server, and Business Database) are
covered.
B. Covering Array Generation
Covering arrays are used as test suites in CT. Covering array
generation is the process of test suite construction. It is the
most active area in CT with more than 50% of research papers
focusing on this field [1]. Due to limited testing resources, all
aim to construct a minimal covering array while still maintaining full coverage of combinations. Computational methods
have been used widely for covering array generation because
they can be applied to any systems. In general, these methods
generate all possible combinations first. Then they generate
test cases to cover these combinations one-by-one. One-testat-a-time is the most widely used strategy among evolutionary
algorithms to generate a covering array.
The one-test-at-a-time strategy was popularized by
AETG [28] and was further used by Bryce and Colbourn [29].
This strategy takes the model of SUT(n, 1 , . . . , n ) where
n is the number of factors and i is the number of valid
levels of factor i, and the covering strength t as input. At
first, an empty test suite TS and a set S of t-way schemas
to be covered are initialized. In each iteration, a test case is
generated with the highest fitness value according to some
heuristic techniques. Then it is added to TS and the t-way
schemas covered by it are removed. When all the t-way
schemas have been covered, the final test suite TS is returned.
This process is shown in Algorithm 1.
In this strategy, a fitness function must be used to evaluate
the quality of a candidate test case (line 6 in Algorithm 1). It is
an important part of all heuristic techniques. In covering array
generation, the fitness function takes the test case as the input
and then outputs a fitness value representing its “goodness.”
It is defined as follows.

according to some heuristics
7:
Add p to the test suite TS
8:
Remove the t-way schemas covered by p from S
9: end while
10: return TS

Definition 4 (Fitness Function): Let TS be the generated
test set, and p be a test case. Then fitness(p) is the number of
uncovered t-way schemas in TS that are covered by p.
The fitness function can be formulated as
fitness(p) = |schemat ({p}) − schemat (TS)|

(1)

where schemat (TS) represents the set of all t-way schemas
covered by test set TS, and | · | stands for cardinality. When
all Cnt t-way schemas covered by p are not covered by TS,
the fitness function reaches the maximum value fitness(p) =
|schemat ({p})| = Cnt .
For example, consider the 2-way covering array generation
of the e-commerce system shown in Table II. Suppose that
TS consists of test cases (0, 0, 0, 0, 0) and (0, 0, 1, 1, 1).
The fitness function computes the fitness value for a candidate test case p = (1, 0, 1, 2, 2) as follows: because p covers
ten 2-way schemas, namely schema2 ({p}) = {(1, 0, –, –, –),
(1, –, 1, –, –,), (1, –, –, 2, –), (1, –, –, –, 2), (–, 0, 1, –, –),
(–, 0, –, 2, –), (–, 0, –, –, 2), (–, –, 1, 2, –), (–, –, 1, –, 2),
(–, –, –, 2, 2)} and TS only covers (–, 0, 1, –, –) in p, the
function returns fitness(p) = 9.
C. PSO
PSO is a swarm-based evolutionary computation technique.
It was developed by Kennedy et al. [30], inspired by the social
behavior of bird flocking and fish schooling. PSO utilizes a
population of particles as a set of candidate solutions. Each
of the particles represents a certain position in the problem
hyperspace with a given velocity. A fitness function is used
to evaluate the quality of each particle. Initially, particles are
distributed in the hyperspace uniformly. Then each particle
repeatedly updates its state according to the individual best
position in its history (pbest) and the current global best position (gbest). Eventually, each particle possibly moves toward
the direction of the individual optimum and global optimum,
and finds an optimal or near optimal solution.
Suppose that the problem domain is a D−dimensional
hyperspace. Then the position and velocity of particle i can
be represented by xi ∈ RD and vi ∈ RD respectively. CPSO
uses the following equations to update a particle’s velocity
and position, where vi,j (k) represents the jth component of the
velocity of particle i at the kth iteration, and xi,j (k) represents

its corresponding position:
vi,j (k + 1) = ω × vi,j (k) + c1 × r1,j × (pbesti,j − xi,j (k))
(2)
+ c2 × r2,j × (gbestj − xi,j (k))
xi,j (k + 1) = xi,j (k) + vi,j (k + 1).

(3)

The best position of particle i in its history is pbesti , and
gbest is the best position among all particles. The velocityupdate equation (2) captures the three basic concepts of PSO.
The first is inertia, the tendency of the particle to continue in
the direction it has been moving. The second is memory of
the best position ever found by itself. The third is cooperation
using the best position found by other particles.
The parameter ω is inertia weight. It controls the balance between exploration (global search state) and exploitation
(local search state). Two positive real numbers c1 and c2
are acceleration constants that control the movement tendency toward the individual and global best position. Most
studies set ω = 0.9, and c1 = c2 = 2 to get the best
balance [17], [31], [32]. In addition, r1,j and r2,j are two uniformly distributed random numbers in the range of [0.0, 1.0],
used to ensure the diversity of the population.
If the problem domain (the search space of particles) has
bounds, a bound handling strategy is adopted to keep the particles inside the search space. Many different strategies have
been proposed [33]. In the reflecting strategy, when a particle
exceeds the bound of the search space in any dimension, the
particle direction is reversed in this dimension to get back to
the search space. For example, in case of a dimension with
a range of values from 0 to 2, if a particle moves to 3, its
position is reversed to 1.
In addition, as the velocity can increase over time, a limit
is set on velocity to prevent an infinite velocity or invalid
position for the particle. Setting a maximum velocity, which
determines the distance of movement from the current position
to the possible target position, can reduce the likelihood of
explosion of the swarm traveling distance [31]. Generally, the
value of the maximum velocity is selected as i /2, where i
is the range of dimension i.
The pseudocode in Algorithm 2 presents the process of generating a test case by PSO. This algorithm can be invoked
by line 6 of Algorithm 1 to generate a test case for t-way
schemas. The n factors of the test case can be treated as an
n-dimensional hyperspace. A particle pi = (x1 , x2 , . . . , xn ) can
be regarded as a candidate test case. The fitness function is
that of Definition 4, the number of uncovered t-way schemas
in the generated test suite that are covered by particle pi . PSO
employs real numbers but the valid values are integers for covering array generation, so each dimension of particle’s position
can be rounded to an integer while maintaining the velocity
as a real number. This method is used in all prior research
applying PSO to covering array generation [13]–[16].
III. R ELATED W ORK
In this section, three different but related aspects are discussed. We first summarize search-based CT, especially the
current applications of PSO for covering array generation.
Then, we introduce prior research on discrete versions of PSO,

to improve CPSO for discrete problems. Finally, some PSO
variants are introduced. These try to enhance PSO for conventional continuous problems by adopting strategies that can
further improve covering array generation.
A. PSO in Search-Based CT
SBSE has grown quickly in recent years. Many problems
in software engineering have been formulated into searchbased optimization problems, and heuristic techniques have
been used to find solutions. Software testing is a major topic
in software engineering. Many heuristic techniques have also
been applied to this field, including functional testing, mutation testing, stress testing, temporal testing, CT, and regression
testing. Currently, many classic heuristic techniques, such as
SA [3]–[7], GA [8]–[10], and ACO [9], [11], [12] have been
applied to generate uniform and VS covering arrays
successfully.
PSO has also been applied to software testing.
Windisch et al. [34] applied PSO to structural testing,
and compared its performance with GA. They showed that
PSO outperformed GA for most cases in terms of effectiveness and efficiency. Ganjali [35] proposed a framework for
automatic test partitioning based on PSO, observing that PSO
performed better than other existing heuristic techniques.
PSO has been applied to covering array generation.
Ahmed and Zamli [15] proposed frameworks of PSO to generate different kinds of covering arrays, including t-way
(PSTG [14]) and VS-PSTG. Then they extended PSTG to support VS covering array generation [16]. Chen et al. [18] also

579

applied PSO to 2-way covering array generation. They further
used a test suite minimization algorithm to reduce the size of
the generated covering array.
Current applications of PSO for covering array generation
can yield smaller covering arrays than most greedy algorithms,
but they all apply the same rounding operator to the particle’s
position, and they lack guidelines on the parameter settings.
B. Discrete Versions of PSO
PSO was initially developed to solve problems in continuous
space, but PSO can also be applied to some discrete optimization problems including binary or general integer variables.
Many discrete versions of PSO have been proposed [17]–[22].
Chen et al. [18] classify existing algorithms into four
types.
1) Swap operator-based PSO [19] uses a permutation of
numbers as position and a set of swaps as velocity.
2) Space transformation-based PSO [20] uses various techniques to transform the position, defined as a vector of
real numbers, to the corresponding solution in discrete
space.
3) Fuzzy matrix-based PSO [21] defines the position and
velocity as a fuzzy matrix, and decode it to a feasible
solution.
4) Incorporating-based PSO [22] consists of hybrid methods incorporating some heuristic or problem dependent
techniques.
Chen et al. [18] also propose a S-PSO method based on
sets with probabilities, which we later adapt to represent a
particle’s velocity. S-PSO uses a set-based scheme to represent the discrete search space. The velocity is defined as
a set with probabilities, and the operators are all replaced
by procedures defined on the set. They extend some PSO
variants to discrete versions and test them on the traveling
salesman problem and the multidimensional knapsack problem. They show that the discrete version of CLPSO [25] can
perform better than other variants. S-PSO was found to characterize the combinatorial optimization problems very well.
Gong et al. [36] then employed such a set-based representation scheme for solving vehicle routing problems to obtain a
new method, S-PSO-VRPTW.
C. PSO Variants
The original PSO may become trapped in a local optimum.
In order to improve the performance, many variants have been
proposed [17], [24]–[27]. Chen et al. [37] classify these variants into four different groups. The first group of variants aims
to adjust the control parameters during the evolution, for example by decreasing inertia weight ω linearly from 0.9 to 0.4 over
the search process. The second group employs different neighborhood topologies. The basic local version of PSO makes
the particle learn from the local best position lbesti found by
particle i’s neighborhood instead of the global best position
gbest. RPSO and VPSO are two common versions which use
a ring topology and a Von Neumann topology, respectively.
The third group uses hybrid strategies with other search techniques. Many types of operators, such as genetic operators

(selection, crossover, and mutation), evolutionary computation
paradigms and biology inspired operators have been used. The
fourth uses multiswarm techniques. Several sets of swarms
optimize different components of the solution concurrently or
cooperatively.
In our experiments, four representative PSO variants are
included, as follows.
1) Ratnaweera et al. [24] proposed a typical variant of
the first group, TVAC, which uses a time varying
inertia weight and acceleration constant to adjust the
parameters.
2) Liang et al. [25] proposed the CLPSO method, a wellknown variant of the second group, which allows the
particle to learn from other particles’ individual best
positions in different dimensions.
3) Zhan et al. [26] proposed an adaptive PSO (APSO)
that can be seen as a variant of the third group. They
developed an evolutionary state estimation to adaptively control the parameter and used an elitist learning
strategy.
4) DMS-PSO [27], a variant of the fourth group, was proposed by Liang and Suganthan [27]. It is characterized
by a set of swarms with small sizes and these swarms
are frequently regrouped.
In summary, Table IV lists the different groups of discrete
versions of PSO and PSO variants.
IV. DPSO
In this section, a new DPSO for covering array generation
is presented. We firstly illustrate the weakness of CPSO with a
simple example. Then the representation scheme of a particle’s
velocity and the corresponding redefined operators are introduced. Finally, we give two auxiliary strategies to enhance the
performance of DPSO.
A. Example
In CPSO, a particle’s position represents a candidate test
case; its velocity, a real vector, represents the movement tendency of this particle in each dimension. This scheme is
meaningful in a continuous optimization problem, because
an optimal solution may exist near the current best particle’s
position. So it is desirable to move the particle to this area
for further search. This may not hold for covering array
generation.

Here, we use CA(N; 2, 34 ) as an example. Suppose that
three test cases (0, 1, 0, 1), (2, 1, 1, 2), and (1, 2, 0, 0) have
been generated and added to TS in Algorithm 1, and the fourth
one is to be generated according to CPSO. A possible candidate particle pi may have the position (0, 0, 0, 0) and velocity
(0.5, 0.6, −0.4, 0.2) with fitness value 4, and its individual
best position pbesti may be (0, 0, 1, 1) with fitness value 5.
The global best position gbest may be (0, 2, 2, 2) with fitness
value 6. According to the update (2), if we take ω = 0.9 and
c1 × r1 = c2 × r2 ≈ 0.65, in the next iteration, pi ’s velocity
may be transformed to (0.45, 1.84, 1.59, 2.13). Thus, pi moves
to the new position (0, 1, 1, 1) with a limitation on the velocity (the velocity is kept in [−i /2, i /2]), or (0, 1, 1, 2) with
no limitation. In both cases, pi only has fitness value 2 after
updating. When this occurs, pi evolves to a worse situation,
although its position is closer to the pbesti and gbest than its
original one.
Analyzing the fitness measurement, the main contribution
to the fitness value is the combinations that the test case can
cover, not the concrete “position” at which it is located. For
example, test case (2, 1, 1, 2) has a larger fitness value than
(0, 0, 0, 0) because it covers six new schemas [(2, 1, –, –),
(2, –, 1, –), (2, –, –, 2) etc.], not because of its relative distance
to other particles.
B. DPSO
To overcome this weakness, the movement of particles
should be modified. Inspired by the set-based representation scheme of velocity, DPSO is designed as a version of
S-PSO [18] to make the particle learn from the individual and
global best more effectively when generating covering arrays.
Unlike S-PSO, the element of the velocity set in DPSO is
designed for covering array generation, and DPSO does not
classify the velocity set into different dimensions to avoid the
inconsistency of different dimensions when updating velocities
in S-PSO.
In DPSO, a particle’s position represents a candidate test
case, while its velocity is changed to a set of t-way schemas
with probabilities. Other than the velocity’s representation and
the newly defined operators, the evolution procedure of DPSO
is the same as CPSO (Algorithm 2).
Definition 5 (Velocity): The velocity is a set of pairs
(s, p(s)), where s is a possible t-way schema of the covering
array and p(s) is a real number between 0 and 1 representing the probability of the selection of schema s to update the
current position.
In the initialization of the swarm, the particle’s position is
randomly assigned. Then Cnt possible different schemas are
selected randomly and each of them is assigned a random
probability p(s) ∈ (0, 1). These Cnt pairs form the initial velocity set of this particle; the size of this set changes dynamically
during the evaluation.
We consider the same example CA(N; 2, 34 ). In DPSO,
when particle pi is initialized, its position xi (k) may be
(0, 0, 0, 0) representing a candidate test case as before, and
its velocity vi (k) may be such a set {((1, 1, –, –), 0.7),
((0, –, 0, –), 0.3), ((–, 0, –, 1), 0.8), ((0, –, –, 2), 0.9),

pairs.
DPSO follows the conventional evolution procedure
(Algorithm 2) that uses (2) and (3) to update the velocity and
position of a particle. To adapt the new scheme for velocity
in Definition 5, the related operators in these equations must
be redefined.
1) Coefficient × Velocity: The coefficient is a real number
which may be a parameter or a random number. It modifies
all the probabilities in the velocity.
Definition 6 (Coefficient × Velocity): Let a be a nonnegative real number and v be a velocity, a × v = {(s, p(s) ×
a)|(s, p(s)) ∈ v}. (If p(s) × a > 1, p(s) × a = 1.)
For example, Fig. 1(a) shows the result for ω × vi (k) where
ω = 0.9.
2) Position–Position: The difference of two positions gives
the direction on which a particle moves. The results of the
minus operator is a set of (s, p(s)) pairs, as velocity.
Definition 7 (Position–Position): Let x1 and x2 be two positions. Then x1 − x2 = {(s, 0.5)|s is a schema that exists in x1
but not in x2 }.
In the newly generated schema, probability p(s) for s is
set to 0.5 so that the acceleration constants take similar
values in both CPSO and DPSO. As in (2), the result of
position–position is multiplied by ci × ri . In CPSO, ci is
often set to 2 and ri is a random number between 0 and 1
(recall Section II-C). In DPSO, we want the value of final
probability to have a range between 0 and 1 after multiplying
by ci . Setting p(s) to 0.5 puts the result in [0, 1] when ci = 2.
For example, suppose that xi (k) = (0, 0, 0, 0), pbesti =
(0, 0, 1, 1), and gbest = (0, 2, 2, 2) as before.
We can get pbesti − xi (k) = {((0, –, 1, –, –), 0.5),
((0, –, –, 1), 0.5), ((–, 0, 1, –), 0.5), ((–, 0, –, 1), 0.5),
((–, –, 1, 1), 0.5)}. Fig. 1(b) and (c) shows the results for
2×r1 ×(pbesti −xi (k)) and 2×r2 ×(gbest−xi (k)) respectively.
3) Velocity + Velocity: The addition of velocities gives a
particle’s movement path. The plus operator results in the
union of two velocities.
Definition 8 (Velocity + Velocity): Let v1 and v2 be two
velocities. Then v1 + v2 = {(s, p(s))| if (s, p1 (s)) ∈ v1 and
(s, p2 (s)) ∈ v2 , p(s) = p1 (s) + p2 (s); if (s, pi (s)) ∈ v1
and (s, pi (s)) ∈
/ v2 or (s, pi (s)) ∈ v2 and (s, pi (s)) ∈
/ v1 ,
p(s) = pi (s)}. (If p1 (s) + p2 (s) > 1, p1 (s) + p2 (s) = 1.)
For example, Fig. 1(d) shows the results for pi ’s new
velocity vi (k + 1) after updating velocity.

20: if γ < pro3 then
21:

22: end if
23: return xi (k + 1)

In the velocity-updating phase of DPSO (2), we introduce
a new parameter pro1 to control the size of the final velocity
set. If p(si ) < pro1 , the pair (si , p(si )) is removed from the
final velocity. For example, if we set pro1 = 0.5, vi (k + 1) is
removed as shown in Fig. 1(e). Here, the velocity has been
sorted in descending order of p(s), where if several p(s) have
the same value, they are in an arbitrary order. If vi (k + 1)
becomes empty, it stays empty until new pairs are added to
it. As long as the velocity is empty, the particle’s position is
not updated and no better solutions can be found from this
particle. In Section IV-C1, we discuss how to reinitialize this
particle.
4) Position+Velocity: Position plus velocity is the position
updating phase. Algorithm 3 gives the pseudo code of this
procedure. Here, two new parameters, pro2 and pro3 , numbers
in the range [0, 1], are introduced. pro2 is used to determine

582

IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON EVOLUTIONARY COMPUTATION, VOL. 19, NO. 4, AUGUST 2015

the probability of selecting each fixed level in schema s and
pro3 is a mutation probability to make the particle mutate
randomly.
An example helps to describe this procedure. We already
have pi ’s current position xi (k) = (0, 0, 0, 0), and its updated
velocity vi (k + 1) in descending order of p(s) as shown in
Fig. 1(e). We also assume that pro2 and pro3 are both set to
0.5. Each schema si here is selected to update the position
with probability p(si ). For the first pair ((0, –, –, 2), 1.0),
suppose that the random number α satisfies α < 1.0. Then,
for each fixed level of this pair, namely level 0 of the first
factor and level 2 of the fourth factor, its corresponding factor
has not been fixed in xi (k + 1). Suppose that we have the
first β < 0.5 but the second β > 0.5, the first factor will be
selected to update the position and the second factor will not.
So the new position becomes (0, –, –, –). For the second pair,
we regenerate the random number α, and compare it with the
probability 0.9. If α < 0.9, the second pair is selected. If we
generate β < 0.5 in two rounds, the new position becomes
(0, 2, 2, –). Accordingly, if the third pair is selected, and its
second factor’s level 0 is chosen to update, it does not change
position because this factor has been set to a fixed level 2.
This procedure is repeated until all factors in the new position
xi (k+1) are set to fixed levels. If all pairs in velocity have been
considered, unfixed factors of xi (k + 1) are filled by the same
levels of previous position xi (k). For example, after finishing
the For loop in line 15, if the fourth factor of xi (k + 1) has
not been given any level, the fourth factor of xi (k) is used to
update it. Then xi (k + 1) becomes (0, 2, 2, 0).
C. Auxiliary Strategies
Auxiliary strategies can be introduced to improve the performance of PSO. Two of them are added to DPSO: 1) particle
reinitialization to make the search more effective and 2) additional evaluation of gbest to improve the selection of the global
best test case.
1) Particle Reinitialization: The PSO algorithm starts with
a random distribution of particles, which finally converge.
Then the best position that has been found is returned. The
swarm may jump out of a local optimum, but this can not
be guaranteed because CPSO lacks specific strategies for this.
When applying PSO for covering array generation, increasing
the number of iterations does not improve the ability to escape
a local optimum. Hence, particle reinitialization, a widely used
method, is employed to help DPSO to jump out of the local
optimum.
The main issue with particle reinitialization is when to reinitialize the particle. We may select a threshold, so that the
reinitialization is done when the number of iterations exceeds
the threshold. In DPSO, a better method can be applied. Using
the new representation for velocity, when the current particle pi ’s position equals its individual best position pbesti
and global best position gbest, the size (norm) of pi ’s velocity reduces gradually, because no pairs are generated from
(pbesti − xi ) and (gbest − xi ), and the original pairs in velocity
are removed gradually under the influence of ω × v (reduce
the p(s) of original pairs) and parameter pro1 . After a few
fluctuations around gbest, the particle may stay at gbest, and

TABLE V
T WO D IFFERENT C ONSTRUCTIONS OF CA(N; 2, 34 )

its size (norm) of velocity is zero. We can use this scenario to
trigger reinitialization of the particle. When the reinitialization
is done, each dimension of a particle’s position is randomly
assigned a valid value, and its velocity is regenerated as in the
initialization of the swarm.
2) Additional Evaluation of gbest: Current PSO methods
to generate covering arrays generally employ the fitness function in Definition 4. This fitness function only focuses on
the current candidate, and does not consider the partial test
suite TS.
Consider the generation of CA(N; 2, 34 ). Table V shows two
different construction processes. Both constructions generate
(0, 0, 0, 0) as the first test case. Then they choose different test
cases, but each of the first three reaches the largest number of
newly covered combinations, C42 = 6. The difference between
these two constructions emerges when generating the fourth
test case. In Construction 1, because the combinations with the
same level between any two factors have all been covered, we
cannot find a new test case that can still cover six combinations. However, in Construction 2, such a new test case can be
found, (1, 0, 1, 2). Because the minimum size of CA(N; 2, 34 )
is 9, each test case is required to cover six new combinations.
Thus, Construction 1 cannot generate the minimum test suite,
but Construction 2 can.
In general, there may exist multiple test cases with the same
highest fitness value, which make them equally qualified to be
gbest in Algorithm 2. Instead of arbitrarily selecting one as
gbest, it is better to apply additional distance metric to select
one among them. As shown in Table V, if the new test case
is similar to the existing tests [as (0, 1, 1, 1) is closer to
(0, 0, 0, 0) than (1, 1, 1, 1)], there may be a better chance to
find test cases with larger fitness subsequently.
In order to measure the “similarity” between a test case t
and an existing test suite TS, we use the average Hamming
distance. The Hamming distance d12 indicates the number of
factors that have different levels between two test cases t1 and
t2 . Hence, the similarity between t and TS can be defined by
the average Hamming distance
H(t, TS) =

1 
dtk .
|TS|

(4)

k∈TS

The new gbest selection strategy selects the best candidate gbest based on two metrics. A test case that has the
minimum average Hamming distance (i.e., the maximum similarity) from the set of test cases that all have the same highest
fitness value is selected as gbest in Algorithm 2. For example, when we generate the second test case for CA(N; 2, 34 )
in Table V, although (1, 1, 1, 1) and (0, 1, 1, 1) both have
the highest fitness value 6, (0, 1, 1, 1) is selected as gbest

WU et al.: A DISCRETE PARTICLE SWARM OPTIMIZATION FOR COVERING ARRAY GENERATION

583

TABLE VI
C OMPARING P ERFORMANCE B ETWEEN CPSO AND DPSO

because its average Hamming distance, 3, is smaller than that
of (1, 1, 1, 1), 4. We expect that this additional evaluation can
enhance the probability of generating a smaller test suite. In
addition, because we still want to make the particle follow the
conventional search behavior on the individual best direction,
this additional distance metric will not be used in updating the
pbest of DPSO.
V. E VALUATION AND PARAMETER T UNING
In this section, we first evaluate the effectiveness of DPSO
in some representative cases, and compare the results against
CPSO. Then the optimal parameter settings for both CPSO
and DPSO are explored. The goal of evaluation and parameter
tuning is to make the size of generated covering array as small
as possible. Five representative cases of covering arrays, listed
below, are selected for our experiments
CA1 (N; 2, 610 )

CA2 (N; 3, 57 )

CA3 (N; 4, 39 )

CA4 (N; 2, 43 53 62 ) VCA(N; 2, 315 , CA(3, 34 )).
We consider four independent parameters, iteration number
(iter), population size (size), inertia weight (ω), and acceleration constant (c), which play similar roles in both CPSO
and DPSO, and three new parameters for DPSO, pro1 , pro2 ,
and pro3 . We carry out a base choice experiment to study the
impact of various values of these parameters on CPSO and
DPSO’s performance and find the recommended settings for
them. First, a base setting is chosen as the basic configuration. Then the value of each parameter is changed to create
a series of configurations, while leaving the other parameters
unchanged. Initially, we set iter = 50, size = 20, ω = 0.9,
c = 1.3, and pro1 = pro2 = pro3 = 0.5 as a basic configuration based on the previous studies [13], [16] and our
empirical experience. To obtain statistically significant results,
the generation of each case of covering array is executed
30 times.
A. Evaluation of DPSO
We compare the performance between CPSO and DPSO
with the basic configuration. Five classes of covering arrays
are generated by these two algorithms. The sizes obtained and
average execution time per test case are shown as CPSO1 and
DPSO in Table VI. The best and mean array sizes of DPSO are
all better than those of CPSO1 . The new discrete representation scheme and auxiliary strategies improve PSO for covering
array generation.
DPSO can produce smaller covering arrays than CPSO with
the basic configuration. However, DPSO spends more time

during the evolution, because its new operators for updating
are more intricate than the conventional ones. DPSO needs
to deal with many elements of the velocity set, whereas the
conventional scheme only needs simple arithmetic operations.
To compare the performance between CPSO and DPSO given
the same execution time, for each case we let the execution
time per test case for CPSO equal to that for DPSO, so that
CPSO can spend more time in searching. We refer to this
version of CPSO as CPSO2 . In addition, a t-test between
CPSO2 and DPSO is conducted and the corresponding p-value
is presented. A p-value smaller than 0.05 indicates that the performance of these two algorithms is statistically different with
95% confidence.
From CPSO1 , CPSO2 , and DPSO in Table VI, the performance of CPSO is improved with more search time. DPSO,
which must use fewer iterations, still works better than CPSO.
The effectiveness of DPSO comes from the essential improvement of its new representation scheme for velocity and the
auxiliary strategies. The results of the t-test demonstrate the
significance of these differences. Therefore, we can conclude
that DPSO performs better than CPSO with fewer iterations
for covering array generation.
B. Parameter Tuning
In the base choice experiment, because the sizes of the various covering arrays differ, the mean size of each case (si )
obtained is normalized using
si =

si − smin
.
smax − smin

This normalization enables the graphical representation of
different cases on a common scale.
Because some parameters may not significantly impact the
performance, we use ANOVA (significance level = 0.05) to
test whether there exist significant differences among the mean
results obtained by different parameter settings. When changing the parameter settings have no significant impact on the
generation results, these results will be presented as dotted
lines in the corresponding figures. For example, CA4 is presented as a dotted line in Fig. 2(b). It means that the iteration
number does not significantly impact the generation of this
case of covering array, and so this case will not be further
considered when identifying the optimal settings.
1) Iteration Number (iter): Iteration number determines the
number of updates. PSO typically requires thousands of iterations to evolve. Nevertheless, only a few iterations are required
to generate covering array according to [14]–[16]. So we

change its value from 50, the base setting, to 1950 incrementally. Much larger values are not used because the execution
time may increase markedly without a commensurate increase
in the quality of the results.
Fig. 2 shows the results for different choices of iteration numbers, where each line represents a covering array.
Performance is improved with increasing iterations for both
CPSO and DPSO. A small number of iterations may not be
appropriate due to insufficient searching. Because the optimal
settings are different among different cases, and several settings can be chosen to generate the minimum covering arrays,
it is open to debate which setting is the “best” one. Given
time constraints, for a population size of 20, a good setting
of iteration number could be approximately 1000 for both
CPSO and DPSO.
2) Population Size (Size): Population size determines the
initial search space. Generally a small value, e.g., 20, is satisfactory for most cases. A large population size may bring a
higher diversity and find a better solution, but it also increases
the evolving time. For the same reason as before, we change
the value of population size from 10 to 100.

Fig. 3 shows the results for different choices of population size. There is no doubt that the mean array size obtained
decreases as population size increases. A large population size
can have more chances to generate smaller covering arrays, but
its execution time can become prohibitive.
In addition, because iteration number and population size
together determine the search effort of PSO, we explore the
combinations between these two parameters. We let iter × size
be a constant 20 000, and generate each case under different
settings of these two parameters. Fig. 4 shows the results,
where PSO prefers a relatively larger population size. In
CPSO, ten particles with 2000 iterations is the worst setting,
and most cases produce good results with 60 or 80 particles.
In DPSO, the best choice of population size is still 80. In
both CPSO and DPSO, the largest population size 100 cannot
produce as good results as that of 80 due to having fewer iterations. So achieving smallest covering arrays requires a good
balance between these two parameters, and a moderately large
population size is necessary for both CPSO and DPSO. Thus,
we can set iteration number to 250, and population size to 80,
as the recommended settings for both CPSO and DPSO.

3) Inertia Weight (ω): Inertia weight determines the tendency of the particle to continue in the same direction. A
small value help the particle move primarily toward the best
position, while a large one is helpful to continue its previous
movement. A linearly decreasing value is also used as it can
make the swarm gradually narrow the search space. Here, we
investigate both fixed values and a linearly decreasing value
from 0.9 to 0.4 over the whole evolution (presented as “dec”).
Fig. 5 shows the results for different choices of inertia
weight. In CPSO, most of the smallest covering arrays are
generated by large fixed inertia weights. The decreasing value
does not perform as well as the large values, such as 0.9 for
CA1 , CA2 , and CA4 . So 0.9 can be the recommended choice
for CPSO. In DPSO, 1.1 is the worst choice because the particle may update its position based on its own velocity and
thus fail to learn from individual and global best positions.
The decreasing value can perform reasonably well, but a fixed
value 0.5 may be a better choice in that it keeps the effort of
global search moderate. Thus, we can recommend the fixed
inertia weight of 0.9 for CPSO, and 0.5 for DPSO.
4) Acceleration Constant (c): Acceleration Constants
c1 and c2 control the learning from pbest and gbest, respectively. Generally, they are set to the same value to balance

TABLE VII
R ECOMMENDED PARAMETER S ETTINGS

the influence of these two positions. Setting c1 and c2 to a
large value may make the particle more likely attracted to the
best position ever found, while a small one may make the
search far from the current optimal region. In this paper, we
set c1 = c2 = c, and vary c from 0.1 to 2.9.
Fig. 6 shows the results for different choices of acceleration
constant. Unlike other parameters, there is a consistent trend in
all five cases. In CPSO, the values larger than 0.5 all produce
good results. In DPSO, 1.3 can definitely be regarded as the
optimal value. Thus, we set 1.3 as the recommended value of
acceleration constant for both CPSO and DPSO.
5) pro1 , pro2 , and pro3 : These three parameters are new to
DPSO. Parameter pro1 determines the size of the final velocity. As those pairs whose probabilities are smaller than pro1
are removed from the final velocity set, a small value may
keep more pairs in the velocity for the next evolution, but it

also requires more computation time. Parameter pro2 determines the probability of selecting each fixed level from each
schema when updating positions. A larger value may lead to
a quick construction of new position, but it may also lead
to fast convergence toward a local optimum. Parameter pro3
determines the mutation probability when updating positions.
A larger value may enhance the randomness, but it also lowers
the convergence speed. In this paper, values from 0.1 to 1.0
for these three parameters are investigated.
Fig. 7 shows the results. For pro1 , a large value is not
appropriate because it removes nearly all pairs from the final
velocity set. A medium value 0.5, which appears to lead to the
best result, may be the best choice. For pro2 , the smallest value
0.1 yields the best results. Slower construction of the new position may slow the convergence toward a local optimum, but it
also takes longer. So, in order to balance performance and execution time, we take 0.3 as the recommended value for pro2 .
For pro3 , a larger value may be a good choice. The frequent
mutation of new position may bring better results, but also
takes longer to converge. So, we take 0.7 as the recommended
value for pro3 .
In summary, the recommended parameter settings for PSO
for covering array generation are different from previously
suggested ones [13], [16]. Some parameters may significantly
impact the performance in some cases, and parameter tuning is necessary to enhance heuristic techniques for particular
applications. Naturally, the optimal settings vary for different cases of covering arrays. There may not exist a common
setting that can always lead to the best results. Because it is

impractical to tune parameters for each case in real life, we
suggest two general settings for CPSO and DPSO, as shown
in Table VII, which can typically lead to better performance
within reasonable execution time.
VI. C OMPARING A MONG PSO S
In this section, we compare the best reported array sizes
generated by PSO in [16] with our findings for CPSO, DPSO,
and four representative variants. Because the research in [16]
demonstrated that their generation results typically outperform
greedy algorithms, in this paper, we do not compare CPSO and
DPSO with greedy algorithms.
We implement both the original and discrete versions of
four variants (TVAC [24], CLPSO [25], APSO [26], and
DMS-PSO [27]) to generate covering arrays. Their discrete
versions are extended based on new representation scheme of
velocity and auxiliary strategies. We name them D-TVAC, DCLPSO, D-APSO, and D-DMS-PSO, respectively. In CLPSO,
a particle can learn from different particles’ pbest in each
dimension whereas we do not distinguish dimensions strictly
in DPSO. So in D-CLPSO, a particle can fully learn from
different particles’ pbest in all dimensions. That may weaken
the search ability of CLPSO. For the other three variants, they
can be directly extended based on DPSO.
All algorithms are compared using the same number of
fitness function evaluations. CPSO and DPSO use the recommended settings shown in Table VII. For the variants, iter,
size and pro1 , pro2 and pro3 for discrete versions are set to

their recommended values. ω and c are also set to recommended values unless they are adaptively adjusted during the
evolution, in which case their range is set to [0.4, 0.9] and
[0.8, 1.8], respectively. The new control parameters for these
variants follow their suggested settings.
Tables VIII–XIII give the results. Because of the execution
time, we only consider covering strengths from 2 to 4, and the
generation of each covering array is repeated 30 times. A t-test
(significance level = 0.05) is also conducted to test whether
there exists a significant difference between the mean sizes
produced by the two algorithms. In the first three columns, we
report the best and mean array sizes obtained from previous
results, CPSO and DPSO, where boldface numbers indicate
that the difference between CPSO and DPSO is significant
based on the t-test. In the last four columns, we report the mean
array sizes from the original and discrete versions of each PSO
variant (presented as meanc and meand respectively), where
boldface numbers indicate that the difference between meanc
and meand of each variant is significant.
A. Uniform Covering Arrays
Tables VIII–X present the results for uniform covering
arrays. We extend the cases considered in [16], where “–”
indicates the not available cases. In Tables VIII, we report
array sizes for n factors, each having three levels. In
Tables IX and X, we report array sizes for 7 and 10 factors,
each having  levels. Their covering strengths all range from
2 to 4.
Typically, CPSO can produce smaller sizes than those
reported in [16], demonstrating the effectiveness of parameter tuning. Furthermore, DPSO can produce the smallest best
and mean sizes in almost all cases, and usually the performance of DPSO is significantly better than CPSO. When the
covering strength t = 2 is adopted (Table VIII), DPSO does

not generally outperform CPSO. But when covering strength
increases, DPSO performs better. Sometimes the mean sizes
for DPSO are smaller than the best sizes for CPSO. Because
generating a covering array with higher covering strength is
more complicated, DPSO may be more appropriate for generating such covering arrays. In Tables IX and X, we also find
that DPSO is superior for covering arrays with high covering strength. Overall, these results show the effectiveness of
DPSO for uniform covering array generation.
Surprisingly, DPSO does not beat previous results for
CPSO when covering arrays have two levels for each factor
(Table IX). This appears to be a weakness of DPSO. Although
DPSO generates smaller covering arrays than previous results
and CPSO, other techniques may still yield better results than
DPSO (some best known sizes can be found in [38]).
B. VS Covering Array
Tables XI–XIII give the results for VS covering arrays.
Based on CA(N; 2, 315 ), CA(N; 3, 315 ), and CA(N; 2, 42 52 63 ),
some different cases of sub covering arrays conducted in [16]
are examined. Their covering strengths are at most 4.
Generally, we can draw similar conclusions as for uniform
covering arrays. CPSO with the suggested parameter setting
can produce better results than reported sizes in some cases.
DPSO also usually beats them on the best and mean sizes.
In Table XI, often the difference between CPSO and DPSO
is not significant. In part this is because for the CA(3, 33 ),
CA(3, 33 )2 , CA(3, 33 )3 , and CA(4, 34 ), the same best results
are provably the minimum (e.g., the minimum size of the
CA(3, 33 ) is 3 × 3 × 3 = 27). For the other cases, although
sometimes the difference is not significant, DPSO can still generate smaller covering arrays. DPSO remains a good choice
for generating VS covering arrays. In Tables XII and XIII,
similar results can be found.

For both uniform and variable cases of covering arrays,
parameter tuning can enhance CPSO to generate smaller covering arrays than previous work. DPSO can produce the smallest
covering arrays in nearly all cases, and in general the difference of performance between CPSO and DPSO is significant.
DPSO is an effective discrete version of PSO for covering
array generation.
C. PSO Variants
In order to further investigate the effectiveness of DPSO for
covering array generation, we implement the original versions
of four representative variants of PSO and extend them to their
discrete versions based on DPSO. We apply them to generate

the same cases for covering arrays. The mean sizes obtained
are shown in the last four columns in Tables VIII–XIII.
We first compare the mean sizes of original PSO variants
with those of CPSO and DPSO. In our experiments, TVAC’s
mean sizes are always larger than CPSO’s. The linear adjustment of inertia weight and acceleration constant is not helpful
for CPSO for covering array generation. Typically, APSO’s
mean sizes are also larger than CPSO’s. Because APSO uses
a fuzzy system to classify different evolutionary states, its
ineffectiveness may result from inappropriate parameter settings. CLPSO and DMS-PSO can outperform CPSO typically.
Although on occasion they achieve comparable performance
with DPSO, they cannot perform as well as DPSO in most

cases. That further demonstrates the effectiveness of DPSO
for covering array generation. Because these four algorithms
are representative PSO variants (as shown in Table IV), designing different neighborhood topologies and using multiswarm
techniques may have potential to improve CPSO for covering
array generation.
We next compare the original and discrete versions of each
variant. Except for CLPSO, the other three variants can be
improved using their discrete versions, and the improvement
is also significant. TVAC cannot outperform CPSO, but it
is enhanced by DPSO so that D-TVAC can produce smaller
mean sizes than CPSO in most cases. The linear adjustment
is helpful for the discrete version. For CLPSO, only in a few
cases is it improved by DPSO. Sometimes D-CLPSO even
leads to worse results (see Table X), due primarily to the
weakened search ability of its discrete version as explained in
Section VI. For APSO, DPSO can enhance its original version,
but D-APSO is still worse than DPSO. That may result from
inappropriate settings as explained before. For DMS-PSO,
sometimes DPSO does not enhance it (see Table XI).
However, in most cases D-DMS-PSO can outperform
DMS-PSO and has comparable performance with D-TVAC.
The multiswarm strategy is also helpful for the discrete
version.

In summary, the comparison study reveals that our suggested parameter settings are more suitable for covering array
generation. DPSO is an effective discrete version of PSO.
It can significantly outperform previous results and CPSO
in nearly all cases for uniform and VS covering arrays.
Furthermore, DPSO’s representation scheme of a particle’s
velocity and auxiliary strategies not only enhance CPSO, but
also typically enhance PSO variants. DPSO is a promising
improvement on PSO for covering array generation.
VII. C OMPARING DPSO W ITH GA AND ACO
Because GAs and ACO [8]–[12] have also been successfully
used for covering array generation, we compare CPSO and
DPSO with the reported array sizes in [9] and [11]. There are
no widely accepted benchmarks for the comparison of searchbased covering array generation, so we only consider these
two representative and competitive works.
Shiba et al. [9] applied both GA and ACO to generate
uniform covering arrays (CA1 to CA8 in Table XIV), and
Chen et al. [11] applied ACO to generate VS covering arrays
(VCA9 to VCA12 in Table XIV). They both set algorithm
parameters according to recommendations in related research
fields without parameter tuning, while our CPSO and DPSO

590

IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON EVOLUTIONARY COMPUTATION, VOL. 19, NO. 4, AUGUST 2015

use the recommended settings shown in Table VII. To compare
these algorithms under the same number of fitness evaluations, for each case of covering array, the population size and
the number of iterations of CPSO and DPSO are modified
accordingly to satisfy the settings in [9] and [11]. Moreover,
Shiba et al. [9] and Chen et al. [11] both applied test minimization algorithms to further reduce the size of generated
covering arrays, while our CPSO and DPSO do not apply any
minimization algorithms.
Table XIV shows the comparison results, where boldface
numbers indicate the best array sizes obtained, and “–” represents that the corresponding data is not available. The
generation of each case of covering array of CPSO and DPSO
is executed 30 times and the best and average results are
presented. Because we do not implement GA and ACO for
covering array generation, no statistical tests can be conducted
here. In addition, because the platforms used for collecting the
results differ, the comparison of computational time would not
be informative. We nevertheless present the execution times
of our CPSO and DPSO, which can serve as references for
practitioners.
From Table XIV, DPSO can outperform existing GA and
ACO for covering array generation, despite the latter two
applying test minimization algorithms. Because our DPSO is
a version of PSO designed and tuned for covering array generation, it suggests that tuned versions of GAs and ACOs may
be a promising area for further study. In addition, CPSO performs worse than GA and ACO in seven of 12 cases. That
may result from the improvement by minimization algorithms
in [9] and [11]. But for CA2 , CA3 , and CA6 , CPSO can still
achieve smaller covering arrays.
In summary, the results further demonstrate that DPSO is
an effective discrete version of PSO for covering array generation. Further investigations of tuned versions of GA and ACO
should be considered.
VIII. C ONCLUSION
Covering array generation is a key issue in CT. We developed a new DPSO for covering array generation, by adapting
S-PSO to generate covering arrays and incorporating two
auxiliary strategies to improve the performance. Parameter tuning was applied to both CPSO and DPSO to identify their
best parameter settings. The original and discrete versions of
four representative PSO variants were implemented and their
efficacy for covering array generation was compared. The performance of DPSO was also compared with other existing
evolutionary algorithms, GA and ACO.
DPSO can perform better than CPSO with fewer iterations, and the performance of CPSO and DPSO is significantly
impacted by their parameter settings. Different cases require
different parameter settings; there may not exist a single choice
that leads to the best results. After parameter tuning, we identified two recommended settings, which lead to relatively good
performance for CPSO and DPSO. Indeed, CPSO with our recommended parameter settings improves on previously reported
results, and our DPSO with recommended parameter settings usually beats CPSO. Typically, DPSO also significantly

enhances the performance of PSO variants. In addition, DPSO
often outperforms GA and ACO to generate covering arrays.
Consequently, DPSO is a promising improvement of PSO for
covering array generation.
Improvements on the methods here may be possible in
a number of ways. One would be to investigate further
evolution procedures and strategies proposed in PSO, such
as hybridizing with penalty approaches to handle discrete
unknowns [39], and compare the results with some exact
schemes like branch and bound method. A second would be
to examine one-column-at-a-time approaches or methods that
construct the entire array, rather than the one-row-at-a-time
approach adopted here. A third would be to incorporate
DPSO with other methods, in particular with test minimization
methods.

Abstract—This paper proposes a new algebraic system, Test
Algebra (T A), for identifying faults in combinatorial testing for
SaaS (Software-as-a-Service) applications. SaaS as a part of cloud
computing is a new software delivery model, and mission-critical
applications are composed, deployed, and executed in cloud
platforms. Testing SaaS applications is a challenging task because
new applications need to be tested when they are composed
before they can be deployed for execution. Combinatorial testing
algorithms can be used to identify faulty configurations and
interactions from 2-way all the way to k-way where k is the
number of components in the application. The T A defines rules
to identify faulty configurations and interactions. Using the rules
defined in the T A, a collection of configurations can be tested
concurrently in different servers and in any order and the results
obtained will be still same due to the algebraic constraints.
Index Terms—Combinatorial testing, algebra, SaaS

I. I NTRODUCTION
Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) is a new software delivery
model. SaaS often supports three features: customization,
multi-tenancy architecture (MTA), and scalability. MTA means
using one code base to develop multiple tenant applications,
and each tenant application essentially is a customization
of the base code [12]. A SaaS system often also supports
scalability as it can supply additional computing resources
when the workload is heavy. Tenants’ applications are often
customized by using components stored in the SaaS database
[14], [1], [11] including GUI, workflow, service, and data
components.
Once tenant applications are composed, they need to be tested, but a SaaS system can have millions of components, and
hundreds of thousands of tenant applications. Testing tenant
applications becomes a challenge as new tenant applications
and components are added into the SaaS system continuously.
New tenant applications are added on a daily basis while other
tenant applications are running on the SaaS platform. As new
tenant applications are composed, new components are added
into the SaaS system. Each tenant application represents a
customer for the SaaS system, and thus it needs to be tested.
Combinatorial testing is a popular testing technique to test
an application with different configurations. It often assumes
that each component within a configuration has been tested

already, but interactions among components in the configuration may cause failures. Traditional combinatorial testing
techniques often focus on test case generation to detect the
presence of faults, but fault location is an active research area.
Each configuration needs to be tested, as each configuration
represents a tenant application. Traditional combinatorial testing such as AETG [2] can reveal the existence of faults by
using few test cases to support t-way coverage for t ≥ 2. But
knowing the existence of a fault does not indicate which tway interactions are faulty. When the problem size is small,
an engineer can identify faults. However, when the problem
is large, it can be a challenge to identify faults.
As the IT industries moves to Big Data and cloud computing where hundreds of thousand processors are available,
potentially, a large number of processors with distributed
databases can be used to perform large-scale combinatorial testing. Furthermore, they also provide concurrent and
asynchronous computing mechanisms such as MapReduce,
automated redundancy and recovery management, automated
resource provisioning, and automated migration for scalability.
These capabilities provide significant computing power that
was not available before. One simple way of performing
combinatorial testing in a cloud environment is:
1) Partition the testing tasks;
2) Allocate these testing tasks to different processors in the
cloud platform for test execution;
3) Collect results done by these processors.
However, this is not efficient as while the number of computing
and storage resources have increased significantly, the number
of combinations to be considered is still too high. For example,
a large SaaS system may have millions of components, and
testing all of these combinations can still consume all the
resources in a cloud platform. Two ways to improve this
approach and both are based on learning from the previous
test results:
•

•

Devise a mechanism to merge test results from different
processors so that testing results can be merged quickly,
and detect any inconsistency in testing;
Based on the existing testing results, eliminate any con-

figurations or interactions from future testing.
Due to the asynchronous and autonomous nature of cloud
computing, test results may arrive asynchronously and autonomously, and this necessitates a new testing framework.
This paper proposes a new algebraic system, Test Algebra
(TA), to facilitate concurrent combinatorial testing. The key
feature of TA is that the algebraic rules follow the combinatorial structure, and thus can track the test results obtained. The
TA can then be used to determine whether a tenant application
is faulty, and which interactions need to be tested. The TA
is an algebraic system in which elements and operations are
formally defined. Each element represents a unique component
in the SaaS system, and a set of components represents a
tenant application. Assuming each component has been tested
by developers, testing a tenant application is equivalent to
ensuring that there is no t-way interaction faults for t ≥ 2
among the elements in a set.
The TA uses the principle that if a t-way interaction is
faulty, every (t + 1)-way interaction that contains the t-way
interaction as a subset is necessarily faulty. The TA provides
guidance for the testing process based on test results so far.
Each new test result may indicate if additional tests are needed
to test a specific configuration. The TA is an algebraic system,
primarily intended to track the test results without knowing
how these results were obtained. Specifically, it does not
record the execution sequence of previously executed test
cases. Because of this, it is possible to allocate different
configurations to different processors for execution in parallel
or in any order, and the test results are merged following
the TA rules. The execution order and the merge order do
not affect the merged results if the merging follows the TA
operation rules.
This paper is structured as follows: Section II discusses the
related work; Section III proposes TA and shows its details;
and Section IV concludes this paper. Appendix provides proofs
of TA associativity properties.
II. R ELATED W ORK
SaaS testing is a new research topic [14], [4], [10]. Using
policies and metadata, test cases can be generated to test
SaaS applications. Testing can be embedded in the cloud
platform where tenant applications are run [14]. Gao proposed
a framework for testing cloud applications [4], and proposed
a scalability measure for testing cloud application scalability.
Another scalability measure was proposed by [10].
Testing all combinations of inputs and preconditions is not
feasible, even with a simple product [6], [8]. The number
of defects in a software product can be large, and defects
occurring infrequently are difficult to find [15]. Combinatorial
test design is used to identify a small number of tests needed
to get the coverage of important combinations. Combinatorial
test design methods enable one to build structure variation
into test cases for having greater test coverage with fewer test
cases.
Determining the presence of faults caused by a small
number of interacting elements has been extensively studied

in component-based software testing. When interactions are
to be examined, testing involves a combination-based strategy
[5]. When every interaction among t or fewer elements is to
be tested, methods have been developed that provide pairwise
or t-way coverage. Among the early methods, AET G [2]
popularized greedy one-test-at-a-time methods for constructing
test suites. In the literature, the test suite is usually called a
covering array, defined as follows. Suppose that there are k
configurable elements, numbered from 1 to k. Suppose that
for element c, there are vc valid options. A t-way interaction
is a selection of t of the k configurable elements, and a valid
option for each. A test selects a valid option for every element,
and it covers a t-way interaction if, when one restricts the
attention to the t selected elements, each has the same option
in the interaction as it does in the test.
A covering array of strength t is a collection of tests so
that every t-way interaction is covered by at least one of the
tests. Covering arrays reveal faults that arise from improper
interaction of t or fewer elements [9]. There are numerous
computational and mathematical approaches for construction
of covering arrays with a number of tests as small as possible
[3], [7].
If a t-way interaction causes a fault, then executing all
tests of a covering array will reveal the presence of at least
one faulty interaction. SaaS testing is interested in identifying
those interactions that are faulty including their numbers and
locations, as faulty configurations cannot be used in tenant
applications. Furthermore, the number and location of faults
keep on changing as new components can be added into
the SaaS database continuously. By then executing each test,
certain interactions are known not to be faulty, while others
appear only in tests that reveal faults, and hence may be faulty.
At this point, a classification tree analysis builds decision trees
for characterizing possible sets of faults. This classification
analysis is then used either to permit a system developer to
focus on a small collection of possible faults, or to design
additional tests to further restrict the set of possible faults.
In [16], empirical results demonstrate the effectiveness of
this strategy at limiting the possible faulty interactions to a
manageable number. Assuming that interactions of more than
t elements do not produce faults, a covering array can use few
tests to certify that no fault arises from a t-way interaction.
The Adaptive Reasoning algorithm (AR) is a strategy to
detect faults in SaaS [13]. The algorithm uses earlier test
results to generate new test cases to detect faults in tenant
applications. It uses three principles:
•

•

•

Principle 1: When a tenant application (or configuration)
fails the testing, there is at least one fault (but there may
be more) in the tenant configuration.
Principle 2: When a tenant application passes the testing,
there is no fault in the tenant configuration resulting
from a t-way interactions among components in the
configuration.
Principle 3: Whenever a configuration contains one or
more faulty interactions, it is faulty.

III. T EST A LGEBRA
Let C be a finite set of components. A configuration is
a subset T ⊆ C. One is concerned with determining the
operational status of configurations. To do this, one can
execute certain tests; every test is a configuration, but there
may be restrictions on which configurations can be used as
tests. If a certain test can be executed, its execution results in
an outcome of passed (operational) or failed (faulty).
When a test execution yields result, all configurations that
are subsets of the test are operational. However, when a test
execution yields a faulty result, one only knows that at least
one subset causes the fault, but it is unclear which of these
subsets caused the failure. Among a set of configurations that
may be responsible for faults, the objective is to determine,
which cause faults and which do not. To do this, one must
identify the set of candidates to be faulty. Because faults
are expected to arise from an interaction among relatively
few components, one considers t-way interactions. The t-way
interactions are It = {U ⊆ C : |U | = t}. Hence the goal is to
select tests, so that from the execution results of these tests,
one can ascertain the status of all t-way interactions for some
fixed small value of t.
Because interactions and configurations are represented as
subsets, one can use set-theoretic operations such as union, and
their associated algebraic properties such as commutativity,
associativity, and self-absorption. The structure of subsets and
supersets also plays a key role.
To permit this classification, one can use a valuation function V , so that for every subset S of components, V (S)
indicates the current knowledge about the operational status
consistent with the components in S. The focus is on determining V (S) whenever S is an interaction in I1 ∪ · · · ∪ It .
These interactions can have one of five states.
• Infeasible (X): For certain interactions, it may happen
that no feasible test is permitted to contain this interaction. For example, it may be infeasible to select two GUI
components in one configuration such that one says the
wall is GREEN but the other says RED.
• Faulty (F): If the interaction has been found to be faulty.
• Operational (P): Among the rest, if an interaction has
appeared in a test whose execution gave an operational
result, the interaction cannot be faulty.
• Irrelevant (N): For some feasible interactions, it may
be the case that certain interactions are not expected to
arise, so while it is possible to run a test containing the
interaction, there is no requirement to do so.
• Unknown (U): If neither of these occurs then the status
of the interaction is required but not currently known.
Any given stage of testing, an interaction has one of five
possible status indicators. These five status indicators are
ordered by X  F  P  N  U under a relation , and
it has a natural interpretation to be explained in a moment.
A. Learning from Previous Test Results
The motivation for developing an algebra is to automate
the deduction of the status of an interaction from the status

of tests and other interactions, particularly in combining the
status of two interactions. Specifically, one is often interested
in determining V (T1 ∪ T2 ) from V (T1 ) and V (T2 ). To do this,
a binary operation ⊗ on {X, F, P, N, U} can be defined, with
operation table as follows:
⊗
X
F
P
N
U

X
X
X

F
F
F

P
X
F
U
N
U

N
X
F
N
N
N

U
X
F
U
N
U

Using this definition, one can verify that the binary operation ⊗ has the following properties of commutativity and
associativity.
V (T1 ) ⊗ V (T2 ) = V (T2 ) ⊗ V (T1 ),
V (T1 ) ⊗ (V (T2 ) ⊗ V (T3 )) = (V (T1 ) ⊗ V (T2 )) ⊗ V (T3 ).
Using this operation, one observes that V (T1 ∪ T2 ) 
V (T1 ) ⊗ V (T2 ). It follows that
1) Every superset of an infeasible interaction is infeasible.
2) Every superset of a failed interaction is failed or infeasible.
3) Every superset of an irrelevant interaction is irrelevant,
failed, passed, or infeasible.
A set S is an X-implicant if V (S) = X but whenever
S 0 ⊂ S, V (S 0 ) ≺ X. The X-implicants provide a compact
representation for all interactions that are infeasible. Indeed
for any interaction T that contains an X-implicant, V (T ) = X.
Furthermore, a set S is an F-implicant if V (S) = F but
whenever S 0 ⊂ S, V (S 0 ) ≺ F. For any interaction T that
contains an F-implicant, V (T )  F. In the same way, a set S is
an N-implicant if V (S) = N but whenever S 0 ⊂ S, V (S 0 ) = U.
For any interaction T that contains an N-implicant, V (T )  N.
An analogous statement holds for passed interactions, but here
the implication is for subsets. A set S is a P-implicant if
V (S) = P but whenever S 0 ⊃ S, V (S 0 )  F. For any
interaction T that is contained in a P-implicant, V (T ) = P.
Implicants are defined with respect to the current knowledge
about the status of interactions. When a t-way interaction is
known to be infeasible, failed, or irrelevant, it must contain
an X-, F-, or N-implicant. By repeatedly proceeding from tway to (t + 1)-way interactions, then, one avoids the need
for any tests for (t + 1)-way interactions that contain any
infeasible, failed, or irrelevant t-way interaction. Hence testing
typically proceeds by determining the status of the 1-way
interactions, then proceeding to 2-way, 3-way, and so on.
The operation ⊗ is useful in determining the implied status
of (t + 1)-way interactions from the computed results for
t-way interactions, by examining unions of the t-way and
smaller interactions and determining implications of the rule
that V (T1 ∪ T2 )  V (T1 ) ⊗ V (T2 ). Moreover, when adding
further interactions to consider, all interactions previously
tested that passed are contained in a P-implicant, and every
(t + 1) interaction contained in one of these interactions can
be assigned status P.

For example, V (a, b) = P, V (a, e) = X, and other 2way interactions exist as atomic interaction in TA. Based
on the defined ⊗ operation, values of t-way interactions can
be deduced from the atomic interactions and their contained
interactions, such as V (a, b, e)  V (a, b) ⊗ V (a, e) = X, i.e.
V (a, b, e) = X.
The 3-way interaction (a, b, c) can have inferred results from
2-way interactions (a, b), (a, c), (b, c). If any contained 2-way
interaction has value F, the determining value of 3-way is F,
without further testing needed. But if all values of contained
2-way interactions are P, (a, b, c) the interaction needs to be
tested. In this case, U needs to be changed to non-U such as F
or P, assuming the 3-way is not X or N.
B. Changing Test Result Status
When testing a configuration with n components, one
should test individual components, 2-way interactions, 3-way
interactions, all the way to n-way interactions. Since any
combination of interactions is relevant in this case, the status
of any interaction can be either X, F, P, or U. The status of a
configuration is determined by the status of all interactions.
1) If an interaction has status X (F), the configuration has
status X (F).
2) If all interactions have status P, the configuration has
status P.
3) If some interactions still have status U, further tests are
needed.
It is important to determine when an interaction with status
U can be deduced to have status F or P instead. It can never
obtain status X or N once having had status U.
To change U to P: An interaction is assigned status P if and
only if it is a subset of a test that leads to proper operation.
To change U to F: Consider the candidate T , one can
conclude that V (T ) = F if there is a test containing T that
yields a failed result, but for every other candidate interaction
T 0 that appears in this test, V (T 0 ) = P. In other words, the
only possible explanation for the failure is the failure of T .
C. Matrix Representation
Suppose that each individual component passed the testing.
Then the operation table starts from 2-way interactions, then
enlarges to t-way interactions step by step. During the procedure, many test results can be deduced from the existing results
following TA rules. For example, all possible configurations
of (a, b, c, d, e, f ) can be expressed in the form of matrix, or
operation table. First, we show the operation table for 2-way
interactions. The entries in the operation table are symmetric
and those on the main diagonal are not necessary. So only half
of the entries are shown.
As shown in Figure 1, 3-way interactions can be composed
by using 2-way interactions and components. Thus, following
the TA implication rules, the 3-way interactions operation table
is composed based on the results of 2-way combinations. Here,
(a, b, c, d, e, f ) has more 3-way interactions than 2-way
interactions. As seen in Figure 1, a 3-way interaction can be
obtained through different combinations of 2-way interactions

and components. For example, {a, b, c} = {a} ∪ {b, c} =
{b}∪{a, c} = {c}∪{a, b} = {a, b}∪{a, c} = {a, b}∪{b, c} =
{a, c} ∪ {b, c}. V (a) ⊗ V (b, c) = V (c) ⊗ V (a, b) = V (a, b) ⊗
V (b, c) = P⊗P = U. But V (b)⊗V (a, c) = V (a, b)⊗V (a, c) =
V (b, c) ⊗ V (a, c) = P ⊗ F = F. As TA defines the order of
the five status indicators, the result should be the value with
highest order. So V (a, b, c) = F.

D. Merging Concurrent Testing Results
One way to achieve efficient testing is to allocate (overlapping or non-overlapping) tenant applications into different
clusters, and each cluster is sent to a different set of servers
for execution. Once each cluster completes its execution, the
test results can be merged. The testing results of a specific
interaction T in different servers should satisfy the following
constraints.
• If V (T ) = U in one cluster, then in other clusters, the
same V (T ) can be either F, P, N, or U.
• If V (T ) = N in one cluster, then in other clusters, the
same V (T ) can be either F, P, N, or U.
• If V (T ) = P in one cluster, then the same V (T ) can be
either P, N, or U in all clusters;
• If V (T ) = F in one cluster, then in other clusters, the
same V (T ) can be F, N, or U.
• If V (T ) = X in one cluster, then in other clusters, the
same V (T ) can be X only.
If these constraints are satisfied, then the testing results can
be merged. Otherwise, there must be an error in the testing
results. To represent this situation, a new status indicator, error
(E), is introduced and E  X. We define a binary operation ⊕
on {E, X, F, P, N, U}, with operation table as follows:
⊕
E
X
F
P
N
U

⊕ also has the properties of commutativity and associativity.
See Appendix for proof of associativity.
Using this operation, merging two testing results from two
different servers can be defined as Vmerged (T ) = Vcluster1 (T ) ⊕
Vcluster2 (T ). The merge can be performed in any order due to
the commutativity and associativity of ⊕, and if the constraints
of merge are satisfied and V (T ) = X, F, or P, the results cannot
be changed by any further testing or merging of test results
unless there are some errors in testing. If V (T ) = E, the testing

environment must be corrected and tests executed again after
fixing the error(s) in testing. For example, Vcluster1 (a, c, e) = X
and Vcluster2 (a, c, e) = F, so Vmerged (a, c, e) = X ⊕ F = E.
It means that there is something wrong with the tests of
interaction (a, c, e), and the problem must be fixed before
doing further testing.
Following the ⊕ associative rule, one can derive the following.
V1 (T ) ⊕ V2 (T ) ⊕ V3 (T )
= (V1 (T ) ⊕ V2 (T )) ⊕ V3 (T )
= V1 (T ) ⊕ (V2 (T ) ⊕ V3 (T ))
= V1 (T ) ⊕ V2 (T ) ⊕ V3 (T ) ⊕ V3 (T )
= (V1 (T ) ⊕ V2 (T )) ⊕ (V2 (T ) ⊕ V3 (T ))
= ((V1 (T ) ⊕ V2 (T )) ⊕ V2 (T )) ⊕ V3 (T )
= (V3 (T ) ⊕ V2 (T )) ⊕ (V3 (T ) ⊕ V1 (T ))
Thus the ⊕ rule allows one to partition the configurations
into different sets for different servers to run testing, and
these sets do not need to be non-overlapping. In conventional
cloud computing operations such as MapReduce, data should
not overlap, otherwise incorrect data may be produced. For
example, counting the items in a set can be performed by
MapReduce, but data allocated to different servers cannot
overlap, otherwise items may be counted more than once. In
TA, this is not a concern due to the nature of the TA operations

⊕. Once the results are available from each server, the testing
results can be merged either incrementally, in parallel, or in
any order. Furthermore, test results can be merged repeatedly
without changing the final results.
Using this approach, one can test say 10 batches of 100 tenant applications each, for a total of 1, 000 tenant applications.
Once this is done, another batch of 1, 000 tenant applications
can be tested with each 100 tenant application allocated to a
server for execution. In this way, after running 100 batches,
100, 000 tenant applications can be evaluated completely.
The following example illustrates the testing process of
fifteen configurations. According to the definition of configuration testing, all feasible interactions should be tested. For
simplicity, assume that only interaction (c, d, f ) is faulty, and
only interaction (c, d, e) is infeasible, and all other interactions
pass the testing. If one assigns configurations 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11,
13, 15 into Server1 , configurations 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14 into
Server2 , and 4-11 configurations into Server3 .
If Server1 and Server3 do their own testing first, Server2
can reuse test results of interactions from them to eliminate
interactions that need to be tested. For example, when testing
2-way interactions of configuration (b, c, d, f ) in Server2 ,
it can reuse the test results of (b, c), (b, d) of configuration
(b, c, d, e) from Server3 , (b, f ) of configuration (a, b, c, f )

from Server1 . They are all passed, and it can reuse the test
results of (b, c, d) of configuration (a, b, c, d) from Server1 ,
(b, c, f ) of configuration (a, b, c, f ) from Server1 , (b, d, f )
of configuration (a, b, d, f ) from Server1 , and (c, d, f ) of
configuration (a, c, d, f ) from Server3 . Because (c, d, f ) is
faulty, it can deduce that 4-way interaction (b, c, d, f ) is also
faulty. For the sets of configuration that are overlapping, their
returned test results from different servers are the same. The
merged results of these results also stay the same.
Not only interactions, sets of configurations, CS1 , CS2 ,
. . . , CSK can be allocated to different processors (or clusters)
for testing, and the test results can then be merged. The sets
can be non-overlapping or overlapping, and the merge process
can be arbitrary. For example, say the result of CSi is RCSi ,
the merge process can be (· · · ((((RCS1 + RCS2 ) + RCS3 ) +
RCS4 ) + · · · + RCSK ), or (· · · ((((RCSK + RCSk−1 ) +
RCSk−2 ) + · · · + RCS1 ), or any other sequence that includes
all RCSi , for i = 1 to K. This is true because RCS is simply
a set of V (Tj ) for any intercation Tj in the configuration CSi .

IV. C ONCLUSION
This paper proposes TA to address SaaS combinatorial
testing. The TA provides a foundation for concurrent combinatorial testing. The TA has two operations and test results
can have five states with a priority. By using the TA operations, many combinatorial tests can be eliminated as the
TA identifies those interactions that need not be tested. Also
the TA defines operation rules to merge test results done by
different processors, so that combinatorial tests can be done in
a concurrent manner. The TA rules ensure that either merged
results are consistent or a testing error has been detected so
that retest is needed. In this way, large-scale combinatorial
testing can be carried out in a cloud platform with a large
number of processors to perform test execution in parallel to
identify faulty interactions.

Perform 2-way interaction testing first. Before going on to 3way interaction testing, use the results of 2-way testing to eliminate cases. The testing process stops when finishing testing all
t-way interactions. The analysis of t-way interactions is based
on the P T Rs of all (t − i)-way interactions for 1 ≤ i < t.
The superset of infeasible, irrelevant, and faulty test cases do
not need to be tested. The test results of the superset can be
obtained by TA operations and must be infeasible, irrelevant,
or faulty. But the superset of test cases with unknown indicator
must be tested. In this way, a large repeating testing workload
can be reduced.
For n components, all t-way interactions for t ≥ 2
are composed by 2-way, 3-way, ..., t-way interactions. In
n components combinatorial

A PPENDIX
The associativity of binary operation ⊗.
V (T1 ) ⊗ (V (T2 ) ⊗ V (T3 )) = (V (T1 ) ⊗ V (T2 )) ⊗ V (T3 ).
Proof: We will prove this property in the following cases.
(1) At least one of V (T1 ), V (T2 ), and V (T3 ) is X. Without
loss of generality, suppose that V (T1 ) = X, then according
to the operation table of ⊗, V (T1 ) ⊗ (V (T2 ) ⊗ V (T3 )) =
X ⊗ (V (T2 ) ⊗ V (T3 )) = X, (V (T1 ) ⊗ V (T2 )) ⊗ V (T3 ) =
(X ⊗ V (T2 )) ⊗ V (T3 ) = X ⊗ V (T3 ) = X. Thus, in this case,
V (T1 ) ⊗ (V (T2 ) ⊗ V (T3 )) = (V (T1 ) ⊗ V (T2 )) ⊗ V (T3 ).
(2) V (T1 ), V (T2 ), and V (T3 ) are not X and at least one
of V (T1 ), V (T2 ), and V (T3 ) is F. Without loss of generality,
suppose that V (T1 ) = F, then according to the operation table
of ⊗, the value of V (T2 ) ⊗ V (T3 ) can only be F, N or U.
So V (T1 ) ⊗ (V (T2 ) ⊗ V (T3 )) = F ⊗ (V (T2 ) ⊗ V (T3 )) = F,
(V (T1 ) ⊗ V (T2 )) ⊗ V (T3 ) = (F ⊗ V (T2 )) ⊗ V (T3 ) = F ⊗
V (T3 ) = F. Thus, in this case, V (T1 ) ⊗ (V (T2 ) ⊗ V (T3 )) =
(V (T1 ) ⊗ V (T2 )) ⊗ V (T3 ).
(3) V (T1 ), V (T2 ), and V (T3 ) are not X or F and at least one
of V (T1 ), V (T2 ), and V (T3 ) is N. Without loss of generality,
suppose that V (T1 ) = N, then according to the operation table
of ⊗, the value of V (T2 ) ⊗ V (T3 ) can only be N or U. So
V (T1 ) ⊗ (V (T2 ) ⊗ V (T3 )) = N ⊗ (V (T2 ) ⊗ V (T3 )) = N,
(V (T1 ) ⊗ V (T2 )) ⊗ V (T3 ) = (N ⊗ V (T2 )) ⊗ V (T3 ) = N ⊗
V (T3 ) = N. Thus, in this case, V (T1 ) ⊗ (V (T2 ) ⊗ V (T3 )) =
(V (T1 ) ⊗ V (T2 )) ⊗ V (T3 ).
(4) V (T1 ), V (T2 ), and V (T3 ) are not X, F or N. In this case,
V (T1 ), V (T2 ), and V (T3 ) can only be P or U. According to the
operation table of ⊗, the value of V (T1 )⊗V (T2 ) and V (T2 )⊗
V (T3 ) are U. So V (T1 ) ⊗ (V (T2 ) ⊗ V (T3 )) = V (T1 ) ⊗ U = U,
(V (T1 ) ⊗ V (T2 )) ⊗ V (T3 ) = U ⊗ V (T3 ) = U. Thus, in this
case, V (T1 ) ⊗ (V (T2 ) ⊗ V (T3 )) = (V (T1 ) ⊗ V (T2 )) ⊗ V (T3 ).
The associativity of binary operation ⊕.
V1 (T ) ⊕ (V2 (T ) ⊕ V3 (T )) = (V1 (T ) ⊕ V2 (T )) ⊕ V3 (T ).
Proof: We will prove this property in the following cases.
(1) One of V1 (T ), V2 (T ), and V3 (T ) is E. Without loss
of generality, suppose that V1 (T ) = E, then according to the
operation table of ⊕, V1 (T )⊕(V2 (T )⊕V3 (T )) = E⊗(V2 (T )⊕
V3 (T )) = E, (V1 (T ) ⊕ V2 (T )) ⊕ V3 (T ) = (E ⊕ V2 (T )) ⊕
V3 (T ) = E⊕V3 (T ) = E. Thus, in this case, V1 (T )⊕(V2 (T )⊕
V3 (T )) = (V1 (T ) ⊕ V2 (T )) ⊕ V3 (T ).

(2) V1 (T ), V2 (T ), and V3 (T ) are not E, and there is a pair
of V1 (T ), V2 (T ), and V3 (T ) does not satisfy the constrains.
Without loss of generality, suppose that V1 (T ) and V2 (T ) does
not satisfy the constrains, then according to the operation table
of ⊕, V1 (T ) ⊕ V2 (T ) = E. So (V1 (T ) ⊕ V2 (T )) ⊕ V3 (T ) =
E ⊕ V3 (T ) = E. Since V1 (T ) and V2 (T ) does not satisfy the
constrains, there can be two cases: (a) one of them is X and
the other is not, or (b) one of them is P and the other is F.
(a) If V1 (T ) = X, then V2 (T ) ⊕ V3 (T ) cannot be X because
V2 (T ) cannot be X. Thus, V1 (T ) ⊕ (V2 (T ) ⊕ V3 (T )) = E. If
V2 (T ) = X, then V2 (T ) ⊕ V3 (T ) 6= X can only be E or X.
Since V1 (T ) cannot be X, V1 (T ) ⊕ (V2 (T ) ⊕ V3 (T )) = E.
(b) If V1 (T ) = P and V2 (T ) = F, then V2 (T ) ⊕ V3 (T )
can only be E or F. Thus, V1 (T ) ⊕ (V2 (T ) ⊕ V3 (T )) = E. If
V1 (T ) = F and V2 (T ) = P, then V2 (T ) ⊕ V3 (T ) can only be
E or P. Thus, V1 (T ) ⊕ (V2 (T ) ⊕ V3 (T )) = E.
Thus, in this case, V1 (T ) ⊕ (V2 (T ) ⊕ V3 (T )) = (V1 (T ) ⊕
V2 (T )) ⊕ V3 (T ).
(3) V1 (T ), V2 (T ), and V3 (T ) are not E, and V1 (T ), V2 (T ),
and V3 (T ) satisfy the constrains.
(a) One of V1 (T ), V2 (T ), and V3 (T ) is X. Without loss of
generality, suppose that V1 (T ) = X, then V2 (T ) = V3 (T ) = X.
So V1 (T ) ⊕ (V2 (T ) ⊕ V3 (T )) = X ⊕ (X ⊕ X) = X ⊕ X = X and
(V1 (T ) ⊕ V2 (T )) ⊕ V3 (T ) = (X ⊕ X) ⊕ X = X ⊕ X = X.
(b) V1 (T ), V2 (T ), and V3 (T ) are not X, and one of V1 (T ),
V2 (T ), and V3 (T ) is F. Without loss of generality, suppose
that V1 (T ) = F, then V2 (T ) and V3 (T ) can only be F, N,
or U. According to operation table of ⊕, V2 (T ) ⊕ V3 (T ) can
only be F, N, or U, and V1 (T ) ⊕ V2 (T ) can only be F. So
V1 (T ) ⊕ (V2 (T ) ⊕ V3 (T )) = F ⊕ (V2 (T ) ⊕ V3 (T )) = F and
(V1 (T ) ⊕ V2 (T )) ⊕ V3 (T ) = F ⊕ V3 (T ) = F.
(c) V1 (T ), V2 (T ), and V3 (T ) are not X or F, and one of
V1 (T ), V2 (T ), and V3 (T ) is P. Without loss of generality,
suppose that V1 (T ) = P, then V2 (T ) and V3 (T ) can only be
P, N, or U. According to operation table of ⊕, V2 (T ) ⊕ V3 (T )
can only be P, N, or U, and V1 (T ) ⊕ V2 (T ) can only be F. So
V1 (T ) ⊕ (V2 (T ) ⊕ V3 (T )) = P ⊕ (V2 (T ) ⊕ V3 (T )) = P and
(V1 (T ) ⊕ V2 (T )) ⊕ V3 (T ) = P ⊕ V3 (T ) = P.
(d) V1 (T ), V2 (T ), and V3 (T ) are not X, F or P, and one
of V1 (T ), V2 (T ), and V3 (T ) is U. Without loss of generality,
suppose that V1 (T ) = U, then V2 (T ) and V3 (T ) can only be
N, or U. According to operation table of ⊕, V2 (T ) ⊕ V3 (T )
can only be N, or U, and V1 (T ) ⊕ V2 (T ) can only be U. So
V1 (T ) ⊕ (V2 (T ) ⊕ V3 (T )) = U ⊕ (V2 (T ) ⊕ V3 (T )) = U and
(V1 (T ) ⊕ V2 (T )) ⊕ V3 (T ) = U ⊕ V3 (T ) = U.
(e) V1 (T ), V2 (T ), and V3 (T ) are N. V1 (T ) ⊕ (V2 (T ) ⊕
V3 (T )) = N ⊕ (N ⊕ N) = N ⊕ N = N and (V1 (T ) ⊕ V2 (T )) ⊕
V3 (T ) = (N ⊕ N) ⊕ N = N ⊕ N = N.
Thus, in this case, V1 (T ) ⊕ (V2 (T ) ⊕ V3 (T )) = (V1 (T ) ⊕
V2 (T )) ⊕ V3 (T ).

EXISTENCE AND ASYMPTOTIC BEHAVIOR OF SOLUTIONS
TO THE GENERALIZED DAMPED BOUSSINESQ EQUATION
YINXIA WANG

Abstract. We consider the Cauchy problem for the n-dimensional generalized damped Boussinesq equation. Based on decay estimates of solutions
to the corresponding linear equation, we define a solution space with time
weighted norms. Under small condition on the initial value, the existence and
asymptotic behavior of global solutions in the corresponding Sobolev spaces
are established by the contraction mapping principle.

1. Introduction
We study the Cauchy problem of the generalized damped Boussinesq equation
in n space dimensions
utt − a∆utt − 2b∆ut − α∆3 u + β∆2 u − ∆u = ∆f (u)

(1.1)

with the initial value
t=0:

u = u0 (x),

ut = u1 (x).

(1.2)

Here u = u(x, t) is the unknown function of x = (x1 , · · · , xn ) ∈ Rn and t > 0,
a, b, α, β are positive constants. The nonlinear term f (u) = O(u1+θ ) and θ is a
positive integer.
The first initial boundary value problem for
utt − a∆utt − 2b∆ut − α∆3 u + β∆2 u − ∆u = γ∆(u2 )

(1.3)

in a unit circle was investigated in [16], where a, b, α, β are positive constants and γ
is a constant. The existence and the uniqueness of strong solution was established
and the solutions were constructed in the form of series in the small parameter
present in the initial conditions. The long-time asymptotics was also obtained in
the explicit form. In [1], the authors considered the initial-boundary value problem
for (1.3) in the unit ball B ⊂ R3 , similar results were established. It is well-known
that the equation (1.3) is closely contacted with many wave equations. For example,
the equation (which we call the Bq equation)
utt − uxx + uxxxx = (u2 )xx ,

which was derived by Boussinesq in 1872 to describe shallow water waves. The
improved Bq equation(which we call IBq equation) is
utt − uxx − uxxtt = (u2 )xx .
A modification of the IBq equation analogous of the MKdV equation yields
utt − uxx − uxxtt = (u3 )xx ,
which we call the IMBq equation (see [5]). (1.1) is a higher order wave equation. In
[8], we considered the Cauchy problem for the Cahn-Hilliard equation with inertial
term. Combining high frequency, low frequency technique and energy methods,
we obtained global existence and asymptotic behavior of solutions. Wang, Liu
and Zhang [13] investigated a fourth wave equation that is of the regularity-loss
type. Based on the decay property of the solution operators, global existence and
asymptotic behavior of solutions are obtained. For global existence and asymptotic
behavior of solutions to higher order wave equations, we refer to [2]-[3] and [6]-[15]
and references therein.
The main purpose of this paper is to establish global existence and asymptotic
behavior of solutions to (1.1), (1.2) by using the contraction mapping principle.
Firstly, we consider the decay property of the following linear equation
utt − a∆utt − 2b∆ut − α∆3 u + β∆2 u − ∆u = 0.

We obtain the following decay estimate of solutions to (1.4) associated with initial

(h ≤ s) Based on the estimates (1.5) and (1.6), we define a solution space with
time weighted norms. Then global existence and asymptotic behavior of classical
solutions to (1.1), (1.2) are obtained by using the contraction mapping principle.
We give notation which is used in this paper. Let F [u] denote the Fourier
transform of u defined by
Z
û(ξ) = F [u] =
e−iξ·x u(x)dx,
Rn

and we denote its inverse transform by F −1 .
For 1 ≤ p ≤ ∞, Lp = Lp (Rn ) denotes the usual Lebesgue space with the
norm k · kLp . The usual Sobolev space of s is defined by Hps = (I − ∆)−s/2 Lp
with the norm kf kHps = k(I − ∆)s/2 f kLp ; the homogeneous Sobolev space of s is
defined by Ḣps = (−∆)−s/2 Lp with the norm kf kHps = k(−∆)s/2 f kLp ; especially
H s = H2s , Ḣ s = Ḣ2s . Moreover, we know that Hps = Lp ∩ Ḣps for s ≥ 0.
Finally, in this paper, we denote every positive constant by the same symbol C
or c without confusion. [·] is the Gauss symbol.
The article is organized as follows. In Section 2 we derive the solution formula
of our semi-linear problem. We study the decay property of the solution operators
appearing in the solution formula in section 3. Then, in Section 4, we discuss the
linear problem and show the decay estimates. Finally, we prove global existence

and asymptotic behavior of solutions for the Cauchy problem (1.1), (1.2) in Section

2. Solution formula
The aim of this section is to derive the solution formula for problem (1.1), (1.2).
We first investigate the equation (1.4). Taking the Fourier transform, we have
(1 + a|ξ|2 )ûtt + 2b|ξ|2 ût + (α|ξ|6 + β|ξ|4 + |ξ|2 )û = 0.

(2.1)

The corresponding initial value are
t=0:

û = û0 (ξ),

ût = û1 (ξ).

(2.2)

The characteristic equation of (2.1) is
(1 + a|ξ|2 )λ2 + 2b|ξ|2 λ + α|ξ|6 + β|ξ|4 + |ξ|2 = 0.
Let λ = λ± (ξ) be the corresponding eigenvalues of (2.3), we obtain
p
−b|ξ|2 ± |ξ| −1 − (a + β − b2 )|ξ|2 − (α + aβ)|ξ|4 − aα|ξ|6
λ± (ξ) =
.
1 + a|ξ|2

(2.3)

(2.4)

The solution to the problem (2.1)-(2.2) is given in the form
û(ξ, t) = Ĝ(ξ, t)û1 (ξ) + Ĥ(ξ, t)û0 (ξ),

(2.5)

where
Ĝ(ξ, t) =

1
(eλ+ (ξ)t − eλ− (ξ)t )
λ+ (ξ) − λ− (ξ)

(2.6)

and
1
(λ+ (ξ)eλ− (ξ)t − λ− (ξ)eλ+ (ξ)t ).
λ+ (ξ) − λ− (ξ)
We define G(x, t) and H(x, t) by
Ĥ(ξ, t) =

G(x, t) = F −1 [Ĝ(ξ, t)](x),

(2.7)

H(x, t) = F −1 [Ĥ(ξ, t)](x),

respectively, where F −1 denotes the inverse Fourier transform. Then, applying
F −1 to (2.5), we obtain
u(t) = G(t) ∗ u1 + H(t) ∗ u0 .
By the Duhamel principle, we obtain the solution formula to (1.1), (1.2),
Z t
u(t) = G(t) ∗ u1 + H(t) ∗ u0 +
G(t − τ ) ∗ (I − a∆)−1 ∆f (u)(τ )dτ.

3. Decay Property
The aim of this section is to establish decay estimates of the solution operators
G(t) and H(t) appearing in the solution formula (2.8).
Lemma 3.1. The solution of problem (2.1), (2.2) satisfies
|ξ|2 (1+|ξ|2 )|û(ξ, t)|2 +|ût (ξ, t)|2 ≤ Ce−cω(ξ)t (|ξ|2 (1+|ξ|2 )|û0 (ξ)|2 +|û1 (ξ)|2 ), (3.1)

Proof. Multiplying (2.1) by û

(3.3)
Multiplying both sides of (3.2) and (3.3) by (1 + a|ξ|2 ) and b|ξ|2 respectively, summing up the products yields

where

and
F = b|ξ|2 (α|ξ|6 + β|ξ|4 + |ξ|2 )|û|2 + b|ξ|2 (1 + a|ξ|2 )|ût |2 .
A simple computation implies that
C(1 + |ξ|2 )2 E0 ≤ E ≤ C(1 + |ξ|2 )2 E0 ,

(3.5)

where
E0 = |ξ|2 (1 + |ξ|2 )|û|2 + |ût |2 .
Note that F ≥ c|ξ|2 E0 . It follows from (3.5) that
F ≥ cω(ξ)E,

(3.6)

where
ω(ξ) =

|ξ|2

Using (3.4) and (3.6), we obtain

Thus E(ξ, t) ≤ e−cw(ξ)t E(ξ, 0), which together with (3.5) proves the desired estimates (3.1). Then the proof is complete.

Lemma 3.2. Let Ĝ(ξ, t) and Ĥ(ξ, t) be the fundamental solution of (1.4) in the
Fourier space, which are given in (2.6) and (2.7), respectively. Then we have the
estimates
|ξ|2 (1 + |ξ|2 )|Ĝ(ξ, t)|2 + |Ĝt (ξ, t)|2 ≤ Ce−cω(ξ)t

(3.7)

|ξ|2 (1 + |ξ|2 )|Ĥ(ξ, t)|2 + |Ĥt (ξ, t)|2 ≤ C|ξ|2 (1 + |ξ|2 )e−cω(ξ)t

Proof. If û0 (ξ) = 0, from (2.5), we obtain
û(ξ, t) = Ĝ(ξ, t)û1 (ξ),

ût (ξ, t) = Ĝt (ξ, t)û1 (ξ).

Substituting the equalities into (3.1) with û0 (ξ) = 0, we obtain (3.7). In what
follows, we consider û1 (ξ) = 0, it follows from (2.5) that
û(ξ, t) = Ĥ(ξ, t)û0 (ξ), ût (ξ, t) = Ĥt (ξ, t)û0 (ξ).
Substituting the equalities into (3.1) with û1 (ξ) = 0, we obtain the desired estimate
(3.8). The Lemma is proved.

follows, we prove (4.3). Using (4.1) and Gagliardo-Nirenberg inequality, it is not
difficult to get (4.3). The Lemma is proved.

5. Existence of global solution and asymptotic behavior
The purpose of this section is to prove the existence and asymptotic behavior of
global solutions to the Cauchy problem (1.1), (1.2). We need the following Lemma,
which come from [4] (see also [17]).

Based on the estimates (4.1)-(4.3) of solutions to (1.4) associated with initial

Two-stage algorithms for covering array construction

Abstract
Modern software systems often consist of many different components, each with a number of options.
Although unit tests may reveal faulty options for individual components, functionally correct components
may interact in unforeseen ways to cause a fault. Covering arrays are used to test for interactions
among components systematically. A two-stage framework, providing a number of concrete algorithms,
is developed for the efficient construction of covering arrays. In the first stage, a time and memory
efficient randomized algorithm covers most of the interactions. In the second stage, a more sophisticated
search covers the remainder in relatively few tests. In this way, the storage limitations of the sophisticated
search algorithms are avoided; hence the range of the number of components for which the algorithm can
be applied is extended, without increasing the number of tests. Many of the framework instantiations
can be tuned to optimize a memory-quality trade-off, so that fewer tests can be achieved using more
memory. The algorithms developed outperform the currently best known methods when the number
of components ranges from 20 to 60, the number of options for each ranges from 3 to 6, and t-way
interactions are covered for t ∈ {5, 6}. In some cases a reduction in the number of tests by more than
50% is achieved.

Introduction

Real world software and engineered systems are composed of many different components, each with a number
of options, that are required to work together in a variety of circumstances. Components are factors, and
options for a component form the levels of its factor. Although each level for an individual factor can be tested
in isolation, faults in deployed software can arise from interactions among levels of different factors. When
an interaction involves levels of t different factors, it is a t-way interaction. Testing for faults caused by t-way
interactions for every t is generally infeasible, as a result of a combinatorial explosion. However, empirical
research on real world software systems indicates that testing all possible 2-way (or 3-way) interactions
would detect 70% (or 90%) of all faults [25]. Moreover, testing all possible 6-way interactions is sufficient
for detection of 100% of all faults in the systems examined in [25]. Testing all possible t-way interactions for
some 2 ≤ t ≤ 6 is pseudo-exhaustive testing [24], and is accomplished with a combinatorial array known as
a covering array.
Formally, let N, t, k, and v be integers with k ≥ t ≥ 2 and v ≥ 2. A covering array CA(N ; t, k, v) is an
N × k array A in which each entry is from a v-ary alphabet Σ, and for every N × t sub-array B of A and
every x ∈ Σt , there is a row of B that equals x. Then t is the strength of the covering array, k is the number
of factors, and v is the number of levels.
When k is a positive integer, [k] denotes the set {1, . . . , k}. A t-way interaction is {(ci , ai ) : 1 ≤ i ≤
t, ci ∈ [k], ci 6= cj for i 6= j, and ai ∈ Σ}. So an interaction is an assignment of levels from Σ to t of the k

factors. It,k,v denotes the set of all kt v t interactions for given t, k and v. An N × k array A covers the
1

interaction ι = {(ci , ai ) : 1 ≤ i ≤ t, ci ∈ [k], ci 6= cj for i 6= j, and ai ∈ Σ} if there is a row r in A such that
A(r, ci ) = ai for 1 ≤ i ≤ t. When there is no such row in A, ι is not covered in A. Hence a CA(N ; t, k, v)
covers all interactions in It,k,v .
Covering arrays are used extensively for interaction testing in complex engineered systems. To ensure
that all possible combinations of options of t components function together correctly, one needs examine
all possible t-way interactions. When the number of components is k, and the number of different options
available for each component is v, each row of CA(N ; t, k, v) represents a test case. The N test cases
collectively test all t-way interactions. For this reason, covering arrays have been used in combinatorial
interaction testing in varied fields like software and hardware engineering, design of composite materials,
and biological networks [8, 24, 26, 32, 34].
The cost of testing is directly related to the number of test cases. Therefore, one is interested in covering
arrays with the fewest rows. The smallest value of N for which CA(N ; t, k, v) exists is denoted by CAN(t, k, v).
Efforts to determine or bound CAN(t, k, v) have been extensive; see [12, 14, 24, 31] for example. Naturally one
would prefer to determine CAN(t, k, v) exactly. Katona [22] and Kleitman and Spencer [23] independently
showed that
 for t = v = 2, the minimum number of rows N in a CA(N ; 2, k, 2) is the smallest N for which

k≤ N

d2e
some progress has been made in determining upper bounds for CAN(t, k, v) in the general case; for recent
results, see [33].
For practical applications such bounds are often unhelpful, because one needs explicit covering arrays to
use as test suites. Explicit constructions can be recursive, producing larger covering arrays using smaller ones
as ingredients (see [14] for a survey), or direct. Direct methods for some specific cases arise from algebraic,
geometric, or number-theoretic techniques; general direct methods are computational in nature. Indeed
when k is relatively small, the best known results arise from computational techniques [13], and these are
in turn essential for the successes of recursive methods. Unfortunately, the existing computational methods
encounter difficulties as k increases, but is still within the range needed for practical applications. Typically
such difficulties arise either as a result of storage or time limitations or by producing covering arrays that
are too big to compete with those arising from simpler recursive methods.
Cohen [11] discusses commercial software where the number of factors often exceeds 50. Aldaco et al. [1]
analyze a complex engineered system having 75 factors, using a variant of covering arrays. Android [3] uses
a Configuration class to describe the device configuration; there are 17 different configuration parameters
with 3 − 20 different levels. In each of these cases, while existing techniques are effective when the strength
is small, these moderately large values of k pose concerns for larger strengths.
In this paper, we focus on situations in which every factor has the same number of levels. These cases
have been most extensively studied, and hence provide a basis for making comparisons. In practice, however,
often different components have different number of levels, which is captured by extending the notion of a
covering array. A mixed covering array MCA(N ; t, k, (v1 , v2 , . . . , vk )) is an N × k array in which the ith
column contains vi symbols for 1 ≤ i ≤ k. When {i1 , . . . , it } ⊆ {1, . . . , k} is
Qat set of t columns, in the N × t
subarray obtained by selecting columns i1 , . . . , it of the MCA, each of the j=1 vij distinct t-tuples appears
as a row at least once. Although we examine the uniform case in which v1 = · · · = vk , the methods developed
here can all be directly applied to mixed covering arrays as well.
Inevitably, when k > max(t + 1, v + 2), a covering array must cover some interactions more than once,
for if not they are orthogonal arrays [20]. Treating the rows of a covering array in a fixed order, each row
covers some number of interactions not covered by any earlier row. For a variety of known constructions,
the initial rows cover many new interactions, while the later ones cover very few [7]. Comparing this rate
of coverage for a purely random method and for one of the sophisticated search techniques, one finds little
difference in the initial rows, but very substantial differences in the final ones. This suggests strategies to
build the covering array in stages, investing more effort as the number of remaining uncovered interactions
declines.
In this paper we propose a new algorithmic framework for covering array construction, the two-stage
framework. In the first stage, a randomized row construction method builds a specified number of rows to
cover all but at most a specified, small number of interactions. As we see later, by dint of being randomized

2

this uses very little memory. The second stage is a more sophisticated search that adds few rows to cover the
remaining uncovered interactions. We choose search algorithms whose requirements depend on the number
of interactions to be covered, to profit from the fact that few interactions remain. By mixing randomized and
deterministic methods, we hope to retain the fast execution and small storage of the randomized methods,
along with the accuracy of the deterministic search techniques.
We introduce a number of algorithms within the two-stage framework. Some improve upon best known
bounds on CAN(t, k, v) (see [33]) in principle. But our focus is on the practical consequences: The twostage algorithms are indeed quite efficient for higher strength (t ∈ {5, 6}) and moderate number of levels
(v ∈ {3, 4, 5, 6}), when the number of factors k is moderately high (approximately in the range of 20 − 80
depending on value of t and v). In fact, for many combination of t, k and v values the two-stage algorithms
beat the previously best known bounds.
Torres-Jimenez et al. [36] explore a related two-stage strategy. In their first stage, an in-parameter-order
greedy strategy (as used in ACTS [24]) adds a column to an existing array; in their second stage, simulated
annealing is applied to cover the remaining interactions. They apply their methods when t = v = 3, when
the storage and time requirements for both stages remain acceptable. In addition to the issues in handling
larger strengths, their methods provide no a priori bound on the size of the resulting array. In contrast with
their methods, ours provide a guarantee prior to execution with much more modest storage and time.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 reviews algorithmic methods of covering array
construction, specifically the randomized algorithm and the density algorithm. This section contrasts these
two methods and points out their limitations. Then it gives an intuitive answer to the question of why a two
stage based strategy might work and introduces the general two-stage framework. Section 3 introduces some
specific two-stage algorithms. Section 3.1 analyzes and evaluates the naı̈ve strategy. Section 3.2 describes a
two-stage algorithm that combines the randomized and the density algorithm. Section 3.3 introduces graph
coloring based techniques in the second stage. Section 3.4 examines the effect of group action on the size
of the constructed covering arrays. Section 4 compares the results of various two-stage algorithms with the
presently best known sizes. In Section 5 we discuss the Lovász local lemma (LLL) bounds on CAN(t, k, v)
and provide a Moser-Tardos type randomized algorithm for covering array construction that matches the
bound. Although the bound was known [18], the proof was non-constructive, and a constructive algorithm to
match this bound seems to be absent in the literature. We explore potentially better randomized algorithms
for the first stage using LLL based techniques, We also obtain a two-stage bound that improves the LLL
bound for CAN(t, k, v). We conclude the paper in Section 6.

Algorithmic construction of covering arrays

Available algorithms for the construction of covering arrays are primarily heuristic in nature; indeed exact
algorithms have succeeded for very few cases. Computationally intensive metaheuristic search methods such
as simulated annealing, tabu search, constraint programming, and genetic algorithms have been employed
when the strength is relatively small or the number of factors and levels is small. These methods have
established many of the best known bounds on sizes of covering arrays [13], but for many problems of
practical size their time and storage requirements are prohibitive. For larger problems, the best available
methods are greedy. The IPO family of algorithms [24] repeatedly adds one column at a time, and
 then adds
new rows to ensure complete coverage. In this way, at any point in time, the status of v t k−1
t−1 interactions
may be stored. AETG [10] pioneered a different method, which greedily selects one row at a time to cover
a large number of as-yet-uncovered interactions. They establish that if a row can be chosen that covers the
maximum number, a good a priori bound on the size of the covering array can be computed. Unfortunately
selecting the maximum is NP-hard, and even if one selects the maximum there is no guarantee that the
covering array is the smallest possible
 [7], so AETG resorts to a good heuristic selection of the next row by
examining the stored status of v t kt interactions. None of the methods so far mentioned therefore guarantee
to reach an a priori bound. An
 extension of the AETG strategy, the density algorithm [5, 6, 15], stores
additional statistics for all v t kt interactions in order to ensure the selection of a good next row, and hence
guarantees to produce an array with at most the precomputed number of rows. Variants of the density

algorithm have proved to be most effective for problems of moderately large size. For even larger problems,
pure random approaches have been applied.
To produce methods that provide a guarantee on size, it is natural to focus on the density algorithm
in order to understand its strengths and weaknesses. To do this, we contrast it with a basic randomized
algorithm. Algorithm 1 shows a simple randomized algorithm for covering array construction. The algorithm
constructs an array of a particular size randomly and checks whether all the interactions are covered. It
repeats until it finds an array that covers all the interactions.

In fact, the probability that the N × k array constructed in line 3 of Algorithm 1 is a valid covering array
is high enough that the expected number of times the loop in line 2 is repeated is a small constant.
An alternative strategy is to add rows one by one instead of constructing the full array at the outset. We
start with an empty array, and whenever we add a new row we ensure that it covers at least the expected
number of previously uncovered interactions for a randomly chosen row. The probability that an uncovered
interaction is covered by a random row is 1/v t . If the number of uncovered interactions is u, then by linearity
of expectation, the expected number of newly covered interactions in a randomly chosen row is uv −t . If each
row added covers exactly this expected number, we obtain the same number of rows as the SLJ bound,
realized in Algorithm 1. But because the actual number of newly covered interactions is always an integer,
each added row covers at least duv −t e interactions. This is especially helpful towards the end when the
expected number is a small fraction.
Algorithm 2 follows this strategy. Again the probability that a randomly chosen row covers at least the
expected number of previously uncovered interactions is high enough that the expected number of times the
row selection loop in line 6 of Algorithm 2 is repeated is bounded by a small constant.
We can obtain an upper bound on the size produced by Algorithm 2 by assuming that each new row
added covers exactly duv −t e previously uncovered interactions. This bound is the discrete Stein-Lovász4

Johnson (discrete SLJ) bound. Figure 1 compares the sizes of covering arrays obtained from the SLJ and
the discrete SLJ bounds for different values of k when t = 6 and v = 3. Consider a concrete example, when
t = 5, k = 20, and v = 3. The SLJ bound guarantees the existence of a covering array with 12499 rows,
whereas the discrete SLJ bound guarantees the existence of a covering array with only 8117 rows.
The density algorithm replaces the loop at line 6 of Algorithm 2 by a conditional expectation derandomized method. For fixed v and t the density algorithm selects a row efficiently (time polynomial in k) and
deterministically that is guaranteed to cover at least duv −t e previously uncovered interactions. In practice,
for small values of k the density algorithm works quite well, often covering many more interactions than
the minimum. Many of the currently best known CAN(t, k, v) upper bounds are obtained by the density
algorithm in combination with various post-optimization techniques [13].
However, the practical applicability of Algorithm 2 and the density algorithm is limited by the storage
of the table T , representing each of the kt v t interactions. Even when t = 6, v = 3, and k = 54, there are
18,828,003,285 6-way interactions. This huge memory requirement renders the density algorithm impractical
for rather small values of k when t ∈ {5, 6} and v ≥ 3. We present an idea to circumvent this large
requirement for memory, and develop it in full in Section 3.

2.1

Why does a two stage based strategy make sense?

Compare the two extremes, the density algorithm and Algorithm 1. On one hand, Algorithm 1 does not suffer
from any substantial storage restriction, but appears to generate many more rows than the density algorithm.
On the other hand, the density algorithm constructs fewer rows for small values of k, but becomes impractical
when k is moderately large. One wants algorithms that behave like Algorithm 1 in terms of memory, but
yield a number of rows competitive with the density algorithm.
For t = 6, k = 16, and v = 3, Figure 2 compares the coverage profile for the density algorithm and
Algorithm 1. We plot the number of newly covered interactions for each row in the density algorithm, and
the expected number of newly covered interactions for each row for Algorithm 1. The qualitative features
exhibited by this plot are representative of the rates of coverage for other parameters.
Two key observations are suggested by Figure 2. First, the expected coverage in the initial random rows
is similar to the rows chosen by the density algorithm. In this example, the partial arrays consisting of the
first 1000 rows exhibit similar coverage, yet the randomized algorithm needed no extensive bookkeeping.
Secondly, as later rows are added, the judicious selections of the density algorithm produce much larger
coverage per row than Algorithm 1. Consequently it appears sensible to invest few computational resources

A specific covering array construction algorithm results by specifying the randomized method in the first
stage, the deterministic method in the second stage, and the computation of n and ρ. Any such algorithm
produces a covering array, but we wish to make selections so that the resulting algorithms are practical while
still providing a guarantee on the size of the array. In Section 3 we describe different algorithms from the
two-stage family, determine the size of the partial array to be constructed in the first stage, and establish
upper bound guarantees. In Section 4 we explore how good the algorithms are in practice.

Two-stage framework

For the first stage we consider two methods:
Rand
MT

the basic randomized algorithm
the Moser-Tardos type algorithm

We defer the development of method MT until Section 5. Method Rand uses a simple variant of Algorithm
1, choosing a random n × k array.
For the second stage we consider four methods:

naı̈ve strategy, one row per uncovered interaction

graph coloring algorithm

Using these abbreviations, we adopt a uniform naming convention for the algorithms: TS hA, Bi is the algorithm in which A is used in the first stage, and B is used in the second stage. For example, TS hMT, Greedyi
denotes a two-stage algorithm where the first stage is a Moser-Tardos type randomized algorithm and the
second stage is a greedy coloring algorithm. Later when the need arises we refine these algorithm names.

3.1

One row per uncovered interaction in the second stage (TS hRand, Naivei)

In the second stage each of the uncovered interactions after the first stage is covered using a new row.
Algorithm 4 describes the method in more detail.
This simple strategy improves on the basic randomized strategy when n is chosen judiciously. For
example, when t = 6, k = 54 and v = 3, Algorithm 1 constructs a covering array with 17, 236 rows. Figure
3 plots an upper bound on the size of the covering array against the number n of rows in the partial array.

more rows than the discrete SLJ bound, that is, 2-6% more rows.
To ensure that the loop in line 7 of Algorithm 4 does not repeat too many times we need to know the
probability with which a random n × k array leaves at most ρ interactions uncovered. Using Chebyshev’s
inequality and the second moment method developed in [2, Chapter 4], we next show that in a random n ×
nk
array the number of uncovered interactions is almost always close to its expectation, i.e. kt v t 1 − v1t .
Substituting the value of n from line 1, this expected value is equal to µ, as in line 2. Therefore, the probability
that a random n × k array covers the desired number of interactions is constant, and the expected number
of times the loop in line 7 is repeated is also a constant (around 2 in practice).

10

Because the theory of the second moment method is developed
considerable detail in [2], here we briefly
Pin

mention the relevant concepts and results. Suppose that X = i=1 Xi , where Xi is the indicator random
variable for event Ai for 1 ≤ i ≤ m. For indices i, j, we write i ∼ j if i 6= j and the events Ai , Aj are not
independent. Also suppose that X1 , . . . , Xm are symmetric, i.e. for every i 6= j there is a measure
preserving

mapping of the underlying probability space that sends event Ai to event Aj . Define ∆∗ = j∼i Pr [Aj |Ai ].
Then by [2, Corollary 4.3.4]:
Lemma 3. [2] If E[X] → ∞ and ∆∗ = o(E[X]) then X ∼ E[X] almost always.
In our case, Ai denotes the event that the ith interaction is not covered in a n × k array where each entry

is chosen independently and uniformly at random from a v-ary alphabet. Then Pr[Xi ] = 1 − v1t . Because

n × k array is close to the expected number of uncovered interactions. This guarantees that Algorithm 4 is
an efficient randomized algorithm for constructing covering arrays with a number of rows upper bounded by
Theorem 2.
In keeping with the general two-stage framework, Algorithm 4 does not store the coverage status of
each interaction. We only need store the interactions that are uncovered in A, of which there are at most

algorithm can be applied to a higher range of k values.

are relevant for practical application, Theorem 2 provides better results. Figure 5 compares the bounds on
CAN(t, k, v) with the currently best known results.

The density algorithm in the second stage (TS hRand, Deni)

Next we apply the density algorithm in the second stage. Figure 6 plots an upper bound on the size of the
covering array against the size of the partial array constructed in the first stage when the density algorithm
is used in the second stage, and compares it with TS hRand, Naivei. The size of the covering array decreases
11

as n decreases. This is expected because with smaller partial arrays, more interactions remain for the second
stage to be covered by the density algorithm. In fact if we cover all the interactions using the density
algorithm (as when n = 0) we would get an even smaller covering array. However, our motivation was
precisely to avoid doing that. Therefore, we need a ”cut-off” for the first stage.

Figure 6: Comparison of covering array sizes from two-stage algorithms with Den and Naive in the second
stage. With Den there is no minimum point in the curve; the size of the covering array keeps decreasing as
we leave more uncovered interactions for the second stage.
We are presented with a trade-off. If we construct a smaller partial array in the first stage, we obtain a
smaller covering array overall. But we then pay for more storage and computation time for the second stage.
To appreciate the nature of this trade-off, look at Figure 7, which plots an upper bound on the covering
array size and the number of uncovered interactions in the first stage against n. The improvement in the
covering array size plateaus after a certain point. The three horizontal lines indicate ρ (≈ v t ), 2ρ and 3ρ
uncovered interactions in the first stage. (In the naı̈ve method of Section 3.1, the partial array after the first
stage leaves at most ρ uncovered interactions.) In Figure 7 the final covering array size appears to plateau
when the number of uncovered interactions left by the first stage is around 2ρ. After that we see diminishing
returns — the density algorithm needs to cover more interactions in return for a smaller improvement in the
covering array size.
Let r be the maximum number of interactions allowed to remain uncovered after the first stage. Then r
can be specified in the two-stage algorithm. To accommodate this, we denote by TS hA, B; ri the two-stage
algorithm where A is the first stage strategy, B is the second stage strategy, and r is the maximum number
of uncovered interactions after the first stage. For example, TS hRand, Den; 2ρi applies the basic randomized
algorithm in the first stage to cover all but at most 2ρ interactions, and the density algorithm to cover the
remaining interactions in the second stage.

3.3

Coloring in the second stage (TS hRand, Coli and TS hRand, Greedyi)

Now we describe strategies using graph coloring in the second stage. Construct a graph G = (V, E), the
incompatibility graph, in which V is the set of uncovered interactions, and there is an edge between two

interactions exactly when they share a column in which they have different symbols. A single row can cover
a set of interactions if and only if it forms an independent set in G. Hence the minimum number of rows
required to cover all interactions of G is exactly its chromatic number χ(G), the minimum number of colors
in a proper coloring of G. Graph coloring is an NP-hard problem, so we employ heuristics to bound the
chromatic number. Moreover, G only has vertices for the uncovered interactions after the first stage, so is
size is small relative to the total number of interactions.

the chromatic number χ ≤ 12 + 2m + 14 , where m is the number of edges [16, Chapter 5.2], we can surely
q
cover the remaining interactions with at most 12 + 2m + 14 rows.
The actual number of edges m that remain after the first stage is a random variable with mean γ. In
principle, the first stage could be repeatedly applied until m ≤ γ, so we call m = γ the optimistic estimate.
To ensure that the first stage is expected to be run a small constant number of times, we increase the
estimate. With probability more than 1/2 the incompatibility graph has m ≤ 2γ edges, so m = 2γ is the
conservative estimate.
For t = 6, k = 56, and v = 3, Figure 8 shows the effect on the minimum number of rows when the bound
on the chromatic number in the second stage is used, for the conservative or optimistic estimates. The Naı̈ve
method is plotted for comparison. Better coloring bounds shift the minima leftward, reducing the number
of rows produced in both stages.
Thus far we have considered bounds on the chromatic number. Better estimation of χ(G) is complicated
by the fact that we do not have much information about the structure of G until the first stage is run. In
practice, however, G is known after the first stage and hence an algorithmic method to bound its chromatic
number can be applied. Because the number of vertices in G equals the number of uncovered interactions

after the first stage, we encounter the same trade-off between time and storage, and final array size, as seen
earlier for density. Hence we again parametrize by the expected number of uncovered interactions in the
first stage.
We employ two different greedy algorithms to color the incompatibility graph. In method Col we first
construct the incompatibility graph G after the first stage. Then we apply the commonly used smallest last
order heuristic to order the vertices for greedy coloring: At each stage, find a vertex vi of minimum degree
in Gi , order the vertices of Gi − vi , and then place vi at the end. More precisely, we order the vertices of G
as v1 , v2 , . . . , vn , such that vi is a vertex of minimum degree in Gi , where Gi = G − {vi+1 , . . . , vn }. A graph
is d-degenerate if all of its subgraphs have a vertex with degree at most d. When G is d-degenerate but not
(d − 1)-degenerate, the Coloring number col(G) is d + 1. If we then greedily color the vertices with the first
available color, at most col(G) colors are used.
In method Greedy we employ an on-line, greedy approach that colors the interactions as they are discovered in the first stage. In this way, the incompatibility graph is never constructed. We instead maintain a set
of rows. Some entries in rows are fixed to a specific value; others are flexible to take on any value. Whenever
a new interaction is found to be uncovered in the first stage, we check if any of the rows is compatible with
this interaction. If such a row is found then entries in the row are fixed so that the row now covers the
interaction. If no such row exists, a new row with exactly t fixed entries corresponding to the interaction is
added to the set of rows. This method is much faster than method Col in practice.

3.4

Using group action

Covering arrays that are invariant under the action of a permutation group on their symbols can be easier
to construct and are often smaller [15]. Direct and computational constructions using group actions are
explored in [9, 28]. Sarkar et al. [33] establish the asymptotically tightest known bounds on CAN(t, k, v)
using group actions. In this section we explore the implications of group actions on two-stage algorithms.
Let Γ be a permutation group on the set of symbols. The action of this group partitions the set of
t-way interactions into orbits. We construct an array A such that for every orbit, at least one row covers
an interaction from that orbit. Then we develop the rows of A over Γ to obtain a covering array that is
invariant under the action of Γ. Effort then focuses on covering all the orbits of t-way interactions, instead
of the individual interactions.
If Γ acts sharply transitively
on the set of symbols

 (for example, if Γ is a cyclic group of order v) then
the action of Γ partitions kt v t interactions into kt v t−1 orbits of length v each. Following

Similarly, we can employ a Frobenius group. When v is a prime power, the Frobenius group is the group
of permutations of Fv of the form {x 7→ ax + b : a, b ∈ Fv , a 6= 0}. The action of the Frobenius group
t−1
partitions the set of t-tuples on v symbols into v v−1−1 orbits of length v(v − 1) (full orbits) each and 1 orbit
of length v (a short orbit). The short orbit consists of tuples of the form (x1 , . . . , xt ) where x1 = . . . = xt .
Therefore, we can obtain a covering array by first constructing an array that covers all the full orbits, and
then developing all the rows over the Frobenius group and adding v constant rows. Using the two stage
strategy in conjunction with the Frobenius group action we obtain:

t = 6, v = 3 and 50 ≤ k ≤ 75. Group action reduces the required number of rows slightly.
Figure 9 compares the simple two-stage bound with the cyclic and Frobenius two-stage bounds. For
t = 6, v = 3 and 12 ≤ k ≤ 100, the cyclic bound requires 7-21 (on average 16) fewer rows than the simple
bound. In the same range the Frobenius bound requires 17 − 51 (on average 40) fewer rows.
Group action can be applied in other methods for the second stage as well. Colbourn [15] incorporates
group action into the density algorithm, allowing us to apply method Den in the second stage.
Greedy extends easily to use group action, as we do not construct an explicit incompatibility graph.
Whenever we fix entries in a row to cover an uncovered orbit, we commit to a specific orbit representative.
However, applying group action to the incompatibility graph coloring for Col is more complicated. We
need to modify the definition of the incompatibility graph for two reasons. First the vertices no longer
represent uncovered interactions, but rather uncovered orbits of interaction. Secondly, and perhaps more
importantly, pairwise compatibility between every two orbits in a set no longer implies mutual compatibility
among all orbits in the set.
One approach is to form a vertex for each uncovered orbit, placing an edge between two when they share
a column. Rather than the usual coloring, however, one asks for a partition of the vertex set into classes so
that every class induces an acyclic subgraph. Problems of this type are generalized graph coloring problems
[4]. Within each class of such a vertex partition, consistent representatives of each orbit can be selected to
form a row; when a cycle is present, this may not be possible. Unfortunately, heuristics for solving these
types of problems appear to be weak, so we adopt a second approach. As we build the incompatibility
graph, we commit to specific orbit representatives. When a vertex for an uncovered orbit is added, we check
its compatibility with the orbit representatives chosen for the orbits already handled with which it shares
columns; we commit to an orbit representative and add edges to those with which it is now incompatible.
Once completed, we have a (standard) coloring problem for the resulting graph.
Because group action can be applied using each of the methods for the two stages, we extend our naming
to TS hA, B; r, Γi, where Γ can be Trivial (i.e. no group action), Cyclic, or Frobenius.

Computational results

Figure 5 indicates that even a simple two-stage bound can improve on best known covering array numbers.
Therefore we investigate the actual performance of our two-stage algorithms for covering arrays of strength
5 and 6.
First we present results for t = 6, when v ∈ {3, 4, 5, 6} and no group action is assumed. Table 1 shows the
results for different v values. In each case we select the range of k values where the two-stage bound predicts
smaller covering arrays than
 previously known best ones, setting the maximum number of uncovered
 tthe
v
interactions as ρ = 1/ log vt −1 ≈ v t . For each value of k we construct a single partial array and then run
the different second stage algorithms on it consecutively. In this way all the second stage algorithms cover
the same set of uncovered interactions.
The column tab lists the best known CAN(t, k, v) upper bounds from [13]. The column bound shows the
upper bounds obtained from the two-stage bound (2). The columns naı̈ve, greedy, col and den show results
obtained from running the TS hRand, Naive; ρ, Triviali, TS hRand, Greedy; ρ, Triviali, TS hRand, Col; ρ, Triviali
and TS hRand, Den; ρ, Triviali algorithms, respectively.
The naı̈ve method always finds a covering array that is smaller than the two-stage bound. This happens
because we repeat the first stage of Algorithm 4 until the array has fewer than v t uncovered interactions.
(If the first stage were not repeated, the algorithm still produce covering arrays that are not too far from
the bound.) For v = 3 Greedy and Den have comparable performance. Method Col produces covering arrays
that are smaller. However, for v ∈ {4, 5, 6} Den and Col are competitive.
Table 2 shows the results obtained by the different second stage algorithms when the maximum number
of uncovered interactions in the first stage is set to 2ρ and 3ρ respectively. When more interactions are
covered in the second stage, we obtain smaller arrays as expected. However, the improvement in size does
not approach 50%. There is no clear winner.
Next we investigate the covering arrays that are invariant under the action of a cyclic group. In Table 3 the
column bound shows the upper bounds from Equation (1). The columns naı̈ve, greedy, col and den show
results obtained from running TS hRand, Naive; ρ, Cyclici, TS hRand, Greedy; ρ, Cyclici, TS hRand, Col; ρ, Cyclici
and TS hRand, Den; ρ, Cyclici, respectively.
Table 4 presents results for cyclic group action based algorithms when the number of maximum uncovered
interactions in the first stage is set to 2ρ and 3ρ respectively.
For the Frobenius group action, we show results only for v ∈ {3, 5} in Table 5. The column bound shows
the upper bounds obtained from Equation (2).
Table 6 presents results for Frobenius group action algorithms when the number of maximum uncovered
interactions in the first stage is 2ρ or 3ρ.
Next we present a handful of results when t = 5. In the cases examined, using the trivial group action
is too time consuming to be practical. However, the cyclic or Frobenius cases are feasible. Tables 7 and 8
compare two stage algorithms when the number of uncovered interactions in the first stage is at most 2ρ.
In almost all cases there is no clear winner among the three second stage methods. Methods Den and
Greedy are, however, substantially faster and use less memory than method Col; for practical purposes they
would be preferred.

Limited dependence and the Moser-Tardos algorithm

Here we explore a different randomized algorithm that produces smaller covering arrays than Algorithm 1.
When k > 2t, there are interactions that share no column. The events of coverage of such interactions are
independent. Moser et al. [29, 30] provide an efficient randomized construction method that exploits this

limited dependence. Specializing their method to covering arrays, we obtain Algorithm 5. For the specified
value of N in the algorithm it is guaranteed that the expected number of times the loop in line 3 of Algorithm
5 is repeated is linearly bounded in k (See Theorem 1.2 of [30]).
The upper bound on CAN(t, k, v) guaranteed by Algorithm 5 is obtained by applying the Lovász local
lemma (LLL).
Lemma 4. (Lovász local lemma; symmetric case) (see [2]) Let A1 , A2 , . . . , An events in an arbitrary probability space. Suppose that each event Ai is mutually independent of a set of all other events Aj except for at
most d, and that Pr[Ai ] ≤ p for all 1 ≤ i ≤ n. If ep(d + 1) ≤ 1, then Pr[∩ni=1 Āi ] > 0.
The symmetric version of Lovász local lemma provides an upper bound on the probability of a “bad”
event in terms of the maximum degree of a bad event in a dependence graph, so that the probability that
all the bad events are avoided is non zero. Godbole, Skipper, and Sunley [18] apply Lemma 4 essentially to
obtain the bound on CAN(t, k, v) in line 1 of Algorithm 5.

The bound on the size of covering arrays obtained from Theorem 5 is asymptotically tighter than the
one obtained from Theorem 1. Figure 10 compares the bounds for t = 6 and v = 3.
The original proof of LLL is essentially non-constructive and does not immediately lead to a polynomial
time construction algorithm for covering arrays satisfying the bound of Theorem 5. Indeed no previous
construction algorithms appear to be based on it. However the Moser-Tardos method of Algorithm 5 does
provide a construction algorithm running in expected polynomial time. For sufficiently large values of k
Algorithm 5 produces smaller covering arrays than the Algorithm 1.
But the question remains: Does Algorithm 5 produce smaller covering arrays than the currently best
known results within the range that it can be effectively computed? Perhaps surprisingly, we show that
the answer is affirmative. In Algorithm 5 we do not need to store the coverage information of individual
interactions in memory because each time an uncovered interaction is encountered we re-sample the columns
involved in that interaction and start the check afresh (checking the coverage in interactions in the same
order each time). Consequently, Algorithm 5 can be applied for larger values of k than the density algorithm.

Smaller covering arrays can be obtained by exploiting a group action using LLL, as shown in [33]. Table
9 shows the sizes of the covering arrays constructed by a variant of Algorithm 5 that employs cyclic and
Frobenius group actions. While this single stage algorithm produces smaller arrays than the currently best
known [13], these are already superseded by the two-stage based algorithms.

5.1

Moser-Tardos type algorithm for the first stage

The linearity of expectation arguments used in the SLJ bounds permit one to consider situations in which
a few of the “bad” events are allowed to occur, a fact that we exploited in the first stage of the algorithms
thus far. However, the Lovász local lemma does not address this situation directly. The conditional Lovász
local lemma (LLL) distribution, introduced in [19], is a very useful tool.
Lemma 6. (Conditional LLL distribution; symmetric case) (see [2, 33]) Let A = {A1 , A2 , . . . , Al } be a set
of l events in an arbitrary probability space. Suppose that each event Ai is mutually independent of a set of
all other events Aj except for at most d, and that Pr[Ai ] ≤ p for all 1 ≤ i ≤ l. Also suppose that ep(d+1) ≤ 1
(Therefore, by LLL (Lemma 4) Pr[∩li=1 Āi ] > 0). Let B ∈
/ A be another event in the same probability space

of k the standard two-stage bound is tighter than the LLL based two-stage bound. In practical terms, this
specific LLL based two-stage method does not look very promising, unless the parameters are quite large.

Conclusion and open problems

Many concrete algorithms within a two-stage framework for covering array construction have been introduced
and evaluated. The two-stage approach extends the range of parameters for which competitive covering arrays
can be constructed, each meeting an a priori guarantee on its size. Indeed as a consequence a number of
best known covering arrays have been improved upon. Although each of the methods proposed has useful
features, our experimental evaluation suggests that TS hRand, Greedy; 2ρ, Γi and TS hRand, Den; 2ρ.Γi with
Γ ∈ {Cyclic, Frobenius} realize a good trade-off between running time and size of the constructed covering
array.
Improvements in the bounds, or in the algorithms that realize them, are certainly of interest. We
mention some specific directions. Establishing tighter bounds on the coloring based methods of Section 3.3
is a challenging problem. Either better estimates of the chromatic number of the incompatibility graph after
a random first stage, or a first stage designed to limit the chromatic number, could lead to improvements in
the bounds.
In Section 5.1 and 5.2 we explored using a Moser-Tardos type algorithm for the first stage. Although this
is useful for asymptotic bounds, practical improvements appear to be limited. Perhaps a different approach of

reducing the number of bad events to be avoided explicitly by the algorithm may lead to a better algorithm.
A potential approach may look like following: “Bad” events would denote non-coverage of an interaction
over a t-set of columns. We would select a set of column t-sets such that the dependency graph of the
corresponding bad events have a bounded maximum degree (less than the original dependency graph). We
would devise a Moser-Tardos type algorithm for covering all the interactions on our chosen column t-sets,
and then apply the conditional LLL distribution to obtain an upper bound on the number of uncovered
interactions. However, the difficulty lies in the fact that “all vertices have degree ≤ ρ” is a non-trivial,
“hereditary” property for induced subgraphs, and for such properties finding a maximum induced subgraph
with the property is an NP-hard optimization problem [17]. There is still hope for a randomized or “nibble”
like strategy that may find a reasonably good induced subgraph with a bounded maximum degree. Further
exploration of this idea seems to be a promising research avenue.
In general, one could consider more than two stages. Establishing the benefit (or not) of having more
than two stages is also an interesting open problem. Finally, the application of the methods developed to
mixed covering arrays appears to provide useful techniques for higher strengths; this merits further study as
well.

ABSTRACT

Screening: Which factors and interactions are most inﬂuential on
a response?

The purpose of a screening experiment is to identify signiﬁcant factors and interactions on a response for a system. Engineered systems are complex in part due to their size. To apply traditional
experimental designs for screening in complex engineered systems
requires either restricting the factors considered, which automatically restricts the interactions to those in the set, or restricting interest to main effects, which fails to consider any possible interactions. To address this problem we propose a locating array (LA) as
a screening design. Locating arrays exhibit logarithmic growth in
the number of factors because their focus is on identiﬁcation rather
than on measurement. This makes practical the consideration of an
order of magnitude more factors in experimentation than traditional
screening designs. We present preliminary results applying an LA
for screening the response of TCP throughput in a simulation model
of a mobile wireless network. The full-factorial design for this system is infeasible (over 1043 design points!) yet an LA has only 421
design points. We validate the signiﬁcance of the identiﬁed factors
and interactions independently using the statistical software JMP.
Screening using locating arrays is viable and yields useful models.

Conﬁrmation: Is the system currently performing in the same way
as it did in the past?
Discovery: What happens when new operating conditions, materials, factors, etc., are explored?
Robustness: Under what conditions does a response degrade?
Stability: How can variability in a response be reduced?
Our focus is on screening using techniques from statistical design
of experiments (DoE). DoE refers to the process of planning an
experiment so that appropriate data are collected and analyzed by
statistical methods, in order to result in valid and objective conclusions. Hence any experimental problem includes both the design of
the experiment and the statistical analysis of the data.
Suppose that there are k factors, F1 , . . . , Fk , and that each factor
Fj has a set Lj = {vj,1 , . . . , vj,j }, of j possible levels (or values). A design point is an assignment of a level from Lj to Fj ,
for each factor j = 1, . . . , k. An experimental design is a collection of design points. When a design has N design points, it
can be represented by an N × k array A = (ai,j ) in which each
row i corresponds to a design point and each column j to a factor;
the entry ai,j gives the level assigned to factor j in the ith design
point. When run, a design point results in one or more observable
responses.

INTRODUCTION

Computer and networked systems are examples of complex engineered systems (CESs). The complexity of an engineered system is
not just due to its size, but also arises from its structure, operation
(including control and management), evolution over time, and that
people are involved in its design and operation [35].

When the objective of experimentation is screening, it is often recommended to keep the number of factors low. It has been considered impractical to experiment with “many” factors; about ten
factors is a suggested maximum [23, 31]. Generally, two levels for
each factor is considered to work well in screening experiments.

Experimentation is often used to study the performance of CESs.
At its most basic, a system may be viewed as transforming some
input variables, or factors, into one or more observable output variables, or responses. Some factors of a system are controllable,
whereas others are not.

Methods for screening seek to reduce the number of design points
required because the exhaustive full-factorial design [9, 31] is too
large. For k factors each with two levels it has 2k design points.
An analysis of variance (ANOVA) allows the signiﬁcant factors
and interactions on the response to be identiﬁed.

Objectives of experimentation include:

generators, expressions of factors that are confounded; the generators determine the alias structure. A design is of resolution R if no
m-factor effect is aliased with another effect containing fewer than
R − m factors.

The rest of this paper is organized as follows. §2 deﬁnes a locating
array, and gives an example of how a design is used for location.
§3 presents preliminary results applying an LA for screening the response of TCP throughput in a simulation model of a mobile wireless network. The full-factorial design for this system is infeasible
— it has over 1043 design points! Yet there is an LA with only 421
design points. We develop an algorithm using the LA to identify
the signiﬁcant factors and interactions from the data collected, providing a small example. In §4 we validate the signiﬁcance of the
identiﬁed factors and interactions independently using the statistical software JMP. Finally, in §5 we summarize, discuss potential
threats to our approach, directions for this research, and conclude.

A D-optimal design is a popular experimental design among those
using optimality criteria. A model to ﬁt, and a bound N on the
number of design points, must be speciﬁed a priori; this restricts
the factors to be analyzed to those in the model. The size of a Doptimal design is bounded by the size of a full-factorial design.
Some designs aggregate the factors into groups, e.g., sequential bifurcation [24], to improve design efﬁciency. Grouping requires care
to ensure that factor effects do not cancel. This presents a “chicken
and egg” problem: we need to know how to group in order to group.
Often, a domain expert is expected to make such grouping decisions. While such experts may have considerable knowledge, it
is doubtful whether an expert knows the importance of a speciﬁc
factor or interaction in a CES.

2.

An interaction graph depicts how a change in the level of one factor
affects the other factor with respect to a response. Figure 1 shows
an interaction graph for the factors of routing and medium access
control (MAC) protocol on average delay in a network. The choice
of MAC protocol (EDCF or IEEE 802.11) has little impact on the
average delay in the AODV routing protocol, while for the DSR
routing protocol the impact is very large; see [53]. If MAC protocols were aggregated, this signiﬁcant interaction would be lost.

LAs differ from standard designed experiments, which are used to
measure interactions and to develop a model for the response as a
function of these [31]. “Search designs” [17, 48, 49] also attempt
to locate interactions of higher strength, but their focus remains on
measurement and hence on balanced designs. Rao [20] shows that
the number of design points in a balanced design must be at least
as large as the number of interactions considered. Thus if t-way
interactions among k factors each having v levels are to be examined, balanced designs only reduce the v k exhaustive design points
to O(kt ). The selection of few factors from hundreds of candidates by this reduction is not viable. By lessening the requirement
from measurement to identiﬁcation, LAs are not subject to the Rao
bound.

LOCATING ARRAYS

Reducing the number of design points required relies on a sparsity
of effects assumption, that interactions of interest involve at most
a small, known number t of interacting factors. As one means of
reduction, we deﬁne locating arrays (LAs) [8]. For a set of factors
each taking on a number of levels, an LA permits the identiﬁcation
of a small number of signiﬁcant interactions among small sets of
(factor, level) combinations.

EDCF
IEEE 802.11

Fortunately LAs behave more like covering arrays, experimental
designs in which every t-way interaction among factors appears in
at least one design point. Unlike designed experiments, the number
of design points in a covering array for k factors grows as a logarithmic function of k (see [43], for example). In [8], a construction
of LAs using covering arrays of higher strength is given, and hence
LAs also exhibit this logarithmic growth, making them asymptotically much more efﬁcient than balanced designs. This motivates
the consideration of covering arrays, which have been the subject
of extensive study [4, 5, 19, 36]. They are used in testing software
[10,13,25,26], hardware [46,50], composite materials [3], biological networks [44, 47], and others. Their use to facilitate location of
interactions is examined in [29, 56], and measurement in [21, 22].
Covering arrays form the basis for combinatorial methods to learn
an unknown classiﬁcation function using few evaluations — these
arise in computational learning and classiﬁcation, and hinge on locating the relevant attributes (factors) [11]. Algorithms for generating covering arrays range from greedy (e.g., [2, 16]) through
heuristic search (e.g., [38, 52]). However, combinatorial constructions (see [5]) provide the only available deterministic means of
producing covering arrays with more than a few hundred factors.

A fractional factorial design is saturated when it investigates k =
N − 1 factors in N design points [31]. In a supersaturated design,
the number of factors k > N − 1; such designs contain more factors than design points. These designs are only able to estimate a
main effects model [27, 31]. Thus they cannot consider possible
interactions at all.
Even with substantial and detailed domain knowledge, it is imperative not to eliminate or aggregate factors a priori. Our goal,
therefore, is an automatic and objective approach to screening. To
address this problem we have formulated the deﬁnition of a locating array (LA) [8]. Locating arrays exhibit logarithmic growth in
the number of factors because their focus is on identiﬁcation rather
than on measurement. This makes practical the consideration of an
order of magnitude more factors in experimentation, removing the
need for the elimination of factors. As a result, LAs have the po-

A design point, when run, yields one or more responses. For ease
of exposition, we classify the responses in two groups, those that

32

exceed a speciﬁed threshold and those that do not. So we suppose
that the outcome of a run of a design point is a single binary response (“pass” or “fail”). A fault is caused by one or more t-way
interactions, and is evidenced by a run failing.

uous, we can select a threshold on the responses so as to limit the
number of design points yielding a “fail” outcome to locate those
that make the most substantial contribution to the response. We
exploit this fact later in §3.2.

Given an experimental design and the set of interactions that cause
faults, the outcomes can be easily calculated: A run fails exactly
when it contains one or more of the faulty interactions, and does
not fail otherwise. In order to observe a fault, the interaction must
be covered by at least one design point. With no restriction on the
interactions that can cause faults, every interaction
 must be covered. Then the best one can do is to form all kj=1 j possible
design points, the exhaustive design. Using sparsity of effects, an
upper bound t is placed on the strength of interactions that may be
faulty. Then we require that every t-way interaction be covered; in
other words, the design is a covering array of strength t.

An example is provided to demonstrate fault location, and show
the limitations of covering arrays for this purpose. Suppose that
we use the experimental design for ﬁve binaryfactors

interactions is covered. A response for each design point run is
listed in the adjacent column.
Table 1: Experimental design and response for each run.

Let A = (ai,j ) be an experimental design, an N × k array where in
each row i, levels in the jth column are chosen from a set Lj of size
j . For array A and t-way interaction T = {(ij , νij ) : 1 ≤ j ≤ t},
deﬁne ρ(A, T ) = {r : ar,ij = νij , 1 ≤ j ≤ t} as the set of
rows of A in which T is covered. For a set T of interactions,
ρ(A, T ) = ∪T ∈T ρ(A, T ). Locating faults requires that T be
recovered from ρ(A, T ), whenever T is a possible set of faults.

First, let us locate faults due to main effects (i.e., the individual factors or one-way interactions). The second design point run passes,
so all (factor, level) pairs in it are known not to be faulty. Therefore
in Table 2(a), that considers only the second design point, when
factor 1 is set to one, the run is not faulty. Similarly, for factors
2, 3, 4, and 5 set to zero, one, zero, and zero, respectively. This
is indicated by a check-mark () in the table. Repeating to check
coverage of each one-way interaction for each successful run, no
single (factor, level) error accounts for the faults; see Table 2(b).

Let It be the set of all t-way interactions for an array, and let It
be the set of all interactions of strength at most t. Consider an
interaction T ∈ It of strength less than t. Any interaction T 
of strength t that contains T necessarily has ρ(A, T  ) ⊆ ρ(A, T ).
In this case, when T is faulty we are unable to determine whether
or not T  is also faulty. Call a subset T  of interactions in It
independent if there do not exist T, T  ∈ T  with T ⊆ T  . In
general, some interactions in It (or perhaps It ) are believed to
be faulty, but their number and identity are unknown. The faulty
interactions cannot be identiﬁed precisely from the outcomes, even
if the full factorial design is employed, without some restriction
on their number. (Consider the situation in which every design
point run fails.) We therefore suppose that a maximum number d
of faulty interactions is speciﬁed.

Computing ρ(T ) for every one-way interaction, we obtain the sets
in Table 3. Because no two sets are equal, the array is (1, 1)locating and when there is a single faulty one-way interaction it can
be located. However, because {1, 3, 5} ∪ {2, 3, 5} = {1, 3, 5} ∪
{1, 2}, when rows 1, 3, and 5 fail and 2, 4, and 6 pass, we cannot determine the two faulty interactions — the array is not (2, 1)locating.

If there is any set of d interactions of strength t that produce exactly the outcomes obtained when using a (d, t)-locating array A
to conduct experiments, then there is exactly one such set of interactions. To avoid enumeration of all sets of d interactions of
strength t, one can employ a stronger condition that for every interaction T of strength at most T and every set T1 ⊆ It that does
not contain T and for which T1 ∪ {T } is independent, it holds that
ρ(A, T ) = ρ(A, T1 ) ⇔ T ∈ T1 . A locating array meeting this
stronger condition is termed a detecting array in [8]. When using
a detecting array, if there are at most d independent faulty interactions each of strength at most t, they are characterized precisely
as the interactions that appear in no run that passes. We typically
employ the term locating array to refer to both, but for reasons of
computational efﬁciency the locating arrays that we use are, in fact,
detecting arrays.

Now, let us try to locate faults due to two-way interactions. Because the second design point run passes, all two-way interactions
in it are known not to be faulty; Table 4(a) records the results. Repeating to check for coverage of each two-way interaction for each
successful run, those interactions not found to pass in this way in

In practice, one does not know a priori how many interactions are
faulty, or their strengths. Nevertheless, when responses are contin-

of levels for each factor to the desired number, eliminating rows in
the process and forming an array C with 143 design points. The
resulting array provides coverage of two-way interactions but does
not support location. When T and T  are interactions, to distinguish them we require that ρ(T ) = ρ(T  ), but we ask for more,
namely that |ρ(T ) \ ρ(T  )| ≥ 2 and |ρ(T  ) \ ρ(T )| ≥ 2; this ensures that for every two interactions of interest, there are at least
two design points containing one but not the other. To accomplish
this, we formed three copies of C, randomly permuted their symbols within each column, and formed their union (so that every
two-way interaction is covered at least three times). The resulting
array B with 429 rows turned out to be (1, 2)-detecting. Three rows
were selected by a greedy method to ensure the stronger condition
that |ρ(T ) \ ρ(T  )| ≥ 2 for every pair T, T  of interactions; then
eleven rows were deleted by a greedy algorithm to remove redundant rows, ultimately producing a design with 421 rows. Appendix
A gives a pointer to the locating array used as the experimental
design. Our objective was not to ﬁnd the smallest possible array,
because a fair evaluation of the efﬁcacy of locating arrays should
not rely on substantial additional structure being present.

Table 4(b) form a set of candidate faults. In this example, there are
nine interactions in the set of candidate faults. Now for the twoway interaction {(1, 0), (2, 1)}, ρ({(1, 0), (2, 1)}) = {1, 3}, and
it is the only two-way interaction for which this holds; and, no oneway interaction T has ρ(T ) = {1, 3}. Hence if there is a single
fault, it must be {(1, 0), (2, 1)}, and we have located the fault.

Ten replicates of each design point in the LA are run in ns-2;
for each a response of TCP throughput is measured. These are
averaged for each design point resulting in a vector with 421 entries
of observed average TCP throughput obsT h.

Our success for one response is not sufﬁcient, however. Because
ρ({(1, 0), (2, 1)}) = {1} = ρ({(2, 1), (3, 1)}), if only run 1 fails,
there are at least two equally plausible explanations using only a
single two-way interaction. Indeed A is not (1, 2)-locating. Thus
the ability to locate is more than simply coverage!

SCREENING AN ENGINEERED SYSTEM

We now apply locating arrays for screening in a complex engineered system. One example of a CES for which it has been particularly difﬁcult to develop models is a mobile ad hoc network
(MANET). A MANET is a collection of mobile wireless nodes that
self-organize without the use of any ﬁxed infrastructure or centralized control. We seek to use a locating array to screen for the inﬂuential factors and interactions on average transport control protocol
(TCP) throughput in a simulation model of a MANET.

3.1

Screening Algorithm

We describe an algorithm for screening at a high level to facilitate
understanding. In each iteration of the algorithm the most signiﬁcant main effect or two-way interaction is identiﬁed. These terms
are accumulated in a screening model of average TCP throughput. However, this screening model is not intended as a predictive
model; the quality of its current estimate allows the algorithm to
select the next most signiﬁcant term. The screening model is used
only to identify inﬂuential main effects and two-way interactions.
With its output, a predictive model can be built; see §4.
Initially, the screening model has no terms. With no other information, it should estimate the average TCP throughput to be the
average of the vector of observed average throughput. This is unlikely to be a very good estimation!

Designing the Experiment

We use the ns-2 simulator [37], version 2.34, for our experimentation. Since our response of interest is average TCP throughput,
we select the ﬁle transfer protocol (FTP) as our application because
it uses TCP for reliability. We select the internet protocol (IP), the
Ad hoc On-demand Distance Vector routing protocol (AODV) [42],
and IEEE 802.11b direct sequence spread spectrum (DSSS) as protocols at the network, data link, and physical layers of the protocol
stack. We also use the mobility, energy, error, and propagation
models in ns-2. From these protocols and models we identify
75 controllable factors. The region of interest for each factor, i.e.,
the range over which the factor is varied, ranges from two to ten
levels, with some set according to recommendations in [33]. See
Appendix A for a pointer to details of the factors and their levels.

Our strategy to identify the most signiﬁcant factor or interaction
as the term to add to the screening model is as follows. Suppose
that factor Fj , 1 ≤ k ≤ 75, has j levels Lj = {vj,1 , . . . vj,j }.
For each level , 1 ≤  ≤ j , of factor Fj iterate through each
of the 421 design points of the locating array A. For each design
point i, 1 ≤ i ≤ 421, partition the contribution of the (factor Fj ,
level vj, ) combination into one of two sets: S or S. If the design
point has the factor Fj set to level , i.e., ai,j = vj, , then add
the throughput measured for design point i, obsT h[i], to S; otherwise add obsT h[i] to S. Then, compute the (absolute) difference
of the average of sets S and S. (Of course, metrics other than the
difference of averages could be used.) Either the difference is zero
(i.e., the average TCP throughput collected in the sets S and S is
the same), or it is non-zero. If the difference is non-zero, then one
possible explanation is that the (factor Fj , level vj, ) combination
is responsible for the difference.

The full-factorial design for this factor space is infeasible; it has
over 1043 design points! In contrast, the locating array constructed
and checked manually has only 421 design points. Except for small
locating arrays [51], no general construction methods have been
published. We adopted a heuristic approach to construct the LA.

Our hypothesis is that the (factor Fj , level vj, ) combination over
all combinations for which the difference between the sets is the
greatest is the most signiﬁcant one. If this is correct, then a term
of the form c · (Fj , vj, ) is added to the screening model. The

Initially we selected a covering array with 75 factors and 10 levels
per factor, constructed using a standard product construction [7].
We applied a post-optimization method [34] to reduce the number

and S.

design point with this initial ﬁtted value.
Now, we iterate over each (factor,level) combination. Factor
1 is set

to its low level in design points 1–4. Therefore S = 14 41 resT h[i] =

−134347
= −33586 and S = 14 85 resT h[i] = 134344
= 33586.

4
The absolute difference, |S − S| = |-33586 − 33586| = 67172.

In the ﬁrst iteration of this algorithm, the estimate (i.e., the average
of the vector of observed average TCP throughput) is used to determine deviations from each entry in the vector obsT h. We now
have a screening model that apparently includes the most signiﬁcant factor. It is now used to produce a new estimate of average
TCP throughput and update the vector of residual throughput. The
algorithm can be applied repeatedly to the residuals to identify the
next most important factor or interaction.

Repeating for each (factor, level) combination, as well as all twoway interactions, we ﬁnd that it is a main effect that has highest
absolute difference with a value of 131255. It occurs when factor
3 is set to its lowest level, namely when the number of ﬂows at
the application layer is only one. Hence we attribute this as the
explanation for the largest difference and add the term c · (F3 , v3,0 )
to the model. The method of ordinary least squares (OLS) is used
to ﬁt the intercept and coefﬁcient c of the new term. This results
in an updated model of T = 12410 + 131255 · (F3 , v3,0 ). Its
coefﬁcient of determination is R2 = 0.33.

While this algorithm is described for (factor, level) combinations,
we actually iterate over all one-way (i.e., all (factor, level) combinations) and all two-way interactions (i.e., all pairs of (factor, level)
combinations) to identify the main effect or two-way interaction of
highest signiﬁcance. Any number of stopping conditions may be
used to decide when to terminate the model development. We use
the R2 , the coefﬁcient of determination, indicating how well data
ﬁts a line or curve; when it shows marginal improvement, we stop.

Using this updated model, the residuals can be recomputed as input
to the next iteration of the algorithm.
Next, we describe some of the obstacles arising in the practical
application of the screening algorithm.

The locating array constructed for our CES is a (d = 1, t = 2)locating array, meaning it only guarantees to be able to locate (identify) at most one (d = 1) main effect or two-way (i.e., up to t = 2way) interaction. It is interesting that the LA may be used iteratively to identify subsequent signiﬁcant main effects or interactions. In this sense, the algorithm uses a “heavy-hitters” approach
as in compressive sensing [6].

Applying the Screening Algorithm

In applying the screening algorithm to our CES, several obstacles
arose. The ﬁrst is that the measured average TCP throughput is not
normally distributed, as Figure 2 shows; this is not uncommon in
systems experimentation [12]. The best transformation of the data
is a natural logarithm (Figure 3a). From the normal probability plot
(Figure 3b), we ﬁnd that the transformed data are still not normally
distributed; nevertheless, we work with this transformation of the
data.

Example of the Screening Algorithm

A small example is provided to step through one iteration of the
screening algorithm. Suppose that we use the experimental design for four binary factors in Table 5. It is a covering array of
strength three and therefore also a (2, 1)-detecting array. Factor 1
corresponds to the distribution function used for introducing errors
(uniformly or exponentially distributed), factor 2 to the error rate
(10−7 or 10−5 ), factor 3 to the number of ﬂows at the application
layer (1 or 18), and factor 4 to the TCP packet size (64 or 2048);
the levels are taken as “binary” for this example. All remaining factors are set to their default levels for experimentation. A response
of observed TCP throughput for each design point, averaged over
ten replicates, is listed in the column obsT h. (All measures are
truncated to integers for simplicity.)

A much larger problem arises from the fact that the LA does not
cover each main effect and two-way interaction the same number
of times. Indeed, binary factors are covered much more frequently
(some as many as two hundred times in the 421 row LA) compared
to two-way interactions of factors with ten levels (only a handful
of times). This is unavoidable when one-way and two-way interactions are compared, and when factors have a different numbers of
levels.

The overall mean of the obsT h is 78038. Therefore, the screening
model initially estimates this value for average TCP throughput,
i.e., T = 78038. The residuals (resT h) are computed in Table 5 by
taking the difference of the observed average throughput for each

Consider the behaviour of the screening algorithm. For a binary
factor the sets S and S have the same or nearly the same size and,
as a result, the average of each set has small variance. In the example in §3.3, each (factor, level) combination is covered four times

(each column of the array has four zeros and four ones). However
in general, as the number of levels for a factor increases, the size of
the sets S and S may become markedly different, and the variance
of the average of each set may increase greatly. Returning to the
example in §3.3, the two-way interactions are not covered equally.
Consider the two-way interaction {(1, 0), (2, 0)}. It is covered in
only two rows of the array, namely |ρ({(1, 0), (2, 0)})| = |{1, 2}| =
2 (this is true for all two-way interactions in this example). Even
in this small array, the coverage of two-way interactions is unbalanced resulting in S accumulating two values and S accumulating
six values. This makes any direct comparison among (factor, level)
combinations and/or two-way interactions impossible.

Table 6: Screening model with twelve terms.

To address this problem, factors are grouped according to the number of times each level is covered in the LA; see Appendix A for
a pointer to the details on how groups are formed. Now, in each
iteration of the screening algorithm, the ﬁrst step is to select the
most signiﬁcant factor or interaction from each group. Then from
these candidates, the most signiﬁcant factor or interaction overall
is selected.
The Figure 4 shows the graphical tests for normality of the residuals after the ﬁrst iteration of the screening algorithm. (Similar behaviour of the residuals is observed after each iteration.) While the
ﬁgures indicate that the residuals are close to normally distributed,
we check using the non-parametric Shapiro-Wilk test. This test indicates that the residuals are still not normally distributed. Hence,
we use the Wilcoxon rank sum test and the Mann-Whitney U test [14, 28, 54] to select the most signiﬁcant factor or two-way
interaction within each group. Then, to select the most signiﬁcant factor or interaction over all groups, the Akaike information
criterion (AICC ) [1] is used.

The ﬁrst notable observation about this screening model is that it
contains both main effects and two-way interactions. Moreover, it
contains factors from across the layers of the protocol stack (application, transport, and MAC) and not just the transport layer; in
addition, it includes factors from the error model and the mobility model. Aside from these differences with other models of TCP
throughput (such as [15, 18, 30, 39–41, 55, 57, 58]), the screening
model includes not just which factors or two-way interactions are
signiﬁcant, but the level at which each is signiﬁcant.

We still need to ﬁt the intercept and the coefﬁcients of the terms.
For a linear model with the assumptions of expected error of zero
and expected variance in the error to be equal, the method of ordinary least squares (OLS) is used. However, if the expected variance
in the error is unequal, OLS is no longer appropriate [32]. In this
case, the method of weighted least squares (WLS) is used to ﬁt the
intercept and coefﬁcients of the terms in the screening model.

The Resulting Screening Model

its unique factors. A Student’s t-test was run on each term in the
screening model and each was found to be signiﬁcant; β0 is the

form distribution into packets rather than bit errors), and their interaction. Smaller sized packets (64 and 128 bytes) tend to reduce
throughput. When RTS/CTS is always on (i.e., the threshold is
zero bytes), there is a negative impact on throughput compared to
when it is conﬁgured to 1500 or 3000 bytes (always off). The retransmission timeout (RTO) and round trip time (RTT) are part of
TCP’s congestion control mechanism; the RTO infers packet loss
by observing duplicate acknowledgements and the RTT is related
to the propagation delay. The RTO is signiﬁcant by itself, and in
its interaction with the RTT as they work to correct and prevent
network congestion. The synthetic error model of the simulator
drops packets comparing them with data from an uniform distribution at a steady-state loss event rate of 1.0E-07; this is the lowest
error rate used and naturally it corresponds with higher throughput. Smaller simulation areas also result in higher throughput; a
larger area has longer average shortest-hop path lengths and average higher network partition rates both of which negatively affect
throughput. The throughput response is higher with fewer ﬂows
because increasing the number of ﬂows not only may overload the
network but more ﬂows are more challenging to route in a MANET.

VALIDATION AND VERIFICATION

From the 75 controllable factors used in experimentation, nine unique
factors are present in the twelve terms in the screening model in Table 6; these are listed in Table 8.

In order to validate the factors and interactions identiﬁed, we ﬁrst
conduct a full-factorial experiment for these nine factors using the
extremes of their region of interest, using the statistical software
JMP to analyze the results. From this, we produce a predictive
model of average TCP throughput. We then examine the quality
of this predictive model by comparing how it performs on random
design points (i.e., a design point in which the level of each factor
is selected at random).

in Table 6. Indeed, both models have the same four most signiﬁcant
terms (though in a different order), and all factors and interactions
in Table 6 are a subset of the terms in Table 9. Appendix A gives
a pointer to the details of the predictive model for average TCP
throughput that was ﬁt using a subset of the signiﬁcant terms in
Table 9.
Figure 5 shows the results of evaluating the JMP predictive model
as a function of the TCP packet size, for the three levels of error
rate. As in the experimentation, all remaining factors are ﬁxed at
their default levels. As expected, the results show that the highest
TCP throughput is achieved when the error rate is at the lowest level
(1.0E-07). For a given error rate the TCP throughput increases as
a function of packet size, after which it decreases. An exception
is for packet size 1024. Aside from this exception, these results
also conﬁrm our intuition of TCP throughput behaviour. The reason for this exception deserves further study but may be related to
the default settings used for the other 66 factors not varied in this
screening experiment.

We present our validation results next.

Full-Factorial Screening in JMP

We conduct an independent 29 full-factorial experiment on the nine
factors in Table 8. All remaining 75 − 9 = 66 factors are ﬁxed to
their default levels. Ten replicates of each of the 29 design points is
run, and TCP throughput measured. The results of the experimentation are input to the JMP statistical software, version 11.0 [45].
The results from the full-factorial screening experiment are given in
Table 9. It includes only the main effects and two-way interactions
sorted in increasing order by the p-value. The results indicate high
commonality with the main effects and two-factor interactions selected by the screening algorithm that formed the screening model

We now examine the predictive accuracy of the JMP model for random design points.

Despite this, the method aims only to deal with many factors and
their interactions to identify the signiﬁcant ones. We advocate that
further experimentation is necessary after the screening is completed, both to conﬁrm the screening results and to build a predictive model. One must be cautious not to over-ﬁt the experimental results and claim unwarranted conﬁdence; conﬁrmation is
needed. This is particularly a concern if the stopping criterion chosen locates too many or too few signiﬁcant interactions; while our
choice of R2 appears to have worked well, future effort should address the impact of different stopping criteria. A second concern is
the selection criterion for the next factor or interaction to include.
Subsequent selections depend upon selections already made, so our
method could in principle be misdirected by a bad selection. Our
criterion of using the differences between responses for S and those
for S has also worked well, but we cannot be certain that such a
simple selection sufﬁces in general. Finally, we have employed
only a few locating arrays; while they have worked well in our
analyses, constructing a suitable locating array remains a challenging problem that merits further research.

Predictive Accuracy of JMP Model

In order to test the predictive accuracy of the JMP model, a new
experimental design of one hundred random design points is constructed. In constructing each design point, for each of factor Fj ,
1 ≤ j ≤ 75, a random level from Lj is selected. New mobility
scenarios are also generated. Ten replicates of each of the random
design points are run in the ns-2 simulator, and the TCP throughput measured. In addition, for each experiment in the design, the
JMP model is evaluated generating a new data set of ﬁtted TCP
throughput.

Certainly further experimentation is needed to assess the merit of
screening using LAs, in particular on physical not just simulated
complex engineered systems, and draw ﬁrm conclusions. What we
can conclude is that in a challenging CES arising from a MANET,
screening using locating arrays is viable and yields useful models.

Figure 6 shows the average TCP throughput from simulation, and
the ﬁtted throughput from the JMP model corresponding to this
random design. The mean TCP throughput from the simulations is
20,892 bps whereas the mean from the JMP model is lower, only
13,946 bps. However, the standard deviation of the results from the
JMP model is smaller than the standard deviation from the simulations. Both models exhibit a few outliers. Approximately 94%
of the results predicted for TCP throughput from the JMP model
are in one standard deviation of the simulation results. Considering
the size of the factor space, we conclude that the predicted average
TCP throughput of the JMP model is similar to the average TCP
throughput measured in simulation.

Predictive Accuracy of Screening Model

While the model developed in applying the screening algorithm
based on the LA (Table 6) is not intended to be used as a predictive
model, we were curious about its predictive accuracy. Appendix
A gives a pointer to a summary of results similar to those in this
section for the screening model. To our surprise, the predictive accuracy of the screening model is reasonably good. The screening
model does appear to have more variability than the model developed in JMP.

CONCLUSIONS

Locating arrays capture the intuition that in order to see the effect of
a main effect or interaction, some design point must cover it; and in
order to distinguish it, the responses for the set of design points that
cover it must not be equally explained by another small set of main
effects or interactions. In a complex engineered system, many main
effects and interactions may be signiﬁcant, but our method identiﬁes them one at a time, iteratively improving a screening model. In
this way, an experimental design must be able to repeatedly locate
a single “most signiﬁcant” main effect or interaction. Our results
show that using locating arrays for screening appears promising.
Indeed while the screening targeted the identiﬁcation of signiﬁcant

Abstract
Modern software systems often consist of many different components, each with a number of options.
Although unit tests may reveal faulty options for individual components, functionally correct components
may interact in unforeseen ways to cause a fault. Covering arrays are used to test for interactions
among components systematically. A two-stage framework, providing a number of concrete algorithms,
is developed for the efficient construction of covering arrays. In the first stage, a time and memory
efficient randomized algorithm covers most of the interactions. In the second stage, a more sophisticated
search covers the remainder in relatively few tests. In this way, the storage limitations of the sophisticated
search algorithms are avoided; hence the range of the number of components for which the algorithm can
be applied is extended, without increasing the number of tests. Many of the framework instantiations
can be tuned to optimize a memory-quality trade-off, so that fewer tests can be achieved using more
memory. The algorithms developed outperform the currently best known methods when the number
of components ranges from 20 to 60, the number of options for each ranges from 3 to 6, and t-way
interactions are covered for t ∈ {5, 6}. In some cases a reduction in the number of tests by more than
50% is achieved.

Introduction

Real world software and engineered systems are composed of many different components, each with a number
of options, that are required to work together in a variety of circumstances. Components are factors, and
options for a component form the levels of its factor. Although each level for an individual factor can be tested
in isolation, faults in deployed software can arise from interactions among levels of different factors. When
an interaction involves levels of t different factors, it is a t-way interaction. Testing for faults caused by t-way
interactions for every t is generally infeasible, as a result of a combinatorial explosion. However, empirical
research on real world software systems indicates that testing all possible 2-way (or 3-way) interactions
would detect 70% (or 90%) of all faults [25]. Moreover, testing all possible 6-way interactions is sufficient
for detection of 100% of all faults in the systems examined in [25]. Testing all possible t-way interactions for
some 2 ≤ t ≤ 6 is pseudo-exhaustive testing [24], and is accomplished with a combinatorial array known as
a covering array.
Formally, let N, t, k, and v be integers with k ≥ t ≥ 2 and v ≥ 2. A covering array CA(N ; t, k, v) is an
N × k array A in which each entry is from a v-ary alphabet Σ, and for every N × t sub-array B of A and
every x ∈ Σt , there is a row of B that equals x. Then t is the strength of the covering array, k is the number
of factors, and v is the number of levels.
When k is a positive integer, [k] denotes the set {1, . . . , k}. A t-way interaction is {(ci , ai ) : 1 ≤ i ≤
t, ci ∈ [k], ci 6= cj for i 6= j, and ai ∈ Σ}. So an interaction is an assignment of levels from Σ to t of the k

factors. It,k,v denotes the set of all kt v t interactions for given t, k and v. An N × k array A covers the
1

interaction ι = {(ci , ai ) : 1 ≤ i ≤ t, ci ∈ [k], ci 6= cj for i 6= j, and ai ∈ Σ} if there is a row r in A such that
A(r, ci ) = ai for 1 ≤ i ≤ t. When there is no such row in A, ι is not covered in A. Hence a CA(N ; t, k, v)
covers all interactions in It,k,v .
Covering arrays are used extensively for interaction testing in complex engineered systems. To ensure
that all possible combinations of options of t components function together correctly, one needs examine
all possible t-way interactions. When the number of components is k, and the number of different options
available for each component is v, each row of CA(N ; t, k, v) represents a test case. The N test cases
collectively test all t-way interactions. For this reason, covering arrays have been used in combinatorial
interaction testing in varied fields like software and hardware engineering, design of composite materials,
and biological networks [8, 24, 26, 32, 34].
The cost of testing is directly related to the number of test cases. Therefore, one is interested in covering
arrays with the fewest rows. The smallest value of N for which CA(N ; t, k, v) exists is denoted by CAN(t, k, v).
Efforts to determine or bound CAN(t, k, v) have been extensive; see [12, 14, 24, 31] for example. Naturally one
would prefer to determine CAN(t, k, v) exactly. Katona [22] and Kleitman and Spencer [23] independently
showed that
 for t = v = 2, the minimum number of rows N in a CA(N ; 2, k, 2) is the smallest N for which

some progress has been made in determining upper bounds for CAN(t, k, v) in the general case; for recent
results, see [33].
For practical applications such bounds are often unhelpful, because one needs explicit covering arrays to
use as test suites. Explicit constructions can be recursive, producing larger covering arrays using smaller ones
as ingredients (see [14] for a survey), or direct. Direct methods for some specific cases arise from algebraic,
geometric, or number-theoretic techniques; general direct methods are computational in nature. Indeed
when k is relatively small, the best known results arise from computational techniques [13], and these are
in turn essential for the successes of recursive methods. Unfortunately, the existing computational methods
encounter difficulties as k increases, but is still within the range needed for practical applications. Typically
such difficulties arise either as a result of storage or time limitations or by producing covering arrays that
are too big to compete with those arising from simpler recursive methods.
Cohen [11] discusses commercial software where the number of factors often exceeds 50. Aldaco et al. [1]
analyze a complex engineered system having 75 factors, using a variant of covering arrays. Android [3] uses
a Configuration class to describe the device configuration; there are 17 different configuration parameters
with 3 − 20 different levels. In each of these cases, while existing techniques are effective when the strength
is small, these moderately large values of k pose concerns for larger strengths.
In this paper, we focus on situations in which every factor has the same number of levels. These cases
have been most extensively studied, and hence provide a basis for making comparisons. In practice, however,
often different components have different number of levels, which is captured by extending the notion of a
covering array. A mixed covering array MCA(N ; t, k, (v1 , v2 , . . . , vk )) is an N × k array in which the ith
column contains vi symbols for 1 ≤ i ≤ k. When {i1 , . . . , it } ⊆ {1, . . . , k} is
Qat set of t columns, in the N × t
subarray obtained by selecting columns i1 , . . . , it of the MCA, each of the j=1 vij distinct t-tuples appears
as a row at least once. Although we examine the uniform case in which v1 = · · · = vk , the methods developed
here can all be directly applied to mixed covering arrays as well.
Inevitably, when k > max(t + 1, v + 2), a covering array must cover some interactions more than once,
for if not they are orthogonal arrays [20]. Treating the rows of a covering array in a fixed order, each row
covers some number of interactions not covered by any earlier row. For a variety of known constructions,
the initial rows cover many new interactions, while the later ones cover very few [7]. Comparing this rate
of coverage for a purely random method and for one of the sophisticated search techniques, one finds little
difference in the initial rows, but very substantial differences in the final ones. This suggests strategies to
build the covering array in stages, investing more effort as the number of remaining uncovered interactions
declines.
In this paper we propose a new algorithmic framework for covering array construction, the two-stage
framework. In the first stage, a randomized row construction method builds a specified number of rows to
cover all but at most a specified, small number of interactions. As we see later, by dint of being randomized

2

this uses very little memory. The second stage is a more sophisticated search that adds few rows to cover the
remaining uncovered interactions. We choose search algorithms whose requirements depend on the number
of interactions to be covered, to profit from the fact that few interactions remain. By mixing randomized and
deterministic methods, we hope to retain the fast execution and small storage of the randomized methods,
along with the accuracy of the deterministic search techniques.
We introduce a number of algorithms within the two-stage framework. Some improve upon best known
bounds on CAN(t, k, v) (see [33]) in principle. But our focus is on the practical consequences: The twostage algorithms are indeed quite efficient for higher strength (t ∈ {5, 6}) and moderate number of levels
(v ∈ {3, 4, 5, 6}), when the number of factors k is moderately high (approximately in the range of 20 − 80
depending on value of t and v). In fact, for many combination of t, k and v values the two-stage algorithms
beat the previously best known bounds.
Torres-Jimenez et al. [36] explore a related two-stage strategy. In their first stage, an in-parameter-order
greedy strategy (as used in ACTS [24]) adds a column to an existing array; in their second stage, simulated
annealing is applied to cover the remaining interactions. They apply their methods when t = v = 3, when
the storage and time requirements for both stages remain acceptable. In addition to the issues in handling
larger strengths, their methods provide no a priori bound on the size of the resulting array. In contrast with
their methods, ours provide a guarantee prior to execution with much more modest storage and time.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 reviews algorithmic methods of covering array
construction, specifically the randomized algorithm and the density algorithm. This section contrasts these
two methods and points out their limitations. Then it gives an intuitive answer to the question of why a two
stage based strategy might work and introduces the general two-stage framework. Section 3 introduces some
specific two-stage algorithms. Section 3.1 analyzes and evaluates the naı̈ve strategy. Section 3.2 describes a
two-stage algorithm that combines the randomized and the density algorithm. Section 3.3 introduces graph
coloring based techniques in the second stage. Section 3.4 examines the effect of group action on the size
of the constructed covering arrays. Section 4 compares the results of various two-stage algorithms with the
presently best known sizes. In Section 5 we discuss the Lovász local lemma (LLL) bounds on CAN(t, k, v)
and provide a Moser-Tardos type randomized algorithm for covering array construction that matches the
bound. Although the bound was known [18], the proof was non-constructive, and a constructive algorithm to
match this bound seems to be absent in the literature. We explore potentially better randomized algorithms
for the first stage using LLL based techniques, We also obtain a two-stage bound that improves the LLL
bound for CAN(t, k, v). We conclude the paper in Section 6.

Algorithmic construction of covering arrays

Available algorithms for the construction of covering arrays are primarily heuristic in nature; indeed exact
algorithms have succeeded for very few cases. Computationally intensive metaheuristic search methods such
as simulated annealing, tabu search, constraint programming, and genetic algorithms have been employed
when the strength is relatively small or the number of factors and levels is small. These methods have
established many of the best known bounds on sizes of covering arrays [13], but for many problems of
practical size their time and storage requirements are prohibitive. For larger problems, the best available
methods are greedy. The IPO family of algorithms [24] repeatedly adds one column at a time, and
 then adds
new rows to ensure complete coverage. In this way, at any point in time, the status of v t k−1
t−1 interactions
may be stored. AETG [10] pioneered a different method, which greedily selects one row at a time to cover
a large number of as-yet-uncovered interactions. They establish that if a row can be chosen that covers the
maximum number, a good a priori bound on the size of the covering array can be computed. Unfortunately
selecting the maximum is NP-hard, and even if one selects the maximum there is no guarantee that the
covering array is the smallest possible
 [7], so AETG resorts to a good heuristic selection of the next row by
examining the stored status of v t kt interactions. None of the methods so far mentioned therefore guarantee
to reach an a priori bound. An
 extension of the AETG strategy, the density algorithm [5, 6, 15], stores
additional statistics for all v t kt interactions in order to ensure the selection of a good next row, and hence
guarantees to produce an array with at most the precomputed number of rows. Variants of the density

algorithm have proved to be most effective for problems of moderately large size. For even larger problems,
pure random approaches have been applied.
To produce methods that provide a guarantee on size, it is natural to focus on the density algorithm
in order to understand its strengths and weaknesses. To do this, we contrast it with a basic randomized
algorithm. Algorithm 1 shows a simple randomized algorithm for covering array construction. The algorithm
constructs an array of a particular size randomly and checks whether all the interactions are covered. It
repeats until it finds an array that covers all the interactions.

In fact, the probability that the N × k array constructed in line 3 of Algorithm 1 is a valid covering array
is high enough that the expected number of times the loop in line 2 is repeated is a small constant.
An alternative strategy is to add rows one by one instead of constructing the full array at the outset. We
start with an empty array, and whenever we add a new row we ensure that it covers at least the expected
number of previously uncovered interactions for a randomly chosen row. The probability that an uncovered
interaction is covered by a random row is 1/v t . If the number of uncovered interactions is u, then by linearity
of expectation, the expected number of newly covered interactions in a randomly chosen row is uv −t . If each
row added covers exactly this expected number, we obtain the same number of rows as the SLJ bound,
realized in Algorithm 1. But because the actual number of newly covered interactions is always an integer,
each added row covers at least duv −t e interactions. This is especially helpful towards the end when the
expected number is a small fraction.
Algorithm 2 follows this strategy. Again the probability that a randomly chosen row covers at least the
expected number of previously uncovered interactions is high enough that the expected number of times the
row selection loop in line 6 of Algorithm 2 is repeated is bounded by a small constant.
We can obtain an upper bound on the size produced by Algorithm 2 by assuming that each new row
added covers exactly duv −t e previously uncovered interactions. This bound is the discrete Stein-Lovász4

Johnson (discrete SLJ) bound. Figure 1 compares the sizes of covering arrays obtained from the SLJ and
the discrete SLJ bounds for different values of k when t = 6 and v = 3. Consider a concrete example, when
t = 5, k = 20, and v = 3. The SLJ bound guarantees the existence of a covering array with 12499 rows,
whereas the discrete SLJ bound guarantees the existence of a covering array with only 8117 rows.
The density algorithm replaces the loop at line 6 of Algorithm 2 by a conditional expectation derandomized method. For fixed v and t the density algorithm selects a row efficiently (time polynomial in k) and
deterministically that is guaranteed to cover at least duv −t e previously uncovered interactions. In practice,
for small values of k the density algorithm works quite well, often covering many more interactions than
the minimum. Many of the currently best known CAN(t, k, v) upper bounds are obtained by the density
algorithm in combination with various post-optimization techniques [13].
However, the practical applicability of Algorithm 2 and the density algorithm is limited by the storage
of the table T , representing each of the kt v t interactions. Even when t = 6, v = 3, and k = 54, there are
18,828,003,285 6-way interactions. This huge memory requirement renders the density algorithm impractical
for rather small values of k when t ∈ {5, 6} and v ≥ 3. We present an idea to circumvent this large
requirement for memory, and develop it in full in Section 3.

2.1

Why does a two stage based strategy make sense?

Compare the two extremes, the density algorithm and Algorithm 1. On one hand, Algorithm 1 does not suffer
from any substantial storage restriction, but appears to generate many more rows than the density algorithm.
On the other hand, the density algorithm constructs fewer rows for small values of k, but becomes impractical
when k is moderately large. One wants algorithms that behave like Algorithm 1 in terms of memory, but
yield a number of rows competitive with the density algorithm.
For t = 6, k = 16, and v = 3, Figure 2 compares the coverage profile for the density algorithm and
Algorithm 1. We plot the number of newly covered interactions for each row in the density algorithm, and
the expected number of newly covered interactions for each row for Algorithm 1. The qualitative features
exhibited by this plot are representative of the rates of coverage for other parameters.
Two key observations are suggested by Figure 2. First, the expected coverage in the initial random rows
is similar to the rows chosen by the density algorithm. In this example, the partial arrays consisting of the
first 1000 rows exhibit similar coverage, yet the randomized algorithm needed no extensive bookkeeping.
Secondly, as later rows are added, the judicious selections of the density algorithm produce much larger
coverage per row than Algorithm 1. Consequently it appears sensible to invest few computational resources

A specific covering array construction algorithm results by specifying the randomized method in the first
stage, the deterministic method in the second stage, and the computation of n and ρ. Any such algorithm
produces a covering array, but we wish to make selections so that the resulting algorithms are practical while
still providing a guarantee on the size of the array. In Section 3 we describe different algorithms from the
two-stage family, determine the size of the partial array to be constructed in the first stage, and establish
upper bound guarantees. In Section 4 we explore how good the algorithms are in practice.

Two-stage framework

For the first stage we consider two methods:
Rand
MT

the basic randomized algorithm
the Moser-Tardos type algorithm

We defer the development of method MT until Section 5. Method Rand uses a simple variant of Algorithm
1, choosing a random n × k array.
For the second stage we consider four methods:
Naive
Greedy
Den
Col

the

naı̈ve strategy, one row per uncovered interaction
online greedy coloring strategy
density algorithm
graph coloring algorithm

Using these abbreviations, we adopt a uniform naming convention for the algorithms: TS hA, Bi is the algorithm in which A is used in the first stage, and B is used in the second stage. For example, TS hMT, Greedyi
denotes a two-stage algorithm where the first stage is a Moser-Tardos type randomized algorithm and the
second stage is a greedy coloring algorithm. Later when the need arises we refine these algorithm names.

3.1

One row per uncovered interaction in the second stage (TS hRand, Naivei)

In the second stage each of the uncovered interactions after the first stage is covered using a new row.
Algorithm 4 describes the method in more detail.
This simple strategy improves on the basic randomized strategy when n is chosen judiciously. For
example, when t = 6, k = 54 and v = 3, Algorithm 1 constructs a covering array with 17, 236 rows. Figure
3 plots an upper bound on the size of the covering array against the number n of rows in the partial array.

The smallest covering array is obtained when n = 12, 402 which, when completed, yields a covering array
with at most 13, 162 rows—a big improvement over Algorithm 1.

when k = 100 only 2% more rows than the discrete SLJ bound.

more rows than the discrete SLJ bound, that is, 2-6% more rows.
To ensure that the loop in line 7 of Algorithm 4 does not repeat too many times we need to know the
probability with which a random n × k array leaves at most ρ interactions uncovered. Using Chebyshev’s
inequality and the second moment method developed in [2, Chapter 4], we next show that in a random n ×
nk
array the number of uncovered interactions is almost always close to its expectation, i.e. kt v t 1 − v1t .
Substituting the value of n from line 1, this expected value is equal to µ, as in line 2. Therefore, the probability
that a random n × k array covers the desired number of interactions is constant, and the expected number
of times the loop in line 7 is repeated is also a constant (around 2 in practice).

10

Because the theory of the second moment method is developed
considerable detail in [2], here we briefly
Pin
m
mention the relevant concepts and results. Suppose that X = i=1 Xi , where Xi is the indicator random
variable for event Ai for 1 ≤ i ≤ m. For indices i, j, we write i ∼ j if i 6= j and the events Ai , Aj are not
independent. Also suppose that X1 , . . . , Xm are symmetric, i.e. for every i 6= j there is a measure
preserving
P
mapping of the underlying probability space that sends event Ai to event Aj . Define ∆∗ = j∼i Pr [Aj |Ai ].
Then by [2, Corollary 4.3.4]:
Lemma 3. [2] If E[X] → ∞ and ∆∗ = o(E[X]) then X ∼ E[X] almost always.
In our case, Ai denotes the event that the ith interaction is not covered in a n × k array where each entry
n
is chosen independently and uniformly at random from a v-ary alphabet. Then Pr[Xi ] = 1 − v1t . Because

there are kt v t interactions in total, by linearity of expectation, E[X] = kt v t 1 − v1t , and E[X] → ∞ as

= o(E[X]) when v and t are constants. By Lemma 3, the number of uncovered interactions in a random
n × k array is close to the expected number of uncovered interactions. This guarantees that Algorithm 4 is
an efficient randomized algorithm for constructing covering arrays with a number of rows upper bounded by
Theorem 2.
In keeping with the general two-stage framework, Algorithm 4 does not store the coverage status of
each interaction. We only need store the interactions that are uncovered in A, of which there are at most

 ≈ v t . This quantity depends only on v and t and is independent of k, so is effectively a

constant that is much smaller than kt v t , the storage requirement for the density algorithm. Hence the
algorithm can be applied to a higher range of k values.
Although Theorem 5 provides asymptotically tighter bounds than Theorem 2, in a range of k values that
are relevant for practical application, Theorem 2 provides better results. Figure 5 compares the bounds on
CAN(t, k, v) with the currently best known results.

The density algorithm in the second stage (TS hRand, Deni)

Next we apply the density algorithm in the second stage. Figure 6 plots an upper bound on the size of the
covering array against the size of the partial array constructed in the first stage when the density algorithm
is used in the second stage, and compares it with TS hRand, Naivei. The size of the covering array decreases
11

as n decreases. This is expected because with smaller partial arrays, more interactions remain for the second
stage to be covered by the density algorithm. In fact if we cover all the interactions using the density
algorithm (as when n = 0) we would get an even smaller covering array. However, our motivation was
precisely to avoid doing that. Therefore, we need a ”cut-off” for the first stage.

Figure 6: Comparison of covering array sizes from two-stage algorithms with Den and Naive in the second
stage. With Den there is no minimum point in the curve; the size of the covering array keeps decreasing as
we leave more uncovered interactions for the second stage.
We are presented with a trade-off. If we construct a smaller partial array in the first stage, we obtain a
smaller covering array overall. But we then pay for more storage and computation time for the second stage.
To appreciate the nature of this trade-off, look at Figure 7, which plots an upper bound on the covering
array size and the number of uncovered interactions in the first stage against n. The improvement in the
covering array size plateaus after a certain point. The three horizontal lines indicate ρ (≈ v t ), 2ρ and 3ρ
uncovered interactions in the first stage. (In the naı̈ve method of Section 3.1, the partial array after the first
stage leaves at most ρ uncovered interactions.) In Figure 7 the final covering array size appears to plateau
when the number of uncovered interactions left by the first stage is around 2ρ. After that we see diminishing
returns — the density algorithm needs to cover more interactions in return for a smaller improvement in the
covering array size.
Let r be the maximum number of interactions allowed to remain uncovered after the first stage. Then r
can be specified in the two-stage algorithm. To accommodate this, we denote by TS hA, B; ri the two-stage
algorithm where A is the first stage strategy, B is the second stage strategy, and r is the maximum number
of uncovered interactions after the first stage. For example, TS hRand, Den; 2ρi applies the basic randomized
algorithm in the first stage to cover all but at most 2ρ interactions, and the density algorithm to cover the
remaining interactions in the second stage.

Coloring in the second stage (TS hRand, Coli and TS hRand, Greedyi)

Now we describe strategies using graph coloring in the second stage. Construct a graph G = (V, E), the
incompatibility graph, in which V is the set of uncovered interactions, and there is an edge between two

interactions exactly when they share a column in which they have different symbols. A single row can cover
a set of interactions if and only if it forms an independent set in G. Hence the minimum number of rows
required to cover all interactions of G is exactly its chromatic number χ(G), the minimum number of colors
in a proper coloring of G. Graph coloring is an NP-hard problem, so we employ heuristics to bound the
chromatic number. Moreover, G only has vertices for the uncovered interactions after the first stage, so is
size is small relative to the total number of interactions.

the chromatic number χ ≤ 12 + 2m + 14 , where m is the number of edges [16, Chapter 5.2], we can surely
q
cover the remaining interactions with at most 12 + 2m + 14 rows.
The actual number of edges m that remain after the first stage is a random variable with mean γ. In
principle, the first stage could be repeatedly applied until m ≤ γ, so we call m = γ the optimistic estimate.
To ensure that the first stage is expected to be run a small constant number of times, we increase the
estimate. With probability more than 1/2 the incompatibility graph has m ≤ 2γ edges, so m = 2γ is the
conservative estimate.
For t = 6, k = 56, and v = 3, Figure 8 shows the effect on the minimum number of rows when the bound
on the chromatic number in the second stage is used, for the conservative or optimistic estimates. The Naı̈ve
method is plotted for comparison. Better coloring bounds shift the minima leftward, reducing the number
of rows produced in both stages.
Thus far we have considered bounds on the chromatic number. Better estimation of χ(G) is complicated
by the fact that we do not have much information about the structure of G until the first stage is run. In
practice, however, G is known after the first stage and hence an algorithmic method to bound its chromatic
number can be applied. Because the number of vertices in G equals the number of uncovered interactions

after the first stage, we encounter the same trade-off between time and storage, and final array size, as seen
earlier for density. Hence we again parametrize by the expected number of uncovered interactions in the
first stage.
We employ two different greedy algorithms to color the incompatibility graph. In method Col we first
construct the incompatibility graph G after the first stage. Then we apply the commonly used smallest last
order heuristic to order the vertices for greedy coloring: At each stage, find a vertex vi of minimum degree
in Gi , order the vertices of Gi − vi , and then place vi at the end. More precisely, we order the vertices of G
as v1 , v2 , . . . , vn , such that vi is a vertex of minimum degree in Gi , where Gi = G − {vi+1 , . . . , vn }. A graph
is d-degenerate if all of its subgraphs have a vertex with degree at most d. When G is d-degenerate but not
(d − 1)-degenerate, the Coloring number col(G) is d + 1. If we then greedily color the vertices with the first
available color, at most col(G) colors are used.
In method Greedy we employ an on-line, greedy approach that colors the interactions as they are discovered in the first stage. In this way, the incompatibility graph is never constructed. We instead maintain a set
of rows. Some entries in rows are fixed to a specific value; others are flexible to take on any value. Whenever
a new interaction is found to be uncovered in the first stage, we check if any of the rows is compatible with
this interaction. If such a row is found then entries in the row are fixed so that the row now covers the
interaction. If no such row exists, a new row with exactly t fixed entries corresponding to the interaction is
added to the set of rows. This method is much faster than method Col in practice.

3.4

Using group action

Covering arrays that are invariant under the action of a permutation group on their symbols can be easier
to construct and are often smaller [15]. Direct and computational constructions using group actions are
explored in [9, 28]. Sarkar et al. [33] establish the asymptotically tightest known bounds on CAN(t, k, v)
using group actions. In this section we explore the implications of group actions on two-stage algorithms.
Let Γ be a permutation group on the set of symbols. The action of this group partitions the set of
t-way interactions into orbits. We construct an array A such that for every orbit, at least one row covers
an interaction from that orbit. Then we develop the rows of A over Γ to obtain a covering array that is
invariant under the action of Γ. Effort then focuses on covering all the orbits of t-way interactions, instead
of the individual interactions.
If Γ acts sharply transitively
on the set of symbols

 (for example, if Γ is a cyclic group of order v) then
the action of Γ partitions kt v t interactions into kt v t−1 orbits of length v each. Following

Similarly, we can employ a Frobenius group. When v is a prime power, the Frobenius group is the group
of permutations of Fv of the form {x 7→ ax + b : a, b ∈ Fv , a 6= 0}. The action of the Frobenius group
t−1
partitions the set of t-tuples on v symbols into v v−1−1 orbits of length v(v − 1) (full orbits) each and 1 orbit
of length v (a short orbit). The short orbit consists of tuples of the form (x1 , . . . , xt ) where x1 = . . . = xt .
Therefore, we can obtain a covering array by first constructing an array that covers all the full orbits, and
then developing all the rows over the Frobenius group and adding v constant rows. Using the two stage
strategy in conjunction with the Frobenius group action we obtain:

t = 6, v = 3 and 50 ≤ k ≤ 75. Group action reduces the required number of rows slightly.
Figure 9 compares the simple two-stage bound with the cyclic and Frobenius two-stage bounds. For
t = 6, v = 3 and 12 ≤ k ≤ 100, the cyclic bound requires 7-21 (on average 16) fewer rows than the simple
bound. In the same range the Frobenius bound requires 17 − 51 (on average 40) fewer rows.
Group action can be applied in other methods for the second stage as well. Colbourn [15] incorporates
group action into the density algorithm, allowing us to apply method Den in the second stage.
Greedy extends easily to use group action, as we do not construct an explicit incompatibility graph.
Whenever we fix entries in a row to cover an uncovered orbit, we commit to a specific orbit representative.
However, applying group action to the incompatibility graph coloring for Col is more complicated. We
need to modify the definition of the incompatibility graph for two reasons. First the vertices no longer
represent uncovered interactions, but rather uncovered orbits of interaction. Secondly, and perhaps more
importantly, pairwise compatibility between every two orbits in a set no longer implies mutual compatibility
among all orbits in the set.
One approach is to form a vertex for each uncovered orbit, placing an edge between two when they share
a column. Rather than the usual coloring, however, one asks for a partition of the vertex set into classes so
that every class induces an acyclic subgraph. Problems of this type are generalized graph coloring problems
[4]. Within each class of such a vertex partition, consistent representatives of each orbit can be selected to
form a row; when a cycle is present, this may not be possible. Unfortunately, heuristics for solving these
types of problems appear to be weak, so we adopt a second approach. As we build the incompatibility
graph, we commit to specific orbit representatives. When a vertex for an uncovered orbit is added, we check
its compatibility with the orbit representatives chosen for the orbits already handled with which it shares
columns; we commit to an orbit representative and add edges to those with which it is now incompatible.
Once completed, we have a (standard) coloring problem for the resulting graph.
Because group action can be applied using each of the methods for the two stages, we extend our naming
to TS hA, B; r, Γi, where Γ can be Trivial (i.e. no group action), Cyclic, or Frobenius.

Computational results

Figure 5 indicates that even a simple two-stage bound can improve on best known covering array numbers.
Therefore we investigate the actual performance of our two-stage algorithms for covering arrays of strength
5 and 6.
First we present results for t = 6, when v ∈ {3, 4, 5, 6} and no group action is assumed. Table 1 shows the
results for different v values. In each case we select the range of k values where the two-stage bound predicts
smaller covering arrays than
 previously known best ones, setting the maximum number of uncovered
 tthe
v
interactions as ρ = 1/ log vt −1 ≈ v t . For each value of k we construct a single partial array and then run
the different second stage algorithms on it consecutively. In this way all the second stage algorithms cover
the same set of uncovered interactions.
The column tab lists the best known CAN(t, k, v) upper bounds from [13]. The column bound shows the
upper bounds obtained from the two-stage bound (2). The columns naı̈ve, greedy, col and den show results
obtained from running the TS hRand, Naive; ρ, Triviali, TS hRand, Greedy; ρ, Triviali, TS hRand, Col; ρ, Triviali
and TS hRand, Den; ρ, Triviali algorithms, respectively.
The naı̈ve method always finds a covering array that is smaller than the two-stage bound. This happens
because we repeat the first stage of Algorithm 4 until the array has fewer than v t uncovered interactions.
(If the first stage were not repeated, the algorithm still produce covering arrays that are not too far from
the bound.) For v = 3 Greedy and Den have comparable performance. Method Col produces covering arrays
that are smaller. However, for v ∈ {4, 5, 6} Den and Col are competitive.
Table 2 shows the results obtained by the different second stage algorithms when the maximum number
of uncovered interactions in the first stage is set to 2ρ and 3ρ respectively. When more interactions are
covered in the second stage, we obtain smaller arrays as expected. However, the improvement in size does
not approach 50%. There is no clear winner.
Next we investigate the covering arrays that are invariant under the action of a cyclic group. In Table 3 the
column bound shows the upper bounds from Equation (1). The columns naı̈ve, greedy, col and den show
results obtained from running TS hRand, Naive; ρ, Cyclici, TS hRand, Greedy; ρ, Cyclici, TS hRand, Col; ρ, Cyclici
and TS hRand, Den; ρ, Cyclici, respectively.
Table 4 presents results for cyclic group action based algorithms when the number of maximum uncovered
interactions in the first stage is set to 2ρ and 3ρ respectively.
For the Frobenius group action, we show results only for v ∈ {3, 5} in Table 5. The column bound shows
the upper bounds obtained from Equation (2).
Table 6 presents results for Frobenius group action algorithms when the number of maximum uncovered
interactions in the first stage is 2ρ or 3ρ.
Next we present a handful of results when t = 5. In the cases examined, using the trivial group action
is too time consuming to be practical. However, the cyclic or Frobenius cases are feasible. Tables 7 and 8
compare two stage algorithms when the number of uncovered interactions in the first stage is at most 2ρ.
In almost all cases there is no clear winner among the three second stage methods. Methods Den and
Greedy are, however, substantially faster and use less memory than method Col; for practical purposes they
would be preferred.

Limited dependence and the Moser-Tardos algorithm

Here we explore a different randomized algorithm that produces smaller covering arrays than Algorithm 1.
When k > 2t, there are interactions that share no column. The events of coverage of such interactions are
independent. Moser et al. [29, 30] provide an efficient randomized construction method that exploits this

limited dependence. Specializing their method to covering arrays, we obtain Algorithm 5. For the specified
value of N in the algorithm it is guaranteed that the expected number of times the loop in line 3 of Algorithm
5 is repeated is linearly bounded in k (See Theorem 1.2 of [30]).
The upper bound on CAN(t, k, v) guaranteed by Algorithm 5 is obtained by applying the Lovász local
lemma (LLL).
Lemma 4. (Lovász local lemma; symmetric case) (see [2]) Let A1 , A2 , . . . , An events in an arbitrary probability space. Suppose that each event Ai is mutually independent of a set of all other events Aj except for at
most d, and that Pr[Ai ] ≤ p for all 1 ≤ i ≤ n. If ep(d + 1) ≤ 1, then Pr[∩ni=1 Āi ] > 0.
The symmetric version of Lovász local lemma provides an upper bound on the probability of a “bad”
event in terms of the maximum degree of a bad event in a dependence graph, so that the probability that
all the bad events are avoided is non zero. Godbole, Skipper, and Sunley [18] apply Lemma 4 essentially to
obtain the bound on CAN(t, k, v) in line 1 of Algorithm 5.

The bound on the size of covering arrays obtained from Theorem 5 is asymptotically tighter than the
one obtained from Theorem 1. Figure 10 compares the bounds for t = 6 and v = 3.
The original proof of LLL is essentially non-constructive and does not immediately lead to a polynomial
time construction algorithm for covering arrays satisfying the bound of Theorem 5. Indeed no previous
construction algorithms appear to be based on it. However the Moser-Tardos method of Algorithm 5 does
provide a construction algorithm running in expected polynomial time. For sufficiently large values of k
Algorithm 5 produces smaller covering arrays than the Algorithm 1.
But the question remains: Does Algorithm 5 produce smaller covering arrays than the currently best
known results within the range that it can be effectively computed? Perhaps surprisingly, we show that
the answer is affirmative. In Algorithm 5 we do not need to store the coverage information of individual
interactions in memory because each time an uncovered interaction is encountered we re-sample the columns
involved in that interaction and start the check afresh (checking the coverage in interactions in the same
order each time). Consequently, Algorithm 5 can be applied for larger values of k than the density algorithm.

Smaller covering arrays can be obtained by exploiting a group action using LLL, as shown in [33]. Table
9 shows the sizes of the covering arrays constructed by a variant of Algorithm 5 that employs cyclic and
Frobenius group actions. While this single stage algorithm produces smaller arrays than the currently best
known [13], these are already superseded by the two-stage based algorithms.

5.1

Moser-Tardos type algorithm for the first stage

The linearity of expectation arguments used in the SLJ bounds permit one to consider situations in which
a few of the “bad” events are allowed to occur, a fact that we exploited in the first stage of the algorithms
thus far. However, the Lovász local lemma does not address this situation directly. The conditional Lovász
local lemma (LLL) distribution, introduced in [19], is a very useful tool.
Lemma 6. (Conditional LLL distribution; symmetric case) (see [2, 33]) Let A = {A1 , A2 , . . . , Al } be a set
of l events in an arbitrary probability space. Suppose that each event Ai is mutually independent of a set of
all other events Aj except for at most d, and that Pr[Ai ] ≤ p for all 1 ≤ i ≤ l. Also suppose that ep(d+1) ≤ 1
(Therefore, by LLL (Lemma 4) Pr[∩li=1 Āi ] > 0). Let B ∈
/ A be another event in the same probability space

with Pr[B] ≤ q, such that B is also mutually independent of a set of all other events Aj ∈ A except for at

We apply the conditional
LLL distribution to obtain an upper bound on the size of partial array that
 t 

leaves at most log vt −1 ≈ v t interactions uncovered. For a positive integer k, let I = {j1 , . . . , jρ } ⊆ [k]
where j1 < . . . < jρ . Let A be an n × k array where each entry is from the set [v]. Let AI denote the n × ρ
array in which AI (i, `) = A(i, j` ) for 1 ≤ i ≤ N and 1 ≤ ` ≤ ρ; AI is the projection of A onto the columns
in I.

Let M ⊆ [v]t be a set of m t-tuples of symbols, and C ∈ [k]
be a set of t columns. Suppose the
t
entries in the array A are chosen independently from [v] with uniform probability.
 Let BC denote the event
that at least one of the tuples in M is not covered in AC . There are η = kt such events, and for all of
n
them Pr[BC ] ≤ m 1 − v1t . Moreover, when k ≥ 2t, each of the events is mutually independent of all

there exists an n × k array A over [v] such that for all C ∈ [k]

we can use a Moser-Tardos type algorithm to construct such an array.
Let ι be an interaction whose t-tuple
n of symbols is not in M . Then the probability that ι is not covered
in an n × k array is at most 1 − v1t
when each entry of the array is chosen independently from [v] with
uniform probability. Therefore, by the

We compare the size of the partial array from the naı̈ve two-stage method (Algorithm 4) with the size
obtained by the graphical methods in Figure 12. The Lovász local lemma based method is asymptotically
better than the simple randomized method. However, except for the small values of t and v, in the range
of k values relevant for practical applications the simple randomized algorithm requires fewer rows than the
Lovász local lemma based method.

Lovász local lemma based two-stage bound

We can apply the techniques from Section 5.1 to obtain a two-stage bound similar to Theorem 2 using the
Lovász local lemma and conditional LLL distribution. First we extend a result from [33].

Figure 13 compares the LLL based two-stage bound from Theorem 7 to the standard two-stage bound

LLL based two-stage bound is tighter than the LLL based Godbole et al. bound, even for quite large values
of k the standard two-stage bound is tighter than the LLL based two-stage bound. In practical terms, this
specific LLL based two-stage method does not look very promising, unless the parameters are quite large.

Conclusion and open problems

Many concrete algorithms within a two-stage framework for covering array construction have been introduced
and evaluated. The two-stage approach extends the range of parameters for which competitive covering arrays
can be constructed, each meeting an a priori guarantee on its size. Indeed as a consequence a number of
best known covering arrays have been improved upon. Although each of the methods proposed has useful
features, our experimental evaluation suggests that TS hRand, Greedy; 2ρ, Γi and TS hRand, Den; 2ρ.Γi with
Γ ∈ {Cyclic, Frobenius} realize a good trade-off between running time and size of the constructed covering
array.
Improvements in the bounds, or in the algorithms that realize them, are certainly of interest. We
mention some specific directions. Establishing tighter bounds on the coloring based methods of Section 3.3
is a challenging problem. Either better estimates of the chromatic number of the incompatibility graph after
a random first stage, or a first stage designed to limit the chromatic number, could lead to improvements in
the bounds.
In Section 5.1 and 5.2 we explored using a Moser-Tardos type algorithm for the first stage. Although this
is useful for asymptotic bounds, practical improvements appear to be limited. Perhaps a different approach of

reducing the number of bad events to be avoided explicitly by the algorithm may lead to a better algorithm.
A potential approach may look like following: “Bad” events would denote non-coverage of an interaction
over a t-set of columns. We would select a set of column t-sets such that the dependency graph of the
corresponding bad events have a bounded maximum degree (less than the original dependency graph). We
would devise a Moser-Tardos type algorithm for covering all the interactions on our chosen column t-sets,
and then apply the conditional LLL distribution to obtain an upper bound on the number of uncovered
interactions. However, the difficulty lies in the fact that “all vertices have degree ≤ ρ” is a non-trivial,
“hereditary” property for induced subgraphs, and for such properties finding a maximum induced subgraph
with the property is an NP-hard optimization problem [17]. There is still hope for a randomized or “nibble”
like strategy that may find a reasonably good induced subgraph with a bounded maximum degree. Further
exploration of this idea seems to be a promising research avenue.
In general, one could consider more than two stages. Establishing the benefit (or not) of having more
than two stages is also an interesting open problem. Finally, the application of the methods developed to
mixed covering arrays appears to provide useful techniques for higher strengths; this merits further study as
well.

Abstract. A covering array CA(N ; t, k, v) is an N × k array with entries in {1, 2, . . . , v}, for which every N × t subarray contains each ttuple of {1, 2, . . . , v}t among its rows. Covering arrays find application
in interaction testing, including software and hardware testing, advanced
materials development, and biological systems. A central question is to
determine or bound CAN(t, k, v), the minimum number N of rows of a
CA(N ; t, k, v). The well known bound CAN(t, k, v) = O((t − 1)v t log k)
is not too far from being asymptotically optimal. Sensible relaxations of
the covering requirement arise when (1) the set {1, 2, . . . , v}t need only
be contained among the rows of at least (1 − ) kt of the N × t subarrays
and (2) the rows of every N × t subarray need only contain a (large)
subset of {1, 2, . . . , v}t . In this paper, using probabilistic methods, significant improvements on the covering array upper bound are established
for both relaxations, and for the conjunction of the two. In each case,
a randomized algorithm constructs such arrays in expected polynomial
time.

Introduction

Let [n] denote the set {1, 2, . . . , n}. Let N, t, k, and v be integers such that
k ≥ t ≥ 2 and v ≥ 2. Let A be an N × k array where each entry is from the set
[v]. For I = {j1 , . . . , jρ } ⊆ [k] where j1 < . . . < jρ , let AI denote the N × ρ array
in which AI (i, `) = A(i, j` ) for 1 ≤ i ≤ N and 1 ≤ ` ≤ ρ; AI is the projection of
A onto the columns in I.
A covering array CA(N ; t, k, v) is an N × k array A with each entry from

t
[v] so that for each t-set of columns C ∈ [k]
t , each t-tuple x ∈ [v] appears
as a row in AC . The smallest N for which a CA(N ; t, k, v) exists is denoted by
CAN(t, k, v).
Covering arrays find important application in software and hardware testing
(see [22] and references therein). Applications of covering arrays also arise in
experimental testing for advanced materials [4], inference of interactions that
regulate gene expression [29], fault-tolerance of parallel architectures [15], synchronization of robot behavior [17], drug screening [30], and learning of boolean
functions [11]. Covering arrays have been studied using different nomenclature,
as qualitatively independent partitions [13], t-surjective arrays [5], and (k, t)universal sets [19], among others. Covering arrays are closely related to hash
families [10] and orthogonal arrays [8].

2

Background and Motivation

The exact or approximate determination of CAN(t, k, v) is central in applications
of covering arrays, but remains an open problem. For fixed t and v, only when
t = v = 2 is CAN(t, k, v) known precisely for infinitely many values of k. Kleitman
and Spencer [21] and Katona [20] independently
 proved that the largest k for
N −1
which a CA(N ; 2, k, 2) exists satisfies k = dN/2e
. When t = 2, Gargano, Kőrner,
and Vaccaro [13] establish that
CAN(2, k, v) =

v
log k(1 + o(1)).
2

(1)

(We write log for logarithms base 2, and ln for natural logarithms.) Several researchers [2,5,14,16] establish a general asymptotic upper bound on CAN(t, k, v):
CAN(t, k, v) ≤

t−1
log k(1 + o(1)).
t
log vtv−1

(2)

A slight improvement on (2) has recently been proved [12,28]. An (essentially)
equivalent but more convenient form of (2) is:
CAN(t, k, v) ≤ (t − 1)v t log k(1 + o(1)).

(3)

A lower bound on CAN(t, k, v) results from the inequality CAN(t, k, v) ≥ v ·
CAN(t − 1, k − 1, v) obtained by derivation, together with (1), to establish that
CAN(t, k, v) ≥ v t−2 · CAN(2, k − t + 2, v) = v t−2 · v2 log(k − t + 2)(1 + o(1)). When
t
k < 1, we obtain:
CAN(t, k, v) = Ω(v t−1 log k).
(4)
Because (4) ensures that the number of rows in covering arrays can be considerable, researchers have suggested the need for relaxations in which not all
interactions must be covered [7,18,23,24] in order to reduce the number of rows.
The practical relevance is that each row corresponds to a test to be performed,
adding to the cost of testing.
For example, an array covers a t-set of columns when it covers each of the
v t interactions on this t-set. Hartman and Raskin [18] consider arrays with a
fixed number of rows that cover the maximum number of t-sets of columns. A
similar question was also considered in [24]. In [23,24] a more refined measure of
the (partial) coverage of an N × k array A is introduced. For a given q ∈ [0, 1],
let α(A, q) be the number of N × t submatrices of A with the property that at
least qv t elements
of [v]t appear in their set of rows; the (q, t)-completeness of A

k
is α(A, q)/ t . Then for practical purposes one wants “high” (q, t)-completeness
with few rows.
In these works, no theoretical results on partial coverage appear to have been
stated; earlier contributions focus on experimental investigations of heuristic
construction methods. Our purpose is to initiate a mathematical investigation
of arrays offering “partial” coverage. More precisely, we address:

– Can one obtain a significant improvement on the upper bound (3) if the set
[v]t is only required to be contained among the rows of at least (1 − ) kt
subarrays of A of dimension N × t?
– Can one obtain a significant improvement if, among the rows of every N × t
subarray of A, only a (large) subset of [v]t is required to be contained?
– Can one obtain a significant improvement if the set [v]t is only required to be
contained among the rows of at least (1 − ) kt subarrays of A of dimension

N × t, and among the rows of each of the  kt subarrays that remain, a
(large) subset of [v]t is required to be contained?
We answer these questions both theoretically and algorithmically in the following
sections.

Partial Covering Arrays

When 1 ≤ m ≤ v t , a partial m-covering array, PCA(N ; t, k, v, m), is an N × k

array A with each entry from [v] so that for each t-set of columns C ∈ [k]
t , at
least m distinct tuples x ∈ [v]t appear as rows in AC . Hence a covering array
CA(N ; t, k, v) is precisely a partial v t -covering array PCA(N ; t, k, v, v t ).
Theorem 1. For integers t, k, v, and m where k ≥ t ≥ 2, v ≥ 2 and 1 ≤ m ≤ v t
there exists a PCA(N ; t, k, v, m) with
n  t o
v


(5)
N≤

.
Proof. Let r = v t −m+1, and A be a random N ×k array where each
 entry is chosen independently from [v] with uniform probability. For C ∈ [k]
t , let BC denote
the event that at least r tuples from [v]t are missing in AC . The probability that
N
a particular r-set of tuples from [v]t is missing in AC is 1 − vrt . Applying the
N
t
union bound to all r-sets of tuples from [v]t , we obtain Pr[BC ] ≤ vr 1 − vrt .
By linearity of expectation, the expected number of t-sets C for which AC misses

N
at least r tuples from [v]t is at most kt vr 1 − vrt . When A has at least


exists with the required number of rows such that for all C ∈ [k]
t , AC misses
at most r − 1 tuples from [v]t , i.e. AC covers at least m tuples from [v]t .

Theorem 1 can be improved upon using the Lovász local lemma.
Lemma 1. (Lovász local lemma; symmetric case) (see [1]) Let A1 , A2 , . . . , An
events in an arbitrary probability space. Suppose that each event Ai is mutually
independent of a set of all other events Aj except for at most d, and that Pr[Ai ] ≤
p for all 1 ≤ i ≤ n. If ep(d + 1) ≤ 1, then Pr[∩ni=1 Āi ] > 0.

Lemma 1 provides an upper bound on the probability of a “bad” event in terms
of the dependence structure among such bad events, so that there is a guaranteed
outcome in which all “bad” events are avoided. This lemma is most useful when
there is limited dependence among the “bad” events, as in the following:

and thereby recover the upper bound (3). Theorem 2 implies:
Corollary 1. Given q ∈ [0, 1] and integers 2 ≤ t ≤ k, v ≥ 2, there exists an
N × k array on [v] with (q, t)-completeness equal to 1 (i.e., maximal), whose

Hence when r = v(t − 1) (or equivalently, m = v t − v(t − 1) + 1), there is a
partial m-covering array with Θ(v t−1 ln k) rows. This matches the lower bound
(4) asymptotically for covering arrays by missing, in each t-set of columns, no
more than v(t − 1) − 1 of the v t possible rows.
The dependence of the bound (6) on the number of v-ary t-vectors that must
appear in the t-tuples of columns is particularly of interest when test suites are
run sequentially until a fault is revealed, as in [3]. Indeed the arguments here
may have useful consequences for the rate of fault detection.

Lemma 1 and hence Theorem 2 have proofs that are non-constructive in
nature. Nevertheless, Moser and Tardos [26] provide a randomized algorithm
with the same guarantee. Patterned on their method, Algorithm 1 constructs a
partial m-covering array with exactly the same number of rows as (6) in expected
polynomial time. Indeed, for fixed t, the expected number of times the resampling

Almost Partial Covering Arrays

For 0 <  < 1, an -almost partial m-covering array, APCA(N ; t, k, v, m, ), is an
N × k array A with each entry from [v] so that for at least (1 − ) kt column


array CA(N ; t, k, v) is precisely an APCA(N ; t, k, v, v t , ) when  < 1/ kt . Our
first result on -almost partial m-covering arrays is the following.
Theorem 3. For integers t, k, v, m and real  where k ≥ t ≥ 2, v ≥ 2, 1 ≤ m ≤
v t and 0 ≤  ≤ 1, there exists an APCA(N ; t, k, v, m, ) with

When m = v t , an -almost covering array exists with N ≤ v t ln v rows.
Improvements result by focussing on covering arrays in which the symbols are
acted on by a finite group. In this setting, one chooses orbit representatives of
rows that collectively cover orbit representatives of t-way interactions under the
group action; see [9], for example. Such group actions have been used in direct
and computational methods for covering arrays [6,25], and in randomized and
derandomized methods [9,27,28].
We employ the sharply transitive action of the cyclic group of order v, adapting the earlier arguments using methods from [28]:
Theorem 4. For integers t, k, v and real  where k ≥ t ≥ 2, v ≥ 2 and 0 ≤  ≤ 1
there exists an APCA(N ; t, k, v, v t , ) with

Proof. The action of the cyclic group of order v partitions [v]t into v t−1 orbits, each of length v. Let n = b Nv c and let A be an n × k random array
where each entry is chosen independently from the set [v] with uniform prob
ability. For C ∈ [k]
t , AC covers the orbit X if at least one tuple x ∈ X
is present
n in AC . The
nprobability that the orbit X is not covered in A is
1
1 − vvt

at least one orbit. Applying the union bound, Pr[DC ] ≤ v t−1 1 − vt−1

at most  kt and solve for n. An array exists that covers all orbits in at least

(1 − ) kt column t-sets. Develop this array over the cyclic group to obtain the
desired array.

As in [28], further improvements result by considering a group, like the
Frobenius group, that acts sharply 2-transitively on [v]. When v is a prime
power, the Frobenius group is the group of permutations of Fv of the form
{x 7→ ax + b : a, b ∈ Fv , a 6= 0}.
Theorem 5. For integers t, k, v and real  where k ≥ t ≥ 2, v ≥ 2, v is a prime
power and 0 ≤  ≤ 1 there exists an APCA(N ; t, k, v, v t , ) with

Proof. The action of the Frobenius group partitions [v]t into v v−1−1 orbits of
length v(v − 1) (full orbits) each and 1 orbit of length v (a short orbit). The
short orbit consists of tuples of the form (x1 , . . . , xt ) ∈ [v]t where x1 = . . . = xt .
N −v
Let n = b v(v−1)
c and let A be an n × k random array where each entry is
chosen independently from the set [v] with uniform probability. Our strategy is
to construct A so that it covers all full orbits for the required number of arrays
{AC : C ∈ [k]
t }. Develop A over the Frobenius group and add v rows of the
form (x1 , . . . , xk ) ∈ [v]t with x1 = . . . = xk to obtain an APCA(N ; t, k, v, v t , )
with the desired value of N . Following the lines of the proof of Theorem 4, A
covers all full orbits in at least (1 − ) kt column t-sets C when

Using group action when m = v t affords useful improvements. Does this
improvement extend to cases when m < v t ? Unfortunately, the answer appears
to be no. Consider the case for PCA(N ; t, k, v, m) when m ≤ v t using the action
of the cyclic group of order v on [v]t . Let A be a random n × k array over [v].
When v t − vs + 1 ≤ m ≤ v t − v(s − 1) for 1 ≤ s ≤ v t−1 , this implies that

consistently outperforms (12) for all values of k when t = 6, v = 4. We observe

from above the number of missing tuples to a certain small function f (t) of t, it
 t−1
is sufficient that  ≤ v t−1 k1 f (t)+1 . Then the number of missing t-tuples x ∈ [v]t

Once again we obtain a size that is O(v t−1 log k), a goal that has not been
reached for covering arrays. This is evidence that even a small relaxation of
covering arrays provides arrays of the best sizes one can hope for.
Next we consider the efficient construction of the arrays whose existence is
ensured by Theorem 6. Algorithm 2 is a randomized method to construct an
APCA(N ; t, k, v, m, ) of a size N that is very close to the bound of Theorem
3. By Markov’s inequality the condition in line 9 of Algorithm 2 is met with
probability at most 1/2. Therefore, the expected number of times the loop in
line 2 repeats is at most 2.
To prove Theorem 3, t-wise independence among the variables is sufficient.
Hence, Algorithm 2 can be derandomized using t-wise independent random variables. We can also derandomize the algorithm using the method of conditional
expectation. In this method we construct A by considering the k columns one by
one and fixing all N entries of a column. Given a set of already fixed columns,
to fix the entries of the next column we consider all possible v N choices, and
choose one that provides
 the maximum conditional expectation of the tnumber of
column t-sets C ∈ [k]
such that AC covers at least m tuples x ∈ [v] . Because
t
v N = O(poly(1/)), this derandomized algorithm constructs the desired array
in polynomial time. Similar randomized and derandomized strategies can be applied to construct the array guaranteed by Theorem 4. Together with Algorithm
1 this implies that the array in Theorem 6 is also efficiently constructible.

Final Remarks

We have shown that by relaxing the coverage requirement of a covering array somewhat, powerful upper bounds on the sizes of the arrays can be established. Indeed the upper bounds are substantially smaller than the best known
bounds for a covering array; they are of the same order as the lower bound for
CAN(t, k, v). As importantly, the techniques not only provide asymptotic bounds
but also randomized polynomial time construction algorithms for such arrays.
Our approach seems flexible enough to handle variations of these problems.
For instance, some applications require arrays that satisfy, for different subsets
of columns, different coverage or separation requirements [8]. In [16] several
interesting examples of combinatorial problems are presented that can be unified
and expressed in the framework of S-constrained matrices. Given a set of vectors

S each of length t, an N ×k matrix M is S-constrained if for every t-set C ∈ [k]
t ,
MC contains as a row each of the vectors in S. The parameter to optimize is,
as usual, the number of rows of M . One potential direction is to ask for arrays
that, in every t-tuple of columns, cover at least m of the vectors in S, or that
all vectors in S are covered by all but a small number of t-tuples of columns.
Exploiting the structure of the members of S appears to require an extension of
the results developed here.

A Combinatorial Approach to X-Tolerant
Compaction Circuits

arXiv:1508.00481v1 [cs.IT] 3 Aug 2015

Yuichiro Fujiwara and Charles J. Colbourn

Abstract—Test response compaction for integrated circuits
(ICs) with scan-based design-for-testability (DFT) support in
the presence of unknown logic values (Xs) is investigated from
a combinatorial viewpoint. The theoretical foundations of Xcodes, employed in an X-tolerant compaction technique called
X-compact, are examined. Through the formulation of a combinatorial model of X-compact, novel design techniques are developed
for X-codes to detect a specified maximum number of errors in
the presence of a specified maximum number of unknown logic
values, while requiring only small fan-out. The special class of
X-codes that results leads to an avoidance problem for configurations in combinatorial designs. General design methods and
nonconstructive existence theorems to estimate the compaction
ratio of an optimal X-compactor are also derived.

HIS work discusses a class of codes that arise in data
volume compaction of responses from integrated circuits (ICs) under scan-based test. We first recall briefly the
background of the X-tolerant compaction technique in digital
circuit testing.
Digital circuit testing applies test patterns to a circuit under
test and monitors the circuit’s responses to the applied patterns.
A tester compares the observed response to a test pattern to
the expected response and, if there is a mismatch, declares
the circuit chip defective. Usually the expected responses are
obtained through fault-free simulation of the chip.
Test cost for traditional scan-based testing is dominated
by test data volume and test time [1]. Therefore various test
compression techniques have been developed to reduce test
cost. One way to achieve this is to reduce test application time
and the number of test patterns by employing automatic test
pattern generation (ATPG) (see [2]–[5] and references therein).
We are interested in the other kind of technique, using methods
to hash responses while maintaining test quality. Signature
analyzers (e.g., [6]–[10]) are vulnerable to error masking
caused by unknown logic values (Xs) [11]. X-compact has
been proposed in order to conduct reliable testing in the
presence of Xs [12]. A response compaction circuit based

on X-compact is an X-compactor. X-compactors have proved
their high error detection ability in actual systems [11], [13].
An X-compactor can be written in matrix form as an X-code
[14]. Basic properties of X-codes have been studied [14], [15].
Graph theoretic techniques have been employed to minimize
fan-out of inputs [16]; in general an X-compactor tolerates the
presence of Xs in exchange for large fan-out. These studies
focus on particular classes of X-codes rather than the general
coding theoretic aspects.
The purpose of the present paper is to investigate theoretical
foundations of X-codes and to provide general construction
techniques. In Section II we outline the combinatorial requirements for the X-compact technique and present an equivalent
definition of X-codes in order to investigate X-compactors
as codes and combinatorial designs. Some basic properties
of X-codes are also presented. In Section III we investigate
X-codes that require only small fan-out and have good error detectability and X-tolerance. We prove the equivalence
between a class of Steiner t-designs and particular X-codes
having the maximum number of codewords and the minimum
fan-out. This allows us to give constructions and to show
existence of such X-codes. Section IV deals with existence of
X-codes in the more general situation. Both constructive and
nonconstructive theorems are provided. Finally we conclude
in Section V.

We do not describe scan-based testing and response compaction in detail here, instead referring the reader to [11], [12].
Scan-based testing repeatedly applies vectors of test inputs
to the circuit, and for each test captures a vector from {0, 1}n
as the test output. Naturally it is important that the test output
be the correct one. To determine this, the function of the circuit
is simulated (in a fault-free manner) to produce a reference
output. When the test and reference outputs agree, no fault
has been detected. The first major obstacle is that fault-free
simulation may be unable to determine whether a specific
output is 0 or 1, and hence it is an unknown logic value X.
The second is that if each output requires a separate pin on the
chip, the number of tests that can be accommodated is quite
restricted. We deal with these two problems in turn.
We define an algebraic system to describe the behavior of
Xs. The X-algebra X2 = ({0, 1, X}, +, ·) over the field F2
is the set {0, 1} of elements of F2 and a third element X,
equipped with two binary operations “+” (addition) and “·”
(multiplication) satisfying:
1) a + b and a · b are performed in F2 for a, b ∈ F2 ;

2

IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION THEORY, VOL. X, NO. XX, MONTH YEAR

2) a + X = X + a = X for a ∈ F2 ;
3) 0 · X = X · 0 = 0 for the additive identity 0;
4) 1 · X = X · 1 = X.
The element X is termed an unknown logic value.
Now consider a test output b = (b1 , . . . , bn ) ∈ {0, 1}n
and a reference output c = (c1 , . . . , cn ) ∈ {0, 1, X}n . When
ci ∈ {0, 1}, the test and reference outputs agree on the ith
bit when bi = ci ; otherwise the ith bit is an error bit. When
ci = X, whatever the value of bi , no error is detected. Thus
the ith bit is (known to be) in error if and only if bi + ci = 1,
using addition in X2 .
Turning to the second problem, an X-compact matrix is an
n × m matrix H with elements from {0, 1}. The compaction
ratio of H is n/m. The number of 1s in the ith row is the
weight, or fan-out, of row i. Output (or response) compaction
is performed by computing the vector d = (d1 , . . . , dm ) = bH
for output (arithmetic is in X2 ). In the same way, the reference
output can be compacted using the same matrix to form r =
(r1 , . . . , rm ) = cH. As before, if di 6= ri and ri 6= X (that is,
if di + ri = 1), an error is detected.
To be of practical value, an X-compact matrix H should
detect the presence of error bits in b with respect to c given
the compacted vectors d and r under ‘reasonable’ restrictions
on the number of errors and number of unknown logic values.
Suppose that bℓ + cℓ = 1 (so that there is a fault to be
detected). In principle, whenever hℓj = 1, the fault could be
observed on output j. Let L =P
{j : hℓj = 1}. Suppose then
n
that j ∈ L. If it happens that i=1 ci hij = X, the error at
position ℓ is masked for output j (that is, dj + rj = X, and
no error is observed). On the other hand, if
dj + rj =

n
X
i=1

bi hij +

n
X
i=1

ci hij =

n
X

(bi + ci )hij = 0

i=1

then no error is observed. This occurs when there are an even
number of values of i for which hij = 1 and bi + ci = 1;
because this holds when i = ℓ by hypothesis, the error at
position ℓ is canceled for output j when the number of such
errors is even. When an error is masked or canceled for every
output j ∈ L, it is not detected. Otherwise, it is detected by
an output that is neither masked nor canceled.
Treating X’s as erasures and using traditional codes can
increase the error detectability of an X-compactor [17]. Unfortunately, this involves postprocessing test responses and
cannot be easily implemented [12]. Therefore, we focus on
X-compaction in which an error is only detected by the simple
comparison described here.
There are numerous criteria in defining a “good” X-compact
matrix. It should have a high compaction ratio and be able to
detect any faulty circuit behavior anticipated in actual testing.
Power requirements, compactor delay, and wireability dictate
that the weight of each row in a matrix be small to meet
practical limitations on fan-in and fan-out [11], [16].
The fundamental problem in X-tolerant response compaction is to design an X-compact matrix with large compaction ratio that detects faulty circuit behavior. To achieve
this, X-codes (which represent X-compact matrices) were
introduced [14]. In this section, we discuss basic properties

of X-codes. In order to investigate X-codes from coding and
design theoretic views, we introduce an equivalent definition.
Consider two m-dimensional vectors s1
=
(1) (1)
(1)
(2) (2)
(2)
(s1 , s2 , . . . , sm ) and s2 = (s1 , s2 , . . . , sm ), where

denoted by s1 ⊕ s2 ; that is,

where si ∨ sk = 0 if si = sk = 0, otherwise 1. An
m-dimensional vector s1 covers an m-dimensional vector s2
if s1 ∨ s2 = s1 .
For a finite set S = {s1 , . . . , ss } of m-dimensional vectors,
define

S = s1 ⊕ · · · ⊕ ss and

When S =L
{s1 } isWa singleton,
S = S = s1 . For S = ∅
we define
S = S = 0, the zero vector.
Let d be a positive integer and x a nonnegative integer.
An (m, n, d, x) X-code X = {s1 , s2 , . . . , sn } is a set of mdimensional vectors over F2 such that |X | = n and

for any pair of mutually disjoint subsets S1 and S2 of X with
|S1 | = x and 1 ≤ |S2 | ≤ d. A vector si ∈ X is a codeword.
(i)
(i)
The weight of a codeword si is |{sj 6= 0 : sj ∈ si }|. The
ratio n/m is the compaction ratio of X . An X-code forming
an orthonormal basis of the m-dimensional linear space over
F2 is trivial.
Roughly speaking, an X-code is a set of codewords such
that for every positive integer d′ ≤ d no superimposed sum of
any x codewords covers the vector obtained by adding up any
d′ codewords chosen from the rest of the n − x codewords.
Now we present a method of designing an X-compact matrix
from an X-code.
Proposition 1: There exists an (m, n, d, x) X-code X if and
only if there exists an n × m X-compact matrix H which
detects any combination of d′ faults (1 ≤ d′ ≤ d) in the
presence of at most x unknown logic values.
Proof: First we prove necessity. Assume that X is an
(m, n, d, x) X-code. Write X = {s1 , s2 , . . . , sn }, where si =
(i) (i)
(i)
(s1 , s2 , . . . , sm ) for 1 ≤ i ≤ n. Define an n × m matrix
(i)
H = (hi,j ) as hi,j = sj . We show that H forms an Xcompact matrix that detects a fault if the test output b contains
d′ error bits, 1 ≤ d′ ≤ d, and up to x Xs.
Let E = {k : bk + ck = 1}, the set of indices of error bits,
have cardinality d′ . Let X = {k : ck = X}, the set of indices
of unknown logic values, have cardinality x. Now comparing
dℓ and rℓ ,

with operations performed in X2 . Because the set of rows of
H forms the set of codewords of X , no superimposed sum of
x rows covers the vector obtained by an addition of any d′
rows. Hence there exists a column c such that
X

1 · hk,c = 1 and
X · hk,c = 0.

k∈X

Then (1) and (2) imply dc + rc = 1, that is, H detects a fault.
Because (2) holds if and only if the right hand side of (1)
equals one for l = c, sufficiency is straightforward.
By virtue of this equivalence, we can employ various
known results and techniques in coding theory to design an
X-compactor with good error detection ability, X-tolerance,
and a high compaction ratio. For the case when x = 0, an
(m, n, d, 0) X-code forms an n × m X-compact matrix which
is a parity-check matrix of a binary linear code of length n and
minimum distance d. In fact, since the condition that x = 0
implies the absence of Xs, this special case is reduced to
traditional space compaction. Because our focus is compaction
in the presence of unknown logic values, we assume that x ≥ 1
henceforth unless otherwise stated. In the absence of Xs, see
[18], [19].
By definition, an (m, n, d, x) X-code, d ≥ 2, is also an
(m, n, d − 1, x) X-code. Also an (m, n, d, x) X-code forms an
(m, n, d, x − 1) X-code. Moreover, an (m, n, d, x) X-code is
an (m, n, d + 1, x − 1) X-code [14].
It can be difficult to design an X-compactor having both the
necessary error detectability and the exact number of inputs
needed. One trivial solution is to discard codewords from a
larger X-code with sufficient error detection ability and Xtolerance. The following is another simple way to adjust the
number of inputs.
Proposition 2: If
an
(m, n, d, x)
X-code
and
an (m′ , n′ , d′ , x′ ) X-code exist, there exists an
(m + m′ , n + n′ , min{d, d′ }, min{x, x′ }) X-code.
Proof: Let X = {s1 , . . . , sn } be an (m, n, d, x) Xcode and Y = {t1 , . . . , tn′ } an (m′ , n′ , d′ , x′ ) X-code.
(i)
(i)
Extend each codeword si = (s1 , . . . , sm ) of X by appending m′ 0’s so that extended vectors have the form
(i)
(i)
s′i = (s1 , . . . , sm , 0, . . . , 0). Similarly extend each codeword
(j)
(j)
tj = (t1 , . . . , tm′ ) of Y by appending m 0s so that extended
(j)
(j)
vectors have the form t′j = (0, . . . , 0, t1 , . . . , tm′ ). The
extended (m + m′ )-dimensional vectors form an (m + m′ , n +
n′ , min{d, d′ }, min{x, x′ }) X-code.
Proposition 2 says that given an (m, n, d, x) X-code, a
codeword of weight less than or equal to x does not essentially
contribute to the compaction ratio (see also [14]). In fact,
(i)
(i)
if X contains such a codeword si = (s1 , . . . , sm ), there
(i)
exists at least one coordinate m′ such that sm′ = 1 and
(j)
sm′ = 0 for any other codeword sj ∈ X . Hence we can
delete si and coordinate m′ from X while keeping d and x.
By applying Proposition 2 and combining a trivial X-code
and another X-code, we can obtain an X-code having the
same number of codewords with compaction ratio no smaller.
For this reason, when constructing an (m, n, d, x) X-code
explicitly, we assume that every codeword has weight greater
than x.

3

Let M (m, d, x) be the maximum number n of codewords
for which there exists an (m, n, d, x) X-code. More codewords
means a higher compaction ratio. Hence an (m, n, d, x) Xcode satisfying n = M (m, d, x) is optimal.
Determining the exact value of M (m, d, x) seems difficult
except for M (m, 1, 1). As pointed out in [14], a special case
of M (m, d, x) has been extensively studied in the context of
superimposed codes [20]. An (1, x)-superimposed code of size
m × n is an m × n matrix S with entries in F2 such that no
superimposed sum of any x columns of S covers any other
column of S. Superimposed codes are also called cover-free
families and disjunct matrices.
By definition, a (1, x)-superimposed code of size m × n is
equivalent to the transpose of an X-compact matrix obtained
from an (m, n, 1, x) X-code. Hence known results on the
maximum ratio n/m for superimposed codes immediately
give information about M (m, 1, x). For completeness, we list
useful results on M (m, 1, x).
By Sperner’s theorem,
Theorem 2.1: (see [21], [22]) For m ≥ 2 an integer,


m
M (m, 1, 1) ≤
.
⌊m/2⌋

Indeed by taking all the m-dimensional vectors of weight
⌊m/2⌋ as codewords, we attain the bound. The same argument
is also found in [14].
The following is a simple upper bound on M (m, 1, x):
Theorem 2.2: [22] For any x ≥ 2,
log2 M (m, 1, x) ≤

cm log2 x
x2

for some constant c.
Several different proofs of Theorem 2.2 are known. Bounds
on the constant c are approximately two in [23], approximately
four in [24], and approximately eight in [25].
The asymptotic behavior of the maximum possible number
of codewords has been also investigated for superimposed
codes. Define the ratio R(x) as
log2 M (m, 1, x)
.
m→∞
m
The best lower bound R(x) ≤ R(x) can be found in
[26] and the best upper bound R(x) ≥ R(x) in [23]. The
descriptive asymptotic form of the best bounds as x → ∞ is
R(x) = lim

R(x) ∼

and R(x) ∼
x2 log2 e

where e is Napier’s constant. For a detailed summary of the
known lower and upper bounds, see [27]. Constructions with
many codewords have been studied in [28], [29]. See also
[30]–[33] and references therein.
III. X-C OMPACTORS

WITH

S MALL FAN -O UT

In this section we consider an X-compactor having sufficient
tolerance for errors and Xs, a high compaction ratio, and small
fan-out. This section is divided into four parts. Subsection
III-A deals with background and known results of the fanout problem in X-compactors. Then in Subsection III-B we
investigate X-codes that tolerate up to two X’s and have

4

IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION THEORY, VOL. X, NO. XX, MONTH YEAR

the minimum fan-out. X-Codes with further error detection
ability and X-tolerance are investigated in Subsection III-C. In
Subsection III-D we give a brief overview of the performance
of our X-codes given in this section and compare them with
other codes.
A. Background: Fan-Out in X-Codes
X-compact reduces the number of bits in the compacted
output while keeping error detection ability by propagating
each single bit to many signal lines. In fact, each output of
the X-compactor in [12] connects to about half of all inputs.
However, larger fan-in increases power requirements, area, and
delay [16]. When these disadvantages are concerns, fan-out of
inputs of a compactor should be small to reduce fan-in values.
In terms of X-codes, the required fan-out of input i in an
X-compactor is the weight of codeword si of the X-code.
Hence, in order to address the fan-out problem, it is desirable
for a codeword to have small weight. However, as mentioned
in Section I, an (m, n, d, x) X-code containing a codeword
with weight at most x is not essential in the sense of the
compaction ratio. Hence, throughout this section, we restrict
ourselves to (m, n, d, x) X-codes in which every codeword has
weight precisely x + 1, namely constant weight codes.
When a compactor is required to tolerate only a single unknown logic value, fan-out is minimized when every codeword
of an X-code has constant weight two. This extreme case was
addressed in [16] by considering a simple graph. We briefly
restate their theorems in terms of X-codes.
A graph G is a pair (V, E) such that V is a finite set and
E is a set of pairs of distinct elements of V . An element of
V is called a vertex, and an element of E is called an edge.
The girth g of G is the minimal size |C| of a subset C ⊂ E
such that each vertex appearing in C is contained in exactly
two edges.
The edge-vertex incidence matrix H of a graph G = (V, E)
is a |E| × |V | binary matrix H = (hi,j ) such that rows and
columns are indexed by edges and vertices respectively and
hi,j = 1 if the ith edge contains the jth vertex, otherwise 0.
By considering the edge-vertex incidence matrix of a graph
and Proposition 1, we obtain:
Theorem 3.1: [16] There exists a graph G = (V, E) of girth
g if and only if there exists a (|V |, |E|, g − 2, 1) X-code of
constant weight two.
Theorem 3.2: [16] A set X of m-dimensional vectors is an
(m, n, d − 1, 1) X-code of constant weight two if and only if
it is an (m, n, d, 0) X-code of weight two.
These two theorems say that in order to design an Xcompactor with high error detection ability, we only need to
find a graph with large girth. The same argument is also found
in [14]. For existence of such graphs and more details on Xcodes of constant weight two, see [16] and references therein.
B. Two X’s and Fan-Out Three
Multiple X’s can occur; here we present X-codes that are
tolerant to two X’s and have the maximum compaction ratio.
To accept up to two unknown logic values, we need an X-code

of constant weight three. We employ a well-known class of
combinatorial designs.
A set system is an ordered pair (V, B) such that V is a finite
set of points, and B is a family of subsets (blocks) of V . A
Steiner t-design S(t, k, v) is a set system (V, B), where V is
a finite set of cardinality v and B is a family of k-subsets of
V such that each t-subset of V is contained in exactly one
block. Parameters v and k are the order and block size of a
Steiner t-design. When t = 2 and k = 3, an S(2, 3, v) is a
Steiner triple system of order v, STS(v). An STS(v) exists if
and only if v ≡ 1, 3 (mod 6) [34]. A triple packing of order
v is a set system (V, B) such that B is a family of triples of
a finite set V of cardinality v and any pair of elements of V
appear in B at most once. An STS(v) is a triple packing of
order v ≡ 1, 3 (mod 6) containing the maximum number of
triples.
The point-block incidence matrix of a set system (V, B)
is the binary |V | × |B| matrix H = (hi,j ) such that rows
are indexed by points, columns are indexed by blocks, and
hi,j = 1 if the ith point is contained in the jth block, otherwise
0. The block-point incidence matrix is its transpose.
When d = 1, an (m, n, 1, 2) X-code of constant weight three
is equivalent to a (1, 2)-superimposed code of size m × n of
constant column weight three. It is well known that the pointblock incidence matrix of an S(t, k, v) forms
 an (1, ⌈k/(t −
1)⌉ − 1)-superimposed code of size v × vt / kt . Hence, by
using an STS(v), we obtain for every v ≡ 1, 3 (mod 6) a
(v, v(v − 1)/6, 1, 2) X-code. An upper bound on the number
of codewords of (1, 2)-superimposed codes of constant weight
k is available:
Theorem 3.3: [35] Let nk (m) denote the maximum number
of columns of a (1, 2)-superimposed code such that and every
column is of length m and has constant weight k. Then,

m
n2t−1 (m) ≤ n2t (m + 1) ≤

t

2t−1
t

with equality if and only if there exists a Steiner t-design
S(t, 2t − 1, m).
The following is an immediate consequence:
Theorem 3.4: For any (m, n, 1, 2) X-code of constant
with equality if and only if there
weight three, n ≤ m(m−1)
6
exists an STS(m).
Hence for d = 1, x = 2, and fan-out three, an X-code from
any STS(v) has the maximum compaction ratio (v − 1)/6.
One may ask for larger error detectability of an (m, n, 1, 2)
X-code when one (or zero) unknown logic value is assumed.
An (m, n, d, x) X-code is also an (m, n, d + 1, x − 1) X-code,
and hence any (m, n, 1, 2) X-code from an STS(m) is also an
(m, n, 2, 1) X-code. However, a careful choice of Steiner triple
systems gives higher error detectability while maintaining the
compaction ratio.
A configuration C in a triple packing, (V, B), is a subset
C ⊆ B. The set of points appearing in at least one block of a
configuration C is denoted by V (C). Two configurations C and
C ′ are isomorphic, denoted C ∼
= C ′ , if there exists a bijection
′
φ : V (C) → V (C ) such that for each block B ∈ C, the image
φ(B) is a block in C ′ . When |C| = i, a configuration C is an
i-configuration. A configuration C is even if for every point

FUJIWARA AND COLBOURN: A COMBINATORIAL APPROACH TO X-TOLERANT COMPACTION CIRCUITS

a appearing in C the number |{B : a ∈ B ∈ C}| of blocks
containing a is even. Because every block in a triple packing
has three points, no i-configuration for i odd is even.
A triple packing is r-even-free if for every integer i satisfying 1 ≤ i ≤ r it contains no even i-configurations. By
definition every r-even-free triple packing, r ≥ 2, is also
(r − 1)-even-free. For an even integer r, an r-even-free triple
packing is also (r + 1)-even-free. Every triple packing is
trivially 3-even-free. For v > 3 an STS(v) may or may not be
4-even-free. Up to isomorphism, the only even 4-configuration
is the Pasch configuration. It can be written on six points
and four blocks: {{a, b, c}, {a, d, e}, {f, b, d}, {f, c, e}}. For
the list of all the small configurations in a triple packing and
more complete treatments, we refer the reader to [34] and [36].
Because a 4-even-free STS is 5-even-free, an STS is 5-evenfree if and only if it contains no Pasch configuration.
Lemma 3.5: If there exists a 5-even-free STS(v), there
exists a (v, v(v − 1)/6, 3, 1) X-code of constant weight three.
The code is a (v, v(v − 1)/6, 5, 0) X-code of constant weight
three.
Proof: Let (V, B) be a 5-even-free STS(v). For every
Bi ∈ B define a v-dimensional vector si such that each
(i)
coordinate sj ∈ si is indexed by a distinct point j ∈ V
(i)
and sj = 1 if j ∈ Bi , otherwise 0. Then we obtain a
(v, v(v − 1)/6, 1, 2) X-code S = {si : Bi ∈ B} of constant
weight three. We prove that S is a (v, v(v − 1)/6, 3, 1) X-code
that is also a (v, v(v − 1)/6, 5, 0) X-code. By definition, for
1 ≤ i ≤ 5 no i-configuration C ⊆ B is even. Hence
M
{si : Bi ∈ C} =
6 0.
This implies that S is a (v, v(v − 1)/6, 5, 0) X-code. On the
other hand, since no pair of points appears twice, for any
mutually distinct blocks Bi , Bj , Bk ∈ B,
si 6= sj and si ∨ (sj ⊕ sk ) 6= si .
It remains to show that no codeword in S covers addition
of three others. Suppose to the contrary that there exist four
distinct codewords si , sj , sk , and sl such that
si ∨ (sj ⊕ sk ⊕ sl ) = si .
Because no pair of points appears twice and every block has
exactly three points, the only possible case is that the 4configuration {Bi , Bj , Bk , Bl } forms a Pasch configuration,
and hence it is even, a contradiction.
Steiner triple systems avoiding Pasch configurations have
been long studied as anti-Pasch STSs [34].
Theorem 3.6: [37] There exists a 5-even-free STS(v) if and
only if v ≡ 1, 3 (mod 6) and v 6∈ {7, 13}.
By combining Theorem 3.6 and Lemma 3.5, we obtain:
Theorem 3.7: For every v ≡ 1, 3 (mod 6) and v 6∈ {7, 13},
there exists a (v, v(v − 1)/6, 1, 2) X-code of constant weight
three that is a (v, v(v − 1)/6, 3, 1) X-code and a (v, v(v −
1)/6, 5, 0) X-code.
An X-compactor designed from these can detect any odd
number of errors unless there is an unknown logic value. One
may want to take advantage of the high compaction ratio of
the optimal (m, n, 1, 2) X-codes arising from 4-even-free STSs

5

when there is only a small possibility that more than two Xs
occur or multiple errors happen with multiple Xs. Our X-codes
from 4-even-free STSs also have high performance in such
situations:
Theorem 3.8: The probability that a (v, v(v − 1)/6, 1, 2) Xcode from a 4-even-free STS(v) fails to detect a single error
162(v−3)2
when there are exactly three Xs is (v+2)(v+3)(v−4)(v
2 −v−18) .
Proof: Because there is only one error, an X-code fails
to detect this error when all three points in the block that
corresponds to the error are contained in at least one block
corresponding to an X. The number of occurrences of each 4configuration in an STS(v) is determined by v and the number
of Pasch configurations (see [34], for example). A simple
calculation proves the assertion.
Theorem 3.9: The probability that a (v, v(v − 1)/6, 1, 2)
X-code from a 4-even-free STS(v) fails to detect errors
when there are exactly two Xs and exactly two errors is
1296
(v+2)(v+3)(v−4)(v 2 −v−18) .
Proof: A (v, v(v − 1)/6, 1, 2) X-code from a 4-evenfree STS(v) fails to detect errors when there are exactly two Xs and exactly two errors only when corresponding four blocks form a 4-configuration isomorphic to
{{a, b, c}, {d, e, f }, {a, e, g}, {c, f, g}} where the first two
blocks represent Xs and the other two blocks correspond to
errors. The number of occurrences of the 4-configuration in
a 4-even-free STS(v) is v(v−1)(v−3)
, and the total number of
4
v(v−1) 
6
occurrences of all 4-configurations is
[34]. Divide
4
 v(v−1) 
v(v−1)(v−3)
4
6
to obtain the probability that the
by 2
4
4
X-code fails to detect the two errors.
Hence when a 4-even-free STS of sufficiently large order
is used, the probability that the corresponding X-code fails to
detect errors when the sum of the numbers of errors and Xs
is at most four is close to zero. A more complicated counting
argument is necessary to calculate the performance of X-codes
from STSs when the sum of the numbers of errors and Xs is
greater than four. For more complete treatments and current
research results on counting configurations in Steiner triple
systems, we refer the reader to [36] and references therein.
Useful explicit constructions for 5-even-free STS(v) can be
found in [34], [37]–[41]. The cyclic 5-sparse Steiner triple
systems in [42] provide examples of 5-even-free STS(v) for
v ≤ 97, because cyclic 5-sparse systems are all anti-Pasch.
Further r-even-freeness improves the error detectability of the
resulting X-code:
Theorem 3.10: For r ≥ 4, if there exists an r-even-free
triple packing (V, B), there exists a (|V |, |B|, 1, 2) X-code of
constant weight three that is also a (|V |, |B|, 3, 1) X-code and
a (|V |, |B|, r, 0) X-code.
Proof: Let (V, B) be an r-even-free triple packing of order
v. For every Bi ∈ B define a v-dimensional vector si such
(i)

j ∈ V and sj = 1 if j ∈ Bi , otherwise 0. Then we obtain a
(|V |, |B|, 1, 2) X-code S = {si : Bi ∈ B} of constant weight
three. It suffices to prove that S forms a (|V |, |B|, r, 0) X-code.
Suppose to the contrary that S is not a (|V |, |B|, r, 0) X-code.

sj . . . , sk such that
si ⊕ sj · · · ⊕ sk = 0.
However, the set of the corresponding blocks Bi , Bj ,. . . ,Bk
forms an even r′ -configuration, a contradiction.
One may want an r-even-free STS with large r to obtain
higher error detection ability while keeping the maximum
compaction ratio. Although it is known that every Steiner triple
system has a configuration with seven or fewer blocks so that
every element of the configuration belongs to at least two [36],
it may happen that none of these are even. Nevertheless, the
following gives an upper bound of even-freeness of Steiner
triple systems.
Theorem 3.11: For v > 3 there exists no 8-even-free
STS(v).
Proof: Suppose to the contrary that there exists an
STS(v), S, that is 8-even free. Consider a 4-configuration
C isomorphic to {{a, b, e}, {c, d, e}, {a, c, f }, {b, d, g}}; the
points f and g are each contained in exactly one block.
For any anti-Pasch STS(v) the number of occurrences of
configurations isomorphic to C is v(v − 1)(v − 3)/4 [43] (see

also [44]). Because v ≥ 7, we have v(v − 1)(v − 3)/4 > v2 .
Hence there is a pair of configurations A and B such that
A ∼
= C and they share the two points contained in
= B ∼
exactly one block. In other words, there exists a pair A and
B having the form {{a, b, e}, {c, d, e}, {a, c, f }, {b, d, g}} and
{{a′ , b′ , e′ }, {c′ , d′ , e′ }, {a′ , c′ , f }, {b′ , d′ , g}} respectively. If
there is no common block between A and B, then the merged
configuration A ∪ B forms an even configuration consisting
of eight blocks, a contradiction. Otherwise, there is at least
one block contained in both A and B. Removing blocks
shared between A and B from their union, we obtain an even
configuration on four or six blocks, a contradiction.
By combining Theorems 3.4, 3.10, and 3.11, we have:
Theorem 3.12: There exists no (m, n, 1, 2) X-code that
achieves the maximum compaction ratio (m − 1)/6 and is
also an (m, n, 3, 1) X-code and an (m, n, 8, 0) X-code.
An STS is 7-even-free if and only if it is 6-evenfree. Up to isomorphism, there are two kinds of even 6configurations which may appear in an STS. One is called
the grid and the other is the double triangle. Both 6configurations are described by nine points and six blocks:
{{a, b, c}, {d, e, f }, {g, h, i}, {a, d, g}, {b, e, h}, {c, f, i}} and
{{a, b, c}, {a, d, e}, {c, f, e}, {b, g, h}, {d, h, i}, {f, g, i}} respectively. By definition, an STS is 6-even-free if it simultaneously avoids Pasches, grids, and double triangles. We do
not know whether there exists a 6-even-free STS(v) for any
v > 3. However, a moderately large number of triples can be
included while keeping 6-even-freeness:
Theorem 3.13: There exists a constant c > 0 such that for
sufficiently large v there exists a 6-even-free triple packing of
order v with cv 1.8 triples.
Proof: Let C ′ be a set of representatives of all of the
nonisomorphic even configurations on six or fewer triples and
let C ′′ be a configuration consisting of pair of distinct triples
sharing a pair of elements. Let C = C ′ ∪ C ′′ . Pick uniformly

its expected value. Then

also a (v, cv 1.8 , 3, 1) X-code and a (v, cv 1.8 , 6, 0) X-code.
An STS(v) has approximately v 2 /6 triples. The same technique can be used to obtain a lower bound on ex(v, r) for

C. Higher X-Tolerance with the Minimum Fan-Out
In general, the probability that a defective digital circuit
produces an error at a specific signal output line is quite small.
In fact, several errors are unlikely happen simultaneously [11],
[45]. Also, multiple Xs with errors are rare [12]. Therefore, Xcodes given in Theorems 3.7 and 3.13 are particularly useful
for relatively simple scan-based testing such as built-in selftest (BIST) where the tester is only required to detect defective
chips. Nonetheless, more sophisticated X-codes are also useful
to improve test quality and/or to identify or narrow down the
error sources by taking advantage of more detailed information
about when incorrect responses are produced [12]. Hence, for
use in higher quality testing and error diagnosis support, it
is of theoretical and practical interest to consider (m, n, d, x)
X-codes of constant weight x + 1, where x ≥ 3 or d ≥ 6.
For (m, n, 1, 2) X-codes of constant weight three, we employed Theorem 3.3 to obtain an upper bound on the number
of codewords. The following theorem gives a generalized
upper bound:
Theorem 3.15: [46] Let n(x, m, k) denote the maximum
number of columns of a (1, x)-superimposed code such that
every column is of length m and has constant weight k. Then,
for every x, t and i = 0, 1 or i ≤ x/2t2 ,

for all sufficiently large m, with equality if and only if there
exists a Steiner t-design S(t, x(t − 1) + 1, m − i).
By putting t = 2 and i = 0, we obtain:

weight x + 1,
  

m
x+1
n≤

2
for all sufficiently large m, with equality if and only if there
is an S(2, x + 1, m).
Because the set of columns of the block-point incidence
matrix of any S(2, x + 1, m) forms an (m, m(m − 1)/x(x +
1), 1, x) X-code of constant weight x + 1, the existence of
Steiner 2-designs is our next interest. For k ∈ {4, 5}, necessary
and sufficient conditions for existence of an S(2, k, v) are
known:
Theorem 3.17: [47] There exists an S(2, 4, v) if and only
if v ≡ 1, 4 (mod 12).
Theorem 3.18: [48] There exists an S(2, 5, v) if and only
if v ≡ 1, 5 (mod 20).
For k ≥ 6, the necessary and sufficient conditions on v
for existence of an S(2, k, v) are not known in general; the
existence of a Steiner 2-design is solved only in an asymptotic
sense [49], although for ‘small’ values of k substantial results
are known. For a comprehensive table of known Steiner 2designs, see [50].
As with X-codes from Steiner triple systems, the error
detectability can be improved by considering avoidance of
even configurations.
An S(2, k, v), (V, B), is r-even-free if for 1 ≤ i ≤ r
it contains no subset C ⊆ B such that |C| = i and each
point appearing in C is contained in exactly an even number

7

of blocks in C. A generalized Pasch configuration in an
S(2, k, v), (V, B), is a subset C ⊂ B such that |C| = k + 1 and
each point appearing in C is contained exactly two blocks of
C. As with triple systems, an S(2, k, v) is (k + 1)-even-free if
and only if it contains no generalized Pasch configurations.
Theorem 3.19: If an r-even-free S(2, k, v) for r ≥ k + 1
exists, there exists a (v, v(v − 1)/k(k − 1), 1, k − 1) X-code
of constant weight k that is also a (v, v(v − 1)/k(k − 1), k, 1)
X-code and a (v, v(v − 1)/k(k − 1), r, 0) X-code.
Proof: Let (V, B) be an r-even-free S(2, k, v). For every
Bi ∈ B define a v-dimensional vector si such that each
(i)
coordinate sj ∈ si is indexed by a distinct point j ∈ V
(i)
and sj = 1 if j ∈ Bi , otherwise 0. Then we obtain a
(v, v(v − 1)/k(k − 1), 1, k − 1) X-code S = {si : Bi ∈ B} of
constant weight k. By definition of an r-even-free S(2, k, v),
it is straightforward to see that S is also a (v, v(v − 1)/k(k −
1), r, 0) X-code. It suffices to prove that S can also be used
as a (v, v(v − 1)/k(k − 1), k, 1) X-code. Assume that this is
not the case. Then, by following the argument in the proof of
Lemma 3.5, B contains a generalized Pasch configuration, a
contradiction.
Existence of an r-even-free design has been investigated
in the study of erasure-resilient codes for redundant array of
independent disks (RAID) [51]. In fact, infinitely many r-evenfree S(2, k, v)s can be obtained from affine spaces over Fq
[52].
Theorem 3.20: [52] For any odd prime power q and positive
integer n ≥ 2 the points and lines of AG(n, q) form a (2q−1)even-free S(2, q, q n ).
By combining Theorems 3.19 and 3.20, we obtain:
Theorem 3.21: For any odd prime power q and positive
integer n ≥ 2, there exists a (q n , q n−1 (q n −1)/(q−1), 1, q−1)
X-code of constant weight q that is also an (q n , q n−1 (q n −
1)/(q − 1), q, 1) X-code and a (q n , q n−1 (q n − 1)/(q − 1), 2q −
1, 0) X-code.
D. Characteristics of X-Codes from Combinatorial Designs
We have given tight upper bounds of compaction ratio for
(m, n, 1, x) X-codes with the minimum fan-out and presented
explicit construction methods for X-codes that attain the
bounds. As far as the authors are aware, these are the first
mathematical bounds and construction techniques for this type
of optimal X-code with constant weight greater than two.
Optimal X-codes given in Theorems 3.7 and 3.21 in particular
have higher error detection ability when the number of Xs
is smaller than x. The known construction technique using
hypergraphs, briefly mentioned in [16], can not guarantee the
same error detection ability.
To illustrate the usefulness of our X-codes, here we compare
the error detection ability of an example X-code that can
be generated using Theorem 3.7 with characteristics of Xcodes proposed in [11]. The probability that the example
(50, 500, 1, 1) X-code in Table 5 in [11] fails to detect a single
error when there are exactly two Xs is around 4.2 × 10−6 .
The fan-out of this code is 11. Our X-code from Theorem
3.7, which has the same compaction ratio, has parameters
(61, 610, 1, 2). The probability that this X-code fails to detect

8

IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION THEORY, VOL. X, NO. XX, MONTH YEAR

a single error in the same situation is exactly 0. Its fan-out
is 3, which is significantly smaller. While the multiple error
detection ability of the (50, 500, 1, 1) X-code is not specified
in [11], our code can always detect up to three errors when
there is only one X, and up to five errors when there is no X.
By Theorem 3.9 the probability that our (61, 610, 1, 2) X-code
fails to detect errors when there are exactly two Xs and two
errors is 1.5 × 10−6 . Therefore, our X-code is ideal when the
fan-out problem is critical and/or fault-free simulation rarely
produces three or more Xs in an expected response.
Very large optimal X-codes with very high error detecting
ability and compaction ratio can be easily constructed by the
same method. For example, Theorem 3.7 and known results
on anti-Pasch STSs immediately give a (601, 60100, 1, 2) Xcode with fan-out 3 and compaction ratio 100. This code is
also a (601, 60100, 3, 1) X-code and a (601, 60100, 5, 0) Xcode. Moreover, the probability that it fails to detect errors
when there are exactly two Xs and two errors (or exactly
three Xs and a single error) is around 1.6 × 10−11 (or 7.3−7
respectively). As far as the authors know, there have been no
X-codes available that guarantee as high error detection ability
and have very small fan-out.
As Theorems 3.7, 3.8, and 3.9 indicate, larger X-codes
designed with this method have an even higher compaction
ratio and better error detection rate. Because discarding codewords does not affect error detection ability, one may use
part of a large X-code to achieve very high test quality when
compaction ratio can be compromised to an extent.
IV. X-C ODES

OF

A RBITRARY W EIGHT

The restriction to low-weight codewords severely limits the
compaction ratio of an X-code. Hence, when fan-in and fanout are not of concern, it is desirable to use X-codes with
arbitrary weight. In this section we study the compaction ratio
and construction methods of such general X-codes.
For d = x = 2, a (⌈log2 n⌉(⌈log2 n⌉ + 1), n, 2, 2) X-code
was constructed for any integer n ≥ 2 [14].
Theorem 4.1: [14] For any optimal (m, n, 2, 2) X-code,
m ≤ ⌈log2 n⌉(⌈log2 n⌉ + 1).
They also gave an explicit construction method of a
(3⌈log3 n⌉, n, 1, 3) X-code. In order to give a more general
construction, we employ design theoretic techniques for arrays. Let n ≥ w ≥ 2. A perfect hash family, PHF(N ; u, n, w),
is a set F of N functions f : Y → X where |Y | = u and
|X| = n, such that, for any C ⊆ Y with |C| = w, there exists
at least one function f ∈ F such that f |C is one-to-one. A
PHF(N ; u, n, w) can be described by a u × N matrix with
entries from a set of n symbols such that for any w rows there
exists at least one column in which each element is distinct.
Theorem 4.2: If an (m, n, d, x) X-code and a
PHF(N ; u, n, max{d, x} + 1) exist, there exists an
(mN, u, d, x) X-code.
Proof: Let H be a u × N n-ary matrix representing
a PHF(N ; u, n, max{d, x} + 1). Assign each codeword of
an (m, n, d, x) X-code to a distinct symbol of the PHF and
replace each entry of H by the m-dimensional row vector
representing the assigned codeword. Then we obtain a u×mN

binary matrix H ′ . Taking each row of H ′ as a codeword,
we obtain a set X of mN -dimensional vectors. It suffices to
show that for any two arbitrary subsets D, X ⊆ X satisfying
|D| = d′ ≤ d, |X| = x′ ≤ x, and D ∩ X = ∅, it holds that
_
M
_
( X) ∨ (
D) 6=
X.
(3)

By considering a one-to-one function in the PHF, for any
max{d, x} + 1 codewords of X at least one set of m
coordinates forms max{d, x} + 1 distinct codewords of the
original (m, n, d, x) X-code. Hence, for any choice of D
and X there exists a subset Y ⊆ X of cardinality |Y | =
max{0, d′ + x′ − (max{d, x} + 1)} such that at least one set
of m coordinates in D ∪ (X \ Y ) forms distinct codewords of
the original (m, n, d, x) X-code. Because |Y | ≤ d′ − 1 < |D|,
(3) holds for any D and X. Hence, the resulting set X forms
an (mN, u, d, x) X-code.
Since their introduction in [53], much progress has been
made on existence and construction techniques for perfect hash
families (see [54]–[58] for recent results). A concise list of
known results on perfect hash families is available in [50].
We can use perfect hash families from algebraic curves over
finite fields:
Theorem 4.3: [59] For positive integers n ≥ w, there
exists an explicit construction for an infinite family of
PHF(N ; u, n, w) such that N is O(log u).
Indeed when n is fixed, a perfect hash family with O(log u)
rows can be determined in polynomial time by a greedy
method [60].
By combining Theorems 4.2 and 4.3, we can construct
infinitely many (m, n, d, x) X-codes where m is O(log n).
Theorem 4.4: For any positive integer d and nonnegative
integer x, there exists an explicit construction for an infinite
family of (m, n, d, x) X-codes, where m is O(log n).
The following is a combinatorial recursion for X-codes.
Theorem
  4.5: If an (m, n, d, x) X-code and an
(ℓ, n, d2 , x) X-code exist, there exists an (ℓ + m, 2n, d, x)
X-code.
Proof: Let X = {s1 , . . . , sn }be an (m, n, d, x) X-code
and Y = {t1 , . . . , tn } an (ℓ, n, d2 , x) X-code. Extend each
(i)
(i)
codeword si = (s1 , . . . , sm ) of X by appending ℓ 0’s so that
(i)
(i)
extended vectors have the form s′i = (s1 , . . . , sm , 0, . . . , 0).
(i)
(i)
Extend each codeword ti = (t1 , . . . , tl ) of Y by combining si so that extended vectors have the form t′i =
(i)
(i) (i)
(i)
(s1 , . . . , sm , t1 , . . . , tl ). Define A = {s′1 , . . . , s′n }, B =
{t′1 , . . . , t′n }, and C = A ∪ B. We prove that C is an
(ℓ + m, 2n, d, x) X-code.
Take two subsets D, X ⊆ C satisfying |D| = d′ ≤ d,
|X| = x′ ≤ x, and D∩X = ∅. As in the proof of Theorem 4.2,
it suffices to show that for any choice of D and X the vector
obtained by adding all the codewords in D is not covered by
the superimposed sum of X, that is, (3) holds. Define a sur(i)
(i)
(i)
(i)
jection f of C to X as f : (c1 , . . . , cℓ+m ) 7→ (c1 , . . . , cm ).

(i)
surjection g of C to Y ∪ {0} as g : (c1 , . . . , cℓ+m ) 7→

Next, we present a simple nonconstructive existence result
for (m, n, d, x) X-codes.

m ≥ 2x+1 (d + x) log n,
there exists an (m, n, d, x) X-code.

there exists an (m, n, d, x) X-code.
Hence, for any optimal (m, n, d, x) X-code with n ≥
max{2d, d + x}, m is at most O(log n). For example, by
putting d = x = 2 we know that there exists an (m, n, d, x)
X-code if m ≥ 32 log n. This significantly improves the upper
bound in Theorem 4.1 proved in [14].
V. C ONCLUSIONS
By formulating X-tolerant space compaction of test responses combinatorially, an equivalent, alternative definition
of X-codes has been introduced. This combinatorial approach
gives general design methods for X-codes and bounds on
the compaction ratio. Using this model with restricted fanout leads to well-studied objects, the Steiner 2-designs. These
provide constructions for X-codes having sufficient error
detectability, X-tolerance, maximum compaction ratio, and
minimum fan-out. Constant weight X-codes with high error
detectability profit from a deep connection with configurations, particularly the Pasch configuration. The combinatorial
formulation of X-tolerant compaction can also be applied in
conjunction with another compaction technique (such as time
compaction). If a tester wants an X-compactor with additional
properties, the necessary structure of the compactor may be
expressed in design theoretic terms.
Our formulation can also be useful for the study of higher
error detectability and error diagnosis support employing the
appropriate assistance from an Automatic Test Equipment
(ATE) [12]. For example, the compaction technique called iCompact can be understood in terms of the model in Section
II [17].
The essential idea underlying Theorem 4.6 is the stochastic
coding technique for X-tolerant signature analysis [61]. We
used a naive value 1/2 as the probability p in the proof of
Theorem 4.6. To obtain a better constant coefficient, p should
be chosen so that it minimizes the expected value E(AX ), that
is, it should minimize

While this optimization does not affect the logarithmic order
in Theorem 4.6, it may help a tester determine the target compaction ratio and estimate the error cancellation and masking
rate of an X-tolerant Multiple Input Signature Register (XMISR) based on stochastic coding [61].
In this paper we focused on space compaction. Nevertheless,
time compaction is of great importance as well. We expect the
combinatorial formulation developed here to provide a useful
framework for exploring time compaction as well.

ABSTRACT
Breakthroughs in molecular profiling technologies are
enabling a new data-intensive approach to biomedical
research, with the potential to revolutionize how we
study, manage, and treat complex diseases. The next
great challenge for clinical applications of these
innovations will be to create scalable computational
solutions for intelligently linking complex biomedical
patient data to clinically actionable knowledge.
Traditional database management systems (DBMS) are
not well suited to representing complex syntactic and
semantic relationships in unstructured biomedical
information, introducing barriers to realizing such
solutions. We propose a scalable computational
framework for addressing this need, which leverages
a hypergraph-based data model and query language that
may be better suited for representing complex multilateral, multi-scalar, and multi-dimensional relationships.
We also discuss how this framework can be used
to create rapid learning knowledge base systems to
intelligently capture and relate complex patient data to
biomedical knowledge in order to automate the recovery
of clinically actionable information.

genomic interpretation require: (a) a fundamentally
different computational framework for storing and
representing disparate data types with complex
relationships, and (b) advanced software applications that leverage this framework to structure the
representation of prior knowledge so that it can be
intelligently linked to patient data. We propose
a framework conceptually based on requirements
and cognitive strategies for knowledge computing,
previously introduced as the BioIntelligence
Framework.2
Our framework is compatible with future directions toward computational intelligence. Since it
can support the capturing and querying of multilateral and multi-scalar relations among genomes,
phenotype, environment, lifestyle, medical history,
and clinical outcome data, our platform can
support systems with higher order functions such
as inference and learning. This will ultimately
allow genomic data to be intelligently repurposed
beyond personalized medicine to support more
sophisticated translational research and highly
iterative knowledge discovery.

BIOINTELLIGENCE FRAMEWORK
INTRODUCTION
Next generation genomic proﬁling technologies are
generating deep and detailed characterizations of
patients and disease states. This data-intensive
approach is providing unprecedented insights that
can be used to resolve mechanistic complexity and
clinical heterogeneity, thereby revolutionizing how
we study, manage, and treat complex diseases. To
support this revolution, bioinformatics tools are
rapidly emerging to process and analyze large-scale
complex molecular data sets for discovery research
applications. Unfortunately, when it comes to
clinical (n¼1) applications of genomics, the data
deluge is rapidly outpacing our capacity to interpret
rich data sets to extract medically useful and
meaningful knowledge. The next great challenge
will be to address the manual interpretation
bottleneck through the development of computational solutions for intelligently linking complex
patient data to actionable biomedical knowledge.
This illuminates a need to represent and query
large-scale complex relationships distributed across
disparate types of biomedical knowledge. A recent
report states a goal for the community is to transition from traditional database management to
managing potentially unstructured data across
many repositories.1
We propose the key challenges for intelligently
linking prior knowledge to partially automate
128

Systems biology is concerned with emergent
properties in complex interactions of systems of
systems involving disparate data elements.
Extracting useful information requires syntactic
and semantic linking of data within and across
large data sets. Systems modeled as networks based
on binary graphs (where edges connect node pairs)
are suited to capturing bilateral relationships and
interactions. To represent multilateral relationships
requires a fundamental change in how we model
systems. We generalize the binary graph model to
a hypergraph model, an approach which has been
previously suggested,3 and introduce a hypergraphbased solution for representing multilateral relations and multi-scalar networks.
Biological systems may beneﬁt from a ﬂexible
data model that supports nesting of data elements
and concept abstraction in a more natural manner
than functionally equivalent relational counterparts, and the ability to readily query across
multiple systems and abstraction layers representing complex relationships, leading to systems
compatible with learning, reasoning, and inferencing. Following a model for human intelligence,
information lives in different levels of the
neocortex: from highly variable data inputs, to
patterns, to patterns of patterns, to invariant
concepts.4 Inspired by this model of intelligence,
we extend the notion of a hypergraph to allow

Perspectives
links among edges to capture relationships that cross bounds of
scale and dimension, and develop a novel generic framework for
capturing information that can beneﬁt systems biology and
other areas.
We desire a solution that is ﬂexible to include various types of
data from disparate sources, extensible to scale to massive stores
of information, and accessible to permit the efﬁcient extraction
of patient-centric knowledge. Figure 1 outlines the architecture of
our BioIntelligence Framework, the components of which are:
1. A public hypergraph-based network for representing knowledge, including
a. A scalable hypergraph-like model for representing a knowledge network
b. Processes to automate populating and updating the
network with public domain knowledge from multiple sources
c. An efﬁcient database solution for storing the network
platform
2. A Patient Data Locker application built on top of the
knowledge network, including:

d. An accessible web-based solution for storing patient-centric
knowledge
e. Processes for structuring and formatting patient genomic
and health data, inducing patient-centric subgraphs on the
public hypergraph, and stratifying patients based on information in their lockers
3. A process for structuring and formatting analyst interpretation to facilitate feedback and rapid automated learning in
the system.

Public hypergraph
A graph is deﬁned G(V,E) where V is a set of vertices (nodes) and
E is a set of edges (links) between two vertices. A hypergraph is
a generalization of a graph in which an edge can connect any
number of vertices. Biological networks have traditionally been
modeled as graphs/networks. These graph models capture
bilateral relationships among node pairs. Using hypergraphs as
a modeling paradigm supports the characterization of multilateral relationships and processes.3 For example, in a general graph,

Perspectives
an edge might represent a relationship between a gene and
disease state. That relationship may change in the context of
a drug, and a hypergraph can represent this contextual knowledge with an edge containing all three elements.
Hypergraphs are proving useful for capturing semantic and
biomedical information in semantic web technologies for biological knowledge management and semantic knowledge
networks.5 6 Approaches to extracting knowledge from biological research literature to store in a hypergraph have been
proposed,7 8 with similar techniques used for population stratiﬁcation.9
To support a data intelligent system, we wish for information
to be stored not only explicitly in the data itself, but implicitly
in how the data are linked, and capture this in our model.
Abstraction is permitted by allowing hyperedges to contain
other edges, forming a nested graph structure. A machine
learning model called hierarchical temporal memory (HTM)
mimics the human neocortex.4 10 Inspired by this design, we
store knowledge at different levels of granularity, from single
points of data, to collections of points, abstracting out to
collections of collections. Thus, we perceive edges in lower levels
of abstraction as nodes in higher levels, thereby permitting the
network to be viewed and operated on within and across
different scales of abstraction. Information is stored on the
nodes and edges of the network and accessed via processes.
Populating the network platform requires processes to pull
different types of information from multiple sources, such as the
Cancer Biomedical Informatics Grid (caBIG) and BioWarehouse,11 12 and other tools and techniques.13e15 The processes
are represented as S0. Sm in ﬁgure 1, and take unstructured,
public domain knowledge as input and structures it as input to
the public network.
The most common database management system (DBMS) is
based on the relational data model, which is best suited to
capturing data structured in a predeﬁned schema, and presents
limitations in handling complexity and scalability.16 Our solution handles unstructured and semi-structured data, and is in
the scope of non-relational (NoSQL) databases, which do not
require pre-deﬁned schemas.16 17 Such databases include those
based on graph models and triplestores (eg, RDF), and are best
suited to capturing binary relationships between two elements
(a triplestore is even more restrictive as it is essentially
a ‘directed’ binary graph). To effectively represent multilateral
relationships and interactions present in biomedical data,
hypergraph-based approaches have been suggested.3 18e21 The
ﬂexibility granted by allowing elements to contain elements
allows processing knowledge at different levels of abstraction, in
a less restrictive way than hierarchical models that restrict the
network’s topology. HyperGraphDB resembles our model, but
uses a directed hypergraph and is built on a traditional database.22 Our model is more general, based on less restrictive
undirected edges, and intended to be implemented natively,
although a DBMS using our model may use other DB solutions
as a persistent data store. In fact, other solutions can be built on
our model as it is a generalization of other models.

Data model
An example use of our model is shown in ﬁgure 2. This example
captures multilateral, multiscalar, and multidimensional relationships using a general model (A), and viewing the network at
different levels of abstraction (B and C). The elements shown in
this solution are described in the legend of the image, and based
on a real-world problem we are exploring. A possible schema
model for a relational database capturing these same data can be
130

found in the online supplementary material, and demonstrates
the added effort involved in capturing these complex relationships in a SQL database.
The entities in ﬁgure 2 are represented as elements in our
database. An attribute is a key/value pair, and a list of attributes
(Attribute Set) is stored with each element. In this way, we can
arbitrarily add any type of attribute to an element without
changing the database structure. In the relational model, each
entity type requires its own table, with pre-deﬁned ﬁelds for
attributes, and adding an attribute requires adding a ﬁeld to the
table, and migrating the database. A characteristic of the relational model is that all entities of the same type are stored in the
same table. Our model is ﬂexible in that it does not require prestructuring data, but we can certainly mimic this behavior if
desired by enforcing a rule that requires all elements to have an
attribute with key¼‘type.’ Using our model, this decision is left
to the database designer, and not enforced by the model itself.
An element in our model can contain an arbitrary number of
other elements (allowing ‘has-a’ and ‘has-many’ relationships).
These elements are referenced in the ‘Internal Element Set’ of
the element. For example, in ﬁgure 2, element g is a gene and
contains three gene variant elements (v1, v2, v3) in its internal
element set. This is an example of a multi-lateral relationship as
g can be viewed as a ‘hyperedge’ in a hypergraph, connecting
three ‘nodes.’ While this behavior is easy to model in a relational
database, using a one-to-many relation, it becomes more
complex when an element contains an arbitrary number of
arbitrary types of elements. For example, the element R2
represents a molecular state, which in this case is a protein p
associated with a protein state ps1. In a relational database, we
can capture these relationships in a ‘molecular state’ table with
foreign key ﬁelds pointing to a ‘protein’ table and a ‘protein
state’ table. Now consider a molecular state that exists in the
context of a modiﬁer drug (ie, the state of the protein is
perturbed by a modiﬁer drug in a laboratory experiment). To
capture this in our model, we can simply create a new element
with three internal elements: p, ps1 and the element representing the modiﬁer drug. To capture this in the relational
database, we would need to either add a ﬁeld to the ‘molecular
state’ table, which may be blank for many records, or create
a new table with the three related ﬁelds. Both of the later
options require a change to the underlying data structure, and
migrating the database.
The elements shown in ﬁgure 2C represent higher-level
concepts and recursive nesting of elements at different levels,
illustrating the ability to ﬂexibly and efﬁciently capture multiscalar relationships among elements, the motivation behind our
data model. For example, note that R1 captures the relationship
that gene g codes for protein p. C1 captures the genetic event
concept, where gene variant v2 changes the state of the protein
(the molecular state represented by R3). C2 is a drug response
concept representing the higher-level concept that C1, in the
context of the pharmaceutical ph, leads to a changed molecular
state, R2. These combined biological and pharmacologic effects
lead to a change in disease state to ds2, captured by the clinical
response concept C3. The internal (nested) element sets contain
the topology of the network, that is, they deﬁne how entities are
related, and capture meaning in those relationships. Further
details to describe the nature of the relationships can always be
stored in attributes of the elements.
The ‘External Element Set’ of an element is the inverse of
internal element relations. For example, v1, v2, and v3 all have g
in their external element set. While it is not necessary to store
this information (the network of relationships among elements

aid in querying the database. We have deﬁned three new types of
queries associated with our model: recover, context, and expand.
The expand and context queries retrieve all internal and external
elements of an element, respectively, optionally limited by
modiﬁers presented with the query. Recover is a combination of
these, and returns both internal and external elements. All three
query actions have an optional level constraint, deﬁning how
deep to traverse the graph when retrieving related elements. For
instance, expand n will retrieve all internal elements, and their
internal elements, recursively up to n times. For instance, we can
view C3 as an abstraction; a clinical effect that we can relate to
patients and other concepts. Expanding C3 by one level shows
us that it represents a disease state ds2, triggered by a pharmacologic effect C2. Expanding C3 by two levels shows us the

details of the pharmacologic effect, and so on. In this way, we
can choose which level of abstraction we wish to view and
compute over, and we can create new concepts that cross these
layers of abstraction (multi-scalar relationships).
By the deﬁnition of the internal and external element sets, it
follows that our model naturally handles many-to-many relationships as well. In summary, we do not argue that a relational
database is incapable of capturing the types of relationships we
discuss here, rather that it requires more work, and added layers
of complexity to the underlying structure of the database, which
makes capturing and querying complex biomedical relationships
more difﬁcult. Our model is an abstraction of other models,
including relational, graph, hierarchical, and object-oriented, and
can therefore be used to model data represented using any and
all of these models at once. The potential beneﬁt of our model is

Patient data locker
Given a patient’s data (genomic, health, etc), we wish to recover
related knowledge from our network using BioIntelligence Tools
(BIT). The ﬁrst step (BIT1 in ﬁgure 1) is a process to structure
data as input to a process for inducing patient-relevant
subgraphs of the knowledge network (BIT2 in ﬁgure 1). BIT1
integrates many types of data sets across multiple databases to
support electronic medical and health records (EMR/EHRs), and
is designed as a modular based system to provide metadata and
indexing for queries.
The next step (BIT2 in ﬁgure 1) is a process to extract relevant
knowledge from the network based on individual patient
information. An induced subgraph H(S,T) of network G(V,E)
has the properties S3V, and for every vertex set Si of H, the set
Si is an edge of H if and only if it is an edge in G. That is, H has
the same edges that appear in G over the same set of nodes. We
say that H is an induced subgraph of G, and H is induced by S. In
our system, V is the set of nodes in the platform network G, and
S is the set of nodes that map to an individual’s genomic and
health information. Thus, a subgraph is induced by an individual
genome. The architecture in ﬁgure 1 shows an example public
hypergraph, and private subgraphs stored in a data locker. These
networks are detailed in ﬁgure 3, where the network on the left
is a public knowledge network, and the darkened nodes are
elements relevant to an individual’s information (based on input
patient data). The network on the top right is induced by this
information, and contains all of the darkened nodes, and edges
incident to them. Alternately, we can expand the information
retrieved to include all connected components of the induced
subgraph. An example of a connected-component induced
subgraph is shown on the bottom right of ﬁgure 3.
The most important characteristic of the data locker is that it
contains all relevant knowledge to facilitate clinical translation.
Induced subgraphs can be used to transform a large set of
patient-relevant data to smaller, task-tailored formats void of
extraneous detail. The patient data locker is linked to the public
132

knowledge store, and automatically updated to contain only
a subset of information related to the patient. Thus, an expert
need not develop their own intricate search queries and perform
the tedious task of progressively reducing the amount of irrelevant data returned by the query. Any query that can be run on
the entire knowledge network, can be run on the subgraph in
a patient’s locker, leading to a more precise subset of knowledge
returned, and potentially faster querying speeds as the search
space is reduced.
The expert analyst is provided with knowledge tailored to
a particular patient, partially automating the interpretation
process, and a process (BIT3 in ﬁgure 1) allows the analyst to
input new interpretation knowledge into the public network. We
envision this type of feedback mechanism will support the
inclusion of a learning model for our system, and allow the
community to contribute to its growth. The system is diverse,
providing framework and template libraries, allowing users to
integrate their own tools for analysis, data collection, and beyond.

CONCLUSION
A deluge of biomedical data generated from next-generation
sequencing (NGS) and clinical applications is overwhelming our
ability to efﬁciently extract value from it. Existing bioinformatics tools were not developed to support clinical translation
for an individual patient, causing an n¼1 translation bottleneck.
A new architecture for managing biomedical data is desired, and
we present the BioIntelligence Framework as a genomecompatible biomedical knowledge representation platform. Our
future efforts to achieve the goals outlined in this paper include
ensuring that we develop algorithms on this framework that
minimally meet the performance expectations of existing solutions in practice.

Abstract—This paper proposes a new algebraic system, Test
Algebra (T A), for identifying faults in combinatorial testing for
SaaS (Software-as-a-Service) applications. SaaS as a part of cloud
computing is a new software delivery model, and mission-critical
applications are composed, deployed, and executed in cloud
platforms. Testing SaaS applications is a challenging task because
new applications need to be tested when they are composed
before they can be deployed for execution. Combinatorial testing
algorithms can be used to identify faulty configurations and
interactions from 2-way all the way to k-way where k is the
number of components in the application. The T A defines rules
to identify faulty configurations and interactions. Using the rules
defined in the T A, a collection of configurations can be tested
concurrently in different servers and in any order and the results
obtained will be still same due to the algebraic constraints.
Index Terms—Combinatorial testing, algebra, SaaS

I. I NTRODUCTION
Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) is a new software delivery
model. SaaS often supports three features: customization,
multi-tenancy architecture (MTA), and scalability. MTA means
using one code base to develop multiple tenant applications,
and each tenant application essentially is a customization
of the base code [12]. A SaaS system often also supports
scalability as it can supply additional computing resources
when the workload is heavy. Tenants’ applications are often
customized by using components stored in the SaaS database
[14], [1], [11] including GUI, workflow, service, and data
components.
Once tenant applications are composed, they need to be tested, but a SaaS system can have millions of components, and
hundreds of thousands of tenant applications. Testing tenant
applications becomes a challenge as new tenant applications
and components are added into the SaaS system continuously.
New tenant applications are added on a daily basis while other
tenant applications are running on the SaaS platform. As new
tenant applications are composed, new components are added
into the SaaS system. Each tenant application represents a
customer for the SaaS system, and thus it needs to be tested.
Combinatorial testing is a popular testing technique to test
an application with different configurations. It often assumes
that each component within a configuration has been tested

already, but interactions among components in the configuration may cause failures. Traditional combinatorial testing
techniques often focus on test case generation to detect the
presence of faults, but fault location is an active research area.
Each configuration needs to be tested, as each configuration
represents a tenant application. Traditional combinatorial testing such as AETG [2] can reveal the existence of faults by
using few test cases to support t-way coverage for t ≥ 2. But
knowing the existence of a fault does not indicate which tway interactions are faulty. When the problem size is small,
an engineer can identify faults. However, when the problem
is large, it can be a challenge to identify faults.
As the IT industries moves to Big Data and cloud computing where hundreds of thousand processors are available,
potentially, a large number of processors with distributed
databases can be used to perform large-scale combinatorial testing. Furthermore, they also provide concurrent and
asynchronous computing mechanisms such as MapReduce,
automated redundancy and recovery management, automated
resource provisioning, and automated migration for scalability.
These capabilities provide significant computing power that
was not available before. One simple way of performing
combinatorial testing in a cloud environment is:
1) Partition the testing tasks;
2) Allocate these testing tasks to different processors in the
cloud platform for test execution;
3) Collect results done by these processors.
However, this is not efficient as while the number of computing
and storage resources have increased significantly, the number
of combinations to be considered is still too high. For example,
a large SaaS system may have millions of components, and
testing all of these combinations can still consume all the
resources in a cloud platform. Two ways to improve this
approach and both are based on learning from the previous
test results:
•

•

Devise a mechanism to merge test results from different
processors so that testing results can be merged quickly,
and detect any inconsistency in testing;
Based on the existing testing results, eliminate any con-

figurations or interactions from future testing.
Due to the asynchronous and autonomous nature of cloud
computing, test results may arrive asynchronously and autonomously, and this necessitates a new testing framework.
This paper proposes a new algebraic system, Test Algebra
(TA), to facilitate concurrent combinatorial testing. The key
feature of TA is that the algebraic rules follow the combinatorial structure, and thus can track the test results obtained. The
TA can then be used to determine whether a tenant application
is faulty, and which interactions need to be tested. The TA
is an algebraic system in which elements and operations are
formally defined. Each element represents a unique component
in the SaaS system, and a set of components represents a
tenant application. Assuming each component has been tested
by developers, testing a tenant application is equivalent to
ensuring that there is no t-way interaction faults for t ≥ 2
among the elements in a set.
The TA uses the principle that if a t-way interaction is
faulty, every (t + 1)-way interaction that contains the t-way
interaction as a subset is necessarily faulty. The TA provides
guidance for the testing process based on test results so far.
Each new test result may indicate if additional tests are needed
to test a specific configuration. The TA is an algebraic system,
primarily intended to track the test results without knowing
how these results were obtained. Specifically, it does not
record the execution sequence of previously executed test
cases. Because of this, it is possible to allocate different
configurations to different processors for execution in parallel
or in any order, and the test results are merged following
the TA rules. The execution order and the merge order do
not affect the merged results if the merging follows the TA
operation rules.
This paper is structured as follows: Section II discusses the
related work; Section III proposes TA and shows its details;
and Section IV concludes this paper. Appendix provides proofs
of TA associativity properties.
II. R ELATED W ORK
SaaS testing is a new research topic [14], [4], [10]. Using
policies and metadata, test cases can be generated to test
SaaS applications. Testing can be embedded in the cloud
platform where tenant applications are run [14]. Gao proposed
a framework for testing cloud applications [4], and proposed
a scalability measure for testing cloud application scalability.
Another scalability measure was proposed by [10].
Testing all combinations of inputs and preconditions is not
feasible, even with a simple product [6], [8]. The number
of defects in a software product can be large, and defects
occurring infrequently are difficult to find [15]. Combinatorial
test design is used to identify a small number of tests needed
to get the coverage of important combinations. Combinatorial
test design methods enable one to build structure variation
into test cases for having greater test coverage with fewer test
cases.
Determining the presence of faults caused by a small
number of interacting elements has been extensively studied

in component-based software testing. When interactions are
to be examined, testing involves a combination-based strategy
[5]. When every interaction among t or fewer elements is to
be tested, methods have been developed that provide pairwise
or t-way coverage. Among the early methods, AET G [2]
popularized greedy one-test-at-a-time methods for constructing
test suites. In the literature, the test suite is usually called a
covering array, defined as follows. Suppose that there are k
configurable elements, numbered from 1 to k. Suppose that
for element c, there are vc valid options. A t-way interaction
is a selection of t of the k configurable elements, and a valid
option for each. A test selects a valid option for every element,
and it covers a t-way interaction if, when one restricts the
attention to the t selected elements, each has the same option
in the interaction as it does in the test.
A covering array of strength t is a collection of tests so
that every t-way interaction is covered by at least one of the
tests. Covering arrays reveal faults that arise from improper
interaction of t or fewer elements [9]. There are numerous
computational and mathematical approaches for construction
of covering arrays with a number of tests as small as possible
[3], [7].
If a t-way interaction causes a fault, then executing all
tests of a covering array will reveal the presence of at least
one faulty interaction. SaaS testing is interested in identifying
those interactions that are faulty including their numbers and
locations, as faulty configurations cannot be used in tenant
applications. Furthermore, the number and location of faults
keep on changing as new components can be added into
the SaaS database continuously. By then executing each test,
certain interactions are known not to be faulty, while others
appear only in tests that reveal faults, and hence may be faulty.
At this point, a classification tree analysis builds decision trees
for characterizing possible sets of faults. This classification
analysis is then used either to permit a system developer to
focus on a small collection of possible faults, or to design
additional tests to further restrict the set of possible faults.
In [16], empirical results demonstrate the effectiveness of
this strategy at limiting the possible faulty interactions to a
manageable number. Assuming that interactions of more than
t elements do not produce faults, a covering array can use few
tests to certify that no fault arises from a t-way interaction.
The Adaptive Reasoning algorithm (AR) is a strategy to
detect faults in SaaS [13]. The algorithm uses earlier test
results to generate new test cases to detect faults in tenant
applications. It uses three principles:
•

•

•

Principle 1: When a tenant application (or configuration)
fails the testing, there is at least one fault (but there may
be more) in the tenant configuration.
Principle 2: When a tenant application passes the testing,
there is no fault in the tenant configuration resulting
from a t-way interactions among components in the
configuration.
Principle 3: Whenever a configuration contains one or
more faulty interactions, it is faulty.

III. T EST A LGEBRA
Let C be a finite set of components. A configuration is
a subset T ⊆ C. One is concerned with determining the
operational status of configurations. To do this, one can
execute certain tests; every test is a configuration, but there
may be restrictions on which configurations can be used as
tests. If a certain test can be executed, its execution results in
an outcome of passed (operational) or failed (faulty).
When a test execution yields result, all configurations that
are subsets of the test are operational. However, when a test
execution yields a faulty result, one only knows that at least
one subset causes the fault, but it is unclear which of these
subsets caused the failure. Among a set of configurations that
may be responsible for faults, the objective is to determine,
which cause faults and which do not. To do this, one must
identify the set of candidates to be faulty. Because faults
are expected to arise from an interaction among relatively
few components, one considers t-way interactions. The t-way
interactions are It = {U ⊆ C : |U | = t}. Hence the goal is to
select tests, so that from the execution results of these tests,
one can ascertain the status of all t-way interactions for some
fixed small value of t.
Because interactions and configurations are represented as
subsets, one can use set-theoretic operations such as union, and
their associated algebraic properties such as commutativity,
associativity, and self-absorption. The structure of subsets and
supersets also plays a key role.
To permit this classification, one can use a valuation function V , so that for every subset S of components, V (S)
indicates the current knowledge about the operational status
consistent with the components in S. The focus is on determining V (S) whenever S is an interaction in I1 ∪ · · · ∪ It .
These interactions can have one of five states.
• Infeasible (X): For certain interactions, it may happen
that no feasible test is permitted to contain this interaction. For example, it may be infeasible to select two GUI
components in one configuration such that one says the
wall is GREEN but the other says RED.
• Faulty (F): If the interaction has been found to be faulty.
• Operational (P): Among the rest, if an interaction has
appeared in a test whose execution gave an operational
result, the interaction cannot be faulty.
• Irrelevant (N): For some feasible interactions, it may
be the case that certain interactions are not expected to
arise, so while it is possible to run a test containing the
interaction, there is no requirement to do so.
• Unknown (U): If neither of these occurs then the status
of the interaction is required but not currently known.
Any given stage of testing, an interaction has one of five
possible status indicators. These five status indicators are
ordered by X  F  P  N  U under a relation , and
it has a natural interpretation to be explained in a moment.
A. Learning from Previous Test Results
The motivation for developing an algebra is to automate
the deduction of the status of an interaction from the status

of tests and other interactions, particularly in combining the
status of two interactions. Specifically, one is often interested
in determining V (T1 ∪ T2 ) from V (T1 ) and V (T2 ). To do this,
a binary operation ⊗ on {X, F, P, N, U} can be defined, with
operation table as follows:
⊗
X
F
P
N
U

X

U

Using this definition, one can verify that the binary operation ⊗ has the following properties of commutativity and
associativity.
V (T1 ) ⊗ V (T2 ) = V (T2 ) ⊗ V (T1 ),
V (T1 ) ⊗ (V (T2 ) ⊗ V (T3 )) = (V (T1 ) ⊗ V (T2 )) ⊗ V (T3 ).
Using this operation, one observes that V (T1 ∪ T2 ) 
V (T1 ) ⊗ V (T2 ). It follows that
1) Every superset of an infeasible interaction is infeasible.
2) Every superset of a failed interaction is failed or infeasible.
3) Every superset of an irrelevant interaction is irrelevant,
failed, passed, or infeasible.
A set S is an X-implicant if V (S) = X but whenever
S 0 ⊂ S, V (S 0 ) ≺ X. The X-implicants provide a compact
representation for all interactions that are infeasible. Indeed
for any interaction T that contains an X-implicant, V (T ) = X.
Furthermore, a set S is an F-implicant if V (S) = F but
whenever S 0 ⊂ S, V (S 0 ) ≺ F. For any interaction T that
contains an F-implicant, V (T )  F. In the same way, a set S is
an N-implicant if V (S) = N but whenever S 0 ⊂ S, V (S 0 ) = U.
For any interaction T that contains an N-implicant, V (T )  N.
An analogous statement holds for passed interactions, but here
the implication is for subsets. A set S is a P-implicant if
V (S) = P but whenever S 0 ⊃ S, V (S 0 )  F. For any
interaction T that is contained in a P-implicant, V (T ) = P.
Implicants are defined with respect to the current knowledge
about the status of interactions. When a t-way interaction is
known to be infeasible, failed, or irrelevant, it must contain
an X-, F-, or N-implicant. By repeatedly proceeding from tway to (t + 1)-way interactions, then, one avoids the need
for any tests for (t + 1)-way interactions that contain any
infeasible, failed, or irrelevant t-way interaction. Hence testing
typically proceeds by determining the status of the 1-way
interactions, then proceeding to 2-way, 3-way, and so on.
The operation ⊗ is useful in determining the implied status
of (t + 1)-way interactions from the computed results for
t-way interactions, by examining unions of the t-way and
smaller interactions and determining implications of the rule
that V (T1 ∪ T2 )  V (T1 ) ⊗ V (T2 ). Moreover, when adding
further interactions to consider, all interactions previously
tested that passed are contained in a P-implicant, and every
(t + 1) interaction contained in one of these interactions can
be assigned status P.

For example, V (a, b) = P, V (a, e) = X, and other 2way interactions exist as atomic interaction in TA. Based
on the defined ⊗ operation, values of t-way interactions can
be deduced from the atomic interactions and their contained
interactions, such as V (a, b, e)  V (a, b) ⊗ V (a, e) = X, i.e.
V (a, b, e) = X.
The 3-way interaction (a, b, c) can have inferred results from
2-way interactions (a, b), (a, c), (b, c). If any contained 2-way
interaction has value F, the determining value of 3-way is F,
without further testing needed. But if all values of contained
2-way interactions are P, (a, b, c) the interaction needs to be
tested. In this case, U needs to be changed to non-U such as F
or P, assuming the 3-way is not X or N.
B. Changing Test Result Status
When testing a configuration with n components, one
should test individual components, 2-way interactions, 3-way
interactions, all the way to n-way interactions. Since any
combination of interactions is relevant in this case, the status
of any interaction can be either X, F, P, or U. The status of a
configuration is determined by the status of all interactions.
1) If an interaction has status X (F), the configuration has
status X (F).
2) If all interactions have status P, the configuration has
status P.
3) If some interactions still have status U, further tests are
needed.
It is important to determine when an interaction with status
U can be deduced to have status F or P instead. It can never
obtain status X or N once having had status U.
To change U to P: An interaction is assigned status P if and
only if it is a subset of a test that leads to proper operation.
To change U to F: Consider the candidate T , one can
conclude that V (T ) = F if there is a test containing T that
yields a failed result, but for every other candidate interaction
T 0 that appears in this test, V (T 0 ) = P. In other words, the
only possible explanation for the failure is the failure of T .
C. Matrix Representation
Suppose that each individual component passed the testing.
Then the operation table starts from 2-way interactions, then
enlarges to t-way interactions step by step. During the procedure, many test results can be deduced from the existing results
following TA rules. For example, all possible configurations
of (a, b, c, d, e, f ) can be expressed in the form of matrix, or
operation table. First, we show the operation table for 2-way
interactions. The entries in the operation table are symmetric
and those on the main diagonal are not necessary. So only half
of the entries are shown.
As shown in Figure 1, 3-way interactions can be composed
by using 2-way interactions and components. Thus, following
the TA implication rules, the 3-way interactions operation table
is composed based on the results of 2-way combinations. Here,
(a, b, c, d, e, f ) has more 3-way interactions than 2-way
interactions. As seen in Figure 1, a 3-way interaction can be
obtained through different combinations of 2-way interactions

and components. For example, {a, b, c} = {a} ∪ {b, c} =
{b}∪{a, c} = {c}∪{a, b} = {a, b}∪{a, c} = {a, b}∪{b, c} =
{a, c} ∪ {b, c}. V (a) ⊗ V (b, c) = V (c) ⊗ V (a, b) = V (a, b) ⊗
V (b, c) = P⊗P = U. But V (b)⊗V (a, c) = V (a, b)⊗V (a, c) =
V (b, c) ⊗ V (a, c) = P ⊗ F = F. As TA defines the order of
the five status indicators, the result should be the value with

D. Merging Concurrent Testing Results
One way to achieve efficient testing is to allocate (overlapping or non-overlapping) tenant applications into different
clusters, and each cluster is sent to a different set of servers
for execution. Once each cluster completes its execution, the
test results can be merged. The testing results of a specific
interaction T in different servers should satisfy the following
constraints.
• If V (T ) = U in one cluster, then in other clusters, the
same V (T ) can be either F, P, N, or U.
• If V (T ) = N in one cluster, then in other clusters, the
same V (T ) can be either F, P, N, or U.
• If V (T ) = P in one cluster, then the same V (T ) can be
either P, N, or U in all clusters;
• If V (T ) = F in one cluster, then in other clusters, the
same V (T ) can be F, N, or U.
• If V (T ) = X in one cluster, then in other clusters, the
same V (T ) can be X only.
If these constraints are satisfied, then the testing results can
be merged. Otherwise, there must be an error in the testing
results. To represent this situation, a new status indicator, error
(E), is introduced and E  X. We define a binary operation ⊕
on {E, X, F, P, N, U}, with operation table as follows:
⊕

⊕ also has the properties of commutativity and associativity.
See Appendix for proof of associativity.
Using this operation, merging two testing results from two
different servers can be defined as Vmerged (T ) = Vcluster1 (T ) ⊕
Vcluster2 (T ). The merge can be performed in any order due to
the commutativity and associativity of ⊕, and if the constraints
of merge are satisfied and V (T ) = X, F, or P, the results cannot
be changed by any further testing or merging of test results
unless there are some errors in testing. If V (T ) = E, the testing

environment must be corrected and tests executed again after
fixing the error(s) in testing. For example, Vcluster1 (a, c, e) = X
and Vcluster2 (a, c, e) = F, so Vmerged (a, c, e) = X ⊕ F = E.
It means that there is something wrong with the tests of
interaction (a, c, e), and the problem must be fixed before
doing further testing.
Following the ⊕ associative rule, one can derive the following.
V1 (T ) ⊕ V2 (T ) ⊕ V3 (T )
= (V1 (T ) ⊕ V2 (T )) ⊕ V3 (T )
= V1 (T ) ⊕ (V2 (T ) ⊕ V3 (T ))
= V1 (T ) ⊕ V2 (T ) ⊕ V3 (T ) ⊕ V3 (T )
= (V1 (T ) ⊕ V2 (T )) ⊕ (V2 (T ) ⊕ V3 (T ))
= ((V1 (T ) ⊕ V2 (T )) ⊕ V2 (T )) ⊕ V3 (T )
= (V3 (T ) ⊕ V2 (T )) ⊕ (V3 (T ) ⊕ V1 (T ))
Thus the ⊕ rule allows one to partition the configurations
into different sets for different servers to run testing, and
these sets do not need to be non-overlapping. In conventional
cloud computing operations such as MapReduce, data should
not overlap, otherwise incorrect data may be produced. For
example, counting the items in a set can be performed by
MapReduce, but data allocated to different servers cannot
overlap, otherwise items may be counted more than once. In
TA, this is not a concern due to the nature of the TA operations

⊕. Once the results are available from each server, the testing
results can be merged either incrementally, in parallel, or in
any order. Furthermore, test results can be merged repeatedly
without changing the final results.
Using this approach, one can test say 10 batches of 100 tenant applications each, for a total of 1, 000 tenant applications.
Once this is done, another batch of 1, 000 tenant applications
can be tested with each 100 tenant application allocated to a
server for execution. In this way, after running 100 batches,
100, 000 tenant applications can be evaluated completely.
The following example illustrates the testing process of
fifteen configurations. According to the definition of configuration testing, all feasible interactions should be tested. For
simplicity, assume that only interaction (c, d, f ) is faulty, and
only interaction (c, d, e) is infeasible, and all other interactions
pass the testing. If one assigns configurations 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11,
13, 15 into Server1 , configurations 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14 into
Server2 , and 4-11 configurations into Server3 .
If Server1 and Server3 do their own testing first, Server2
can reuse test results of interactions from them to eliminate
interactions that need to be tested. For example, when testing
2-way interactions of configuration (b, c, d, f ) in Server2 ,
it can reuse the test results of (b, c), (b, d) of configuration
(b, c, d, e) from Server3 , (b, f ) of configuration (a, b, c, f )

from Server1 . They are all passed, and it can reuse the test
results of (b, c, d) of configuration (a, b, c, d) from Server1 ,
(b, c, f ) of configuration (a, b, c, f ) from Server1 , (b, d, f )
of configuration (a, b, d, f ) from Server1 , and (c, d, f ) of
configuration (a, c, d, f ) from Server3 . Because (c, d, f ) is
faulty, it can deduce that 4-way interaction (b, c, d, f ) is also
faulty. For the sets of configuration that are overlapping, their
returned test results from different servers are the same. The
merged results of these results also stay the same.
Not only interactions, sets of configurations, CS1 , CS2 ,
. . . , CSK can be allocated to different processors (or clusters)
for testing, and the test results can then be merged. The sets
can be non-overlapping or overlapping, and the merge process
can be arbitrary. For example, say the result of CSi is RCSi ,
the merge process can be (· · · ((((RCS1 + RCS2 ) + RCS3 ) +
RCS4 ) + · · · + RCSK ), or (· · · ((((RCSK + RCSk−1 ) +
RCSk−2 ) + · · · + RCS1 ), or any other sequence that includes
all RCSi , for i = 1 to K. This is true because RCS is simply
a set of V (Tj ) for any intercation Tj in the configuration CSi .

IV. C ONCLUSION
This paper proposes TA to address SaaS combinatorial
testing. The TA provides a foundation for concurrent combinatorial testing. The TA has two operations and test results
can have five states with a priority. By using the TA operations, many combinatorial tests can be eliminated as the
TA identifies those interactions that need not be tested. Also
the TA defines operation rules to merge test results done by
different processors, so that combinatorial tests can be done in
a concurrent manner. The TA rules ensure that either merged
results are consistent or a testing error has been detected so
that retest is needed. In this way, large-scale combinatorial
testing can be carried out in a cloud platform with a large
number of processors to perform test execution in parallel to
identify faulty interactions.

E. Modified Testing Process
Perform 2-way interaction testing first. Before going on to 3way interaction testing, use the results of 2-way testing to eliminate cases. The testing process stops when finishing testing all
t-way interactions. The analysis of t-way interactions is based
on the P T Rs of all (t − i)-way interactions for 1 ≤ i < t.
The superset of infeasible, irrelevant, and faulty test cases do
not need to be tested. The test results of the superset can be
obtained by TA operations and must be infeasible, irrelevant,
or faulty. But the superset of test cases with unknown indicator
must be tested. In this way, a large repeating testing workload
can be reduced.
For n components, all t-way interactions for t ≥ 2
are composed by 2-way, 3-way, ..., t-way interactions. In
n components combinatorial

A PPENDIX
The associativity of binary operation ⊗.
V (T1 ) ⊗ (V (T2 ) ⊗ V (T3 )) = (V (T1 ) ⊗ V (T2 )) ⊗ V (T3 ).
Proof: We will prove this property in the following cases.
(1) At least one of V (T1 ), V (T2 ), and V (T3 ) is X. Without
loss of generality, suppose that V (T1 ) = X, then according
to the operation table of ⊗, V (T1 ) ⊗ (V (T2 ) ⊗ V (T3 )) =
X ⊗ (V (T2 ) ⊗ V (T3 )) = X, (V (T1 ) ⊗ V (T2 )) ⊗ V (T3 ) =
(X ⊗ V (T2 )) ⊗ V (T3 ) = X ⊗ V (T3 ) = X. Thus, in this case,
V (T1 ) ⊗ (V (T2 ) ⊗ V (T3 )) = (V (T1 ) ⊗ V (T2 )) ⊗ V (T3 ).
(2) V (T1 ), V (T2 ), and V (T3 ) are not X and at least one
of V (T1 ), V (T2 ), and V (T3 ) is F. Without loss of generality,
suppose that V (T1 ) = F, then according to the operation table
of ⊗, the value of V (T2 ) ⊗ V (T3 ) can only be F, N or U.
So V (T1 ) ⊗ (V (T2 ) ⊗ V (T3 )) = F ⊗ (V (T2 ) ⊗ V (T3 )) = F,
(V (T1 ) ⊗ V (T2 )) ⊗ V (T3 ) = (F ⊗ V (T2 )) ⊗ V (T3 ) = F ⊗
V (T3 ) = F. Thus, in this case, V (T1 ) ⊗ (V (T2 ) ⊗ V (T3 )) =
(V (T1 ) ⊗ V (T2 )) ⊗ V (T3 ).
(3) V (T1 ), V (T2 ), and V (T3 ) are not X or F and at least one
of V (T1 ), V (T2 ), and V (T3 ) is N. Without loss of generality,
suppose that V (T1 ) = N, then according to the operation table
of ⊗, the value of V (T2 ) ⊗ V (T3 ) can only be N or U. So
V (T1 ) ⊗ (V (T2 ) ⊗ V (T3 )) = N ⊗ (V (T2 ) ⊗ V (T3 )) = N,
(V (T1 ) ⊗ V (T2 )) ⊗ V (T3 ) = (N ⊗ V (T2 )) ⊗ V (T3 ) = N ⊗
V (T3 ) = N. Thus, in this case, V (T1 ) ⊗ (V (T2 ) ⊗ V (T3 )) =
(V (T1 ) ⊗ V (T2 )) ⊗ V (T3 ).
(4) V (T1 ), V (T2 ), and V (T3 ) are not X, F or N. In this case,
V (T1 ), V (T2 ), and V (T3 ) can only be P or U. According to the
operation table of ⊗, the value of V (T1 )⊗V (T2 ) and V (T2 )⊗
V (T3 ) are U. So V (T1 ) ⊗ (V (T2 ) ⊗ V (T3 )) = V (T1 ) ⊗ U = U,
(V (T1 ) ⊗ V (T2 )) ⊗ V (T3 ) = U ⊗ V (T3 ) = U. Thus, in this
case, V (T1 ) ⊗ (V (T2 ) ⊗ V (T3 )) = (V (T1 ) ⊗ V (T2 )) ⊗ V (T3 ).
The associativity of binary operation ⊕.
V1 (T ) ⊕ (V2 (T ) ⊕ V3 (T )) = (V1 (T ) ⊕ V2 (T )) ⊕ V3 (T ).
Proof: We will prove this property in the following cases.
(1) One of V1 (T ), V2 (T ), and V3 (T ) is E. Without loss
of generality, suppose that V1 (T ) = E, then according to the
operation table of ⊕, V1 (T )⊕(V2 (T )⊕V3 (T )) = E⊗(V2 (T )⊕
V3 (T )) = E, (V1 (T ) ⊕ V2 (T )) ⊕ V3 (T ) = (E ⊕ V2 (T )) ⊕
V3 (T ) = E⊕V3 (T ) = E. Thus, in this case, V1 (T )⊕(V2 (T )⊕
V3 (T )) = (V1 (T ) ⊕ V2 (T )) ⊕ V3 (T ).

(2) V1 (T ), V2 (T ), and V3 (T ) are not E, and there is a pair
of V1 (T ), V2 (T ), and V3 (T ) does not satisfy the constrains.
Without loss of generality, suppose that V1 (T ) and V2 (T ) does
not satisfy the constrains, then according to the operation table
of ⊕, V1 (T ) ⊕ V2 (T ) = E. So (V1 (T ) ⊕ V2 (T )) ⊕ V3 (T ) =
E ⊕ V3 (T ) = E. Since V1 (T ) and V2 (T ) does not satisfy the
constrains, there can be two cases: (a) one of them is X and
the other is not, or (b) one of them is P and the other is F.
(a) If V1 (T ) = X, then V2 (T ) ⊕ V3 (T ) cannot be X because
V2 (T ) cannot be X. Thus, V1 (T ) ⊕ (V2 (T ) ⊕ V3 (T )) = E. If
V2 (T ) = X, then V2 (T ) ⊕ V3 (T ) 6= X can only be E or X.
Since V1 (T ) cannot be X, V1 (T ) ⊕ (V2 (T ) ⊕ V3 (T )) = E.
(b) If V1 (T ) = P and V2 (T ) = F, then V2 (T ) ⊕ V3 (T )
can only be E or F. Thus, V1 (T ) ⊕ (V2 (T ) ⊕ V3 (T )) = E. If
V1 (T ) = F and V2 (T ) = P, then V2 (T ) ⊕ V3 (T ) can only be
E or P. Thus, V1 (T ) ⊕ (V2 (T ) ⊕ V3 (T )) = E.
Thus, in this case, V1 (T ) ⊕ (V2 (T ) ⊕ V3 (T )) = (V1 (T ) ⊕
V2 (T )) ⊕ V3 (T ).
(3) V1 (T ), V2 (T ), and V3 (T ) are not E, and V1 (T ), V2 (T ),
and V3 (T ) satisfy the constrains.
(a) One of V1 (T ), V2 (T ), and V3 (T ) is X. Without loss of
generality, suppose that V1 (T ) = X, then V2 (T ) = V3 (T ) = X.
So V1 (T ) ⊕ (V2 (T ) ⊕ V3 (T )) = X ⊕ (X ⊕ X) = X ⊕ X = X and
(V1 (T ) ⊕ V2 (T )) ⊕ V3 (T ) = (X ⊕ X) ⊕ X = X ⊕ X = X.
(b) V1 (T ), V2 (T ), and V3 (T ) are not X, and one of V1 (T ),
V2 (T ), and V3 (T ) is F. Without loss of generality, suppose
that V1 (T ) = F, then V2 (T ) and V3 (T ) can only be F, N,
or U. According to operation table of ⊕, V2 (T ) ⊕ V3 (T ) can
only be F, N, or U, and V1 (T ) ⊕ V2 (T ) can only be F. So
V1 (T ) ⊕ (V2 (T ) ⊕ V3 (T )) = F ⊕ (V2 (T ) ⊕ V3 (T )) = F and
(V1 (T ) ⊕ V2 (T )) ⊕ V3 (T ) = F ⊕ V3 (T ) = F.
(c) V1 (T ), V2 (T ), and V3 (T ) are not X or F, and one of
V1 (T ), V2 (T ), and V3 (T ) is P. Without loss of generality,
suppose that V1 (T ) = P, then V2 (T ) and V3 (T ) can only be
P, N, or U. According to operation table of ⊕, V2 (T ) ⊕ V3 (T )
can only be P, N, or U, and V1 (T ) ⊕ V2 (T ) can only be F. So
V1 (T ) ⊕ (V2 (T ) ⊕ V3 (T )) = P ⊕ (V2 (T ) ⊕ V3 (T )) = P and
(V1 (T ) ⊕ V2 (T )) ⊕ V3 (T ) = P ⊕ V3 (T ) = P.
(d) V1 (T ), V2 (T ), and V3 (T ) are not X, F or P, and one
of V1 (T ), V2 (T ), and V3 (T ) is U. Without loss of generality,
suppose that V1 (T ) = U, then V2 (T ) and V3 (T ) can only be
N, or U. According to operation table of ⊕, V2 (T ) ⊕ V3 (T )
can only be N, or U, and V1 (T ) ⊕ V2 (T ) can only be U. So
V1 (T ) ⊕ (V2 (T ) ⊕ V3 (T )) = U ⊕ (V2 (T ) ⊕ V3 (T )) = U and
(V1 (T ) ⊕ V2 (T )) ⊕ V3 (T ) = U ⊕ V3 (T ) = U.
(e) V1 (T ), V2 (T ), and V3 (T ) are N. V1 (T ) ⊕ (V2 (T ) ⊕
V3 (T )) = N ⊕ (N ⊕ N) = N ⊕ N = N and (V1 (T ) ⊕ V2 (T )) ⊕
V3 (T ) = (N ⊕ N) ⊕ N = N ⊕ N = N.
Thus, in this case, V1 (T ) ⊕ (V2 (T ) ⊕ V3 (T )) = (V1 (T ) ⊕
V2 (T )) ⊕ V3 (T ).

When a v-set can be equipped with a set of k-subsets so that
every 2-subset of the v-set appears in exactly (or at most, or
at least) one of the chosen k-subsets, the result is a balanced
incomplete block design (or packing, or covering, respectively).
For each k, balanced incomplete block designs are known to exist
for all suﬃciently large values of v that meet certain divisibility
conditions. When these conditions are not met, one can ask for
the packing with the most blocks and/or the covering with the
fewest blocks. Elementary necessary conditions furnish an upper
bound on the number of blocks in a packing and a lower bound
on the number of blocks in a covering. In this paper it is shown
that for all suﬃciently large values of v, a packing and a covering
on v elements exist whose numbers of blocks differ from the basic
bounds by no more than an additive constant depending only on k.

of V appears in at least λ blocks. When λ = 1, the simpler notation of t-packing or t-covering is used.
When ( V , B ) is both a (t , λ)-packing and a (t , λ)-covering with blocksize k, it is a t-( v , k, λ) design.
 v  k
A t-( v , k, λ) design, if one exists, has λ t / t blocks. When the required number of blocks is
not integral, no such design can exist. Selecting all blocks containing a particular element x ∈ V and
deleting x from each forms the derived (t − 1)-( v − 1, k − 1, λ) design (with respect to x). For a design
 v −i  k−i 
to exist, evidently the derived design must exist; hence for a t-( v , k, λ) design to exist, λ t −i / t −i
must be integral for every 0  i  t. When these conditions are not all met, one can ask instead for
the largest (t , λ)-packing, or for the smallest (t , λ)-covering, of order v and blocksize k. The Johnson
bound [13] states that such a packing can have no more than

blocks. Our main result is that when t = 2 and λ = 1, there exist packings and coverings whose
sizes are within a constant of these bounds. Determining when these bounds are met exactly is a
challenging question.
In 1963, Erdős and Hanani [9] conjectured that, for ﬁxed k and t, with all blocks of size k,
n k
a t-packing on n elements with
/ t (1 − o(1)) blocks and a t-covering on n elements with
t

n k
/ t (1 + o(1)) blocks both exist. This was proved by Rödl [20], and has spawned a large literature
t
(for example, [10,11,14,15,23]). However, even when t = 2, all of these general constructions deviate

from the Johnson and Schönheim bounds by an amount that grows as a function of the number of
elements. Wilson [25] established that the necessary divisibility conditions for a 2-( v , k, λ) design to
exist are asymptotically suﬃcient (i.e., for ﬁxed k and λ, and suﬃciently large v). This provides a
different means to establish the Erdős–Hanani conjecture for t = 2, but also does not immediately
imply that one can ﬁnd packings or coverings whose sizes are within a constant of the optimal sizes.
Wilson [24] earlier considered this more challenging problem for packings, but the solution for the
analogous problem for coverings has remained elusive.
We focus on the case when t = 2 and λ = 1 here. Caro and Yuster state stronger results for covering [3] and packing [2] than we prove here. Their approach relies in an essential manner on a strong
statement by Gustavsson [12]:
Proposition 1.1. Let H be a graph with ν vertices and h edges, having degree sequence (d1 , . . . , dν ). Then
there exist a constant N H and a constant  H > 0, both depending only on H , such that for all n > N H , if
G is a graph on n vertices, m edges, and degree sequence (δ1 , . . . , δn ) so that min(δ1 , . . . , δn )  n(1 −  H ),
gcd(d1 , . . . , dν ) | gcd(δ1 , . . . , δn ), and h | m, then G has an edge partition (decomposition) into graphs isomorphic to H .
We have not been able to verify the proof of Proposition 1.1. Indeed, while the result has been
used a number of times in the literature, no satisfactory proof of it appears there. While we expect
that the statement is true, we do not think that the proof in [12] is suﬃcient at this time to employ
the statement as a foundation for further results. Therefore we adopt a strategy that is completely
independent of Proposition 1.1, and independent of the results built on it.
In the remainder of the paper, we ﬁrst recall relevant known results. Then in Section 3, we determine the possible structure of optimal packings and coverings, in order to determine what can remain
uncovered in a packing, and what must be covered more than once in a covering. This is done in general for packings and coverings with a single hole, in order to limit any deviation from the desired
bound to the manner in which a (ﬁxed size) hole is ﬁlled. In Section 4, the most important part of
the proof is established, namely that in each congruence class, one ﬁnite example can be produced.
Finally in Section 5, these single examples are shown to form the required ingredients to establish
asymptotic existence.

2. Background
To proceed more formally, we require a number of deﬁnitions and preliminary results from combinatorial design theory; related background material can be found in [1,22]. A balanced incomplete block
design (BIBD) is a 2-( v , k, λ) design. Balanced incomplete block designs have been extensively studied
because of their central role in numerous applications in experimental design, coding and information
theory, communications, and connections with fundamental topics in algebra, ﬁnite geometry, number theory, and combinatorics (see [5,7] for examples). The general divisibility conditions (stated for
v 

k 
general t earlier) require that λ 2 ≡ 0 mod 2 and λ( v − 1) ≡ 0 (mod k − 1).
A group divisible design ( V , G , B ) is a ﬁnite set V of elements or points; a partition G = {G 1 , . . . , G s }
of V (groups); and a set B of subsets of V (blocks), with the property that every 2-subset of V lying
within a group appears in no block, while every 2-subset of V with elements from different groups
appears in exactly λ blocks. When K is a set of positive integers for which | B | ∈ K whenever B ∈ B ,
the design is a ( K , λ)-GDD. When λ = 1, we write simply K -GDD. Its order is | V |, its index is λ, and
u
u
its type is σ1 1 · · · σ  when the multiset of group sizes {|G i |: 1  i  s} is the same as the multiset
formed by including u j copies of σ j when σ j = 0, for all 1  j  . We write (k, λ)-GDD (or k-GDD
when λ = 1) when K = {k}. A transversal design TDλ (k, n) is a (k, λ)-GDD of type nk . We write TD(k, n)
when λ = 1. A transversal design is idempotent if its element set is {1, . . . , k} × {1, . . . , n}, and its block
set contains {{(i , j ): 1  i  k}: 1  j  n}. A pairwise balanced design with blocksizes K and order v
(( K , λ)-PBD of order v) is a ( K , λ)-GDD of type 1 v ; we write K -PBD when λ = 1. Then a balanced
incomplete block design ((k, λ)-BIBD) is a (k, λ)-PBD; we write k-BIBD when λ = 1.
An incomplete pairwise balanced design of order v with holesize h, blocksizes K , and index λ is a
triple ( V , H , B ) for which | V | = v, | H | = h, H ⊆ V , B contains a set of subsets of V for which | B | ∈ K
whenever B ∈ B , and for every pair of distinct elements x, y ∈ V , the number of blocks in {{x, y } ⊂
B ∈ B } is 0 if {x, y } ⊆ H and λ otherwise. The notation ( K , λ)-IPBD( v , h) is used; we may omit λ
when it is 1, and write k instead of K when K = {k}.
Let K be a set of positive integers, each at least 2. Then deﬁne α ( K ) = gcd{k − 1: k ∈ K } and
 
	
β( K ) = gcd 2k : k ∈ K .
Wilson establishes a crucial asymptotic existence result:
Theorem 2.1. (See [25].) Let K be a set of integers,each
 at least 2. Let λ be a positive integer. For all suﬃciently
n
large n satisfying λ(n − 1) ≡ 0 (mod α ( K )) and λ 2 ≡ 0 (mod β( K )), there exists a ( K , λ)-PBD of order n. In
particular for K = {k}, when λ(n − 1) ≡ 0 (mod k − 1), λ
exists a (k, λ)-BIBD of order n.

Colbourn and Rödl prove a variant that we use:

there
is
a K -PBD of order v in which, for each 1  i  m, the fraction of pairs appearing

in blocks having size ki is in the range [ p i − ε , p i + ε ].
A stronger version of Theorem 2.2 is given in [26], and a variant for resolvable designs appears
in [8].
Perhaps the most powerful generalization of Theorem 2.1 is due to Lamken and Wilson [16]. We in(r ,λ)
be a complete digraph on n vertices with exactly λ edges of color i joining
troduce this next. Let K n
(r ,λ)
is
any vertex x to any vertex y for every color i in a set of r colors. A family F of subgraphs of K n
(r ,λ)
(r ,λ)
if every edge e ∈ E ( K n ) belongs to exactly one member in F . Given a fama decomposition of K n
(r ,λ)
is a decomposition F such that every
ily Φ of edge-r-colored digraphs, a Φ -decomposition of K n
graph F ∈ F is isomorphic to some graph G ∈ Φ . For a vertex x of an edge-r-colored digraph G, the
degree-vector of x is the 2r-vector d(x) = (in1 (x), out1 (x), in2 (x), out2 (x), . . . , inr (x), outr (x)), where
in j (x) and out j (x) denote the indegree and outdegree of vertex x in the spanning subgraph of G by

edges of color j, respectively, for 1  j  r. We denote by α (G ) the greatest common divisor of the
integers t such that the 2r-vector (t , t , . . . , t ) is an integral linear combination of the vectors d(x) as
x ranges over the vertex set V (G ) of G. Equivalently, α (G ) is the smallest positive integer t 0 such
that (t 0 , t 0 , . . . , t 0 ) is an integral linear combination of the vectors {d(x)}. Let Φ be a family of simple
edge-r-colored digraphs and let α (Φ) denote the greatest common divisor of the integers t such that
the 2r-vector (t , t , . . . , t ) is an integral linear combination of the vectors {d(x)} as x ranges over all
vertices of all graphs in Φ . For each graph G ∈ Φ , let μ(G ) = (m1 , m2 , . . . , mr ), where mi is the number of edges of color i in G. We denote by β(Φ) the greatest common divisor of the integers m such
that (m, m, . . . , m) is an integral linear combination of the vectors {μ(G ): G ∈ Φ}. Equivalently, β(Φ)
is the smallest positive integer m0 such that (m0 , m0 , . . . , m0 ) is an integral linear combination of the
(r ,λ)
vectors {μ(G )}. A graph G 0 ∈ Φ is useless when it cannot occur in any Φ -decomposition of K n .
Φ is admissible when no member of Φ is useless.
Theorem 2.3. (See [16].) Let Φ be an admissible family of simple edge-r-colored digraphs. For all suﬃciently
(r ,λ)
large n satisfying λ(n − 1) ≡ 0 (mod α (Φ)) and λn(n − 1) ≡ 0 (mod β(Φ)), a Φ -decomposition of K n
exists.
Theorem 2.3 has numerous consequences for the existence of various classes of combinatorial
designs. Building on Theorem 2.3, Liu establishes the following:
Theorem 2.4. (See [17].) Let K be a set of integers, each at least 2.
nLet m and λ be positive integers. For all
suﬃciently large n satisfying λm(n − 1) ≡ 0 (mod α ( K )) and λm2 2 ≡ 0 (mod β( K )), there exists a ( K , λ)GDD of order mn .
Mohácsy and Ray-Chaudhuri prove a result for a ﬁxed number of groups when the index is 1.
Theorem 2.5. (See [18,19].) Let k and u be integers with u  k  2. For all suﬃciently large m satisfying
m(u − 1) ≡ 0 (mod k − 1) and m2 u (u − 1) ≡ 0 (mod k(k − 1)), there exists a k-GDD of type mu .
This subsumes a classical result of Chowla, Erdős, and Straus:
Theorem 2.6. (See [4].) Let k  2 be an integer. For all suﬃciently large m, there exists a TD(k, m).
3. Packings, coverings, and the optima
We use known asymptotic existence results to treat asymptotic existence of packings and coverings
in the cases that a k-BIBD does not exist. We require further deﬁnitions, to extend packings and
coverings to have a ‘hole’.
A packing with blocksize k with a hole ( V , H , B ) is a set V of elements, a subset (hole) H ⊂ V , and
 H , there is at most one B ∈ B with
a set B of k-subsets of V , so that for every {x, y } ⊂ V , {x, y } ⊂
{x, y } ⊂ B; when {x, y } ⊂ H , there is no block B ∈ B with {x, y } ⊂ B. The leave Γ of ( V , B ) is a graph
with vertex set V ; pair {x, y } appears as an edge if and only if {x, y }  H and is not a subset of any
block of B .
A covering with blocksize k with a hole ( V , H , B ) is a set V of elements, a subset H ⊂ V , and a set B
of k-subsets of V , so that for every {x, y } ⊂ V , {x, y } ⊂ H , there is at least one B ∈ B with {x, y } ⊂ B.
The excess Γ of ( V , B ) is a multigraph with vertex set V ; the number of times pair {x, y } appears
as an edge is exactly λxy when {x, y } ⊂ H , and λxy − 1 otherwise, where λxy is the number of blocks
of B that contain {x, y }.
A packing with blocksize k ( V , B ) is a packing with blocksize k with a hole ( V , ∅, B ), and a covering
with blocksize k ( V , B ) is a covering with blocksize k with a hole ( V , ∅, B ). A maximum packing with
blocksize k is a packing with blocksize k ( V , B ) with the most blocks among all packings with blocksize k on | V | elements; equivalently, its leave has the fewest edges. A minimum covering with blocksize

1444

Y.M. Chee et al. / Journal of Combinatorial Theory, Series A 120 (2013) 1440–1449

k is a covering with blocksize k ( V , B ) with fewest blocks among all coverings with blocksize k on | V |
elements; equivalently, its excess has the fewest edges.
Suppose that ( V , H , B ) is a packing with blocksize k with a hole, with v = | V |, h = | H |, and
n = | V \ H |. Let x be a vertex in V \ H . The number of pairs on V that contain x is congruent to v − 1
modulo k − 1. The number containing x that appear in blocks of B is congruent to 0 modulo k − 1.
Hence x has degree congruent to v − 1 modulo k − 1 in the leave. When the hole is nonempty,
elements in the hole have degrees congruent to n modulo k − 1 in the leave. By the same token, in
the excess of a covering with blocksize k with a hole, x has degree congruent to −( v − 1) modulo
k − 1; elements in the hole have degrees congruent to −n modulo k − 1.
We employ speciﬁc types of packings and coverings with holes in which the leave or excess has
all vertices in the hole of degree 0. For an integer n ≡ 0 (mod k(k − 1)) and an integer h  1, let
δ ≡ h − 1 (mod k − 1) and 
 ≡ −(h − 1) (mod k − 1) with 0  δ, 
 < k − 1. Then an optimum packing
with blocksize k with a hole, k-OP(n + h, h), is a packing with blocksize k on n + h elements whose
leave has degree δ on each vertex not in the hole, and 0 on each vertex in the hole; and an optimum
covering with blocksize k with a hole, k-OC(n + h, h), is a covering with blocksize k on n + h elements
whose excess has degree 
 on each vertex not in the hole, and 0 on each vertex in the hole. When
h ≡ 1 (mod k − 1), δ = 
 = 0. In this case, a k-OP( v , h) and a k-OC( v , h) are the same, and are
equivalent to a k-IPBD( v , h).
In any packing with blocksize k on v = n + h elements with n ≡ 0 (mod k(k − 1)), no vertex
can have degree smaller than δ in the leave; and in any covering with blocksize k on v = n + h
elements with n ≡ 0 (mod k(k − 1)), no vertex can have degree smaller than 
 in the excess. Indeed,
choosing  and Λ so that   v − 1  Λ; , Λ ≡ v − 1 (mod k − 1); Λ −  < k − 1; and  = Λ when
v

blocks, while every covering with blocksize k on v elements contains at least L v ,k = k(Λ
blocks.
k−1)
Then  v ,k is at least the Johnson bound, and Λ v ,k is at most the Schönheim bound.
The purpose of this paper is to prove the following two results.

Theorem 3.1. There is a constant pk such that for all v  k, the number of blocks in a maximum packing with
blocksize k on v elements is at least  v ,k − pk and at most  v ,k .
Theorem 3.2. There is a constant ak such that for all v  k, the number of blocks in a minimum covering with
blocksize k on v elements is at least L v ,k and at most L v ,k + ak .
We establish these results in a number of steps. Treating an arbitrary but ﬁxed value of k, in
Section 4, we show that for every c satisfying 0  c < k(k − 1), there exist positive integers nc ≡
0 (mod k(k − 1)) and hc ≡ c (mod k(k − 1)) so that a k-OP(nc + hc , hc ) exists; we also show that
for every c satisfying 0  c < k(k − 1), there exist positive integers mc ≡ 0 (mod k(k − 1)) and c ≡
c (mod k(k − 1)) so that a k-OC(mc + c , c ) exists. This provides a single example for optimal packings
and coverings with a hole in every congruence class modulo k(k − 1). In Section 5, we use these
results to establish that there exist integers κk and uk , depending only on k, so that whenever v  κk ,
there exists an h  uk for which a k-OP( v , h) exists, and there also exists an   uk for which a
k-OC( v , ) exists. From this, because uk is ﬁxed and independent of v, we establish Theorems 3.1
and 3.2 by ﬁlling the holes. The crucial step, particularly for coverings, is producing one example in
each congruence class. We treat this next.
4. One example in each congruence class
In the case when h ≡ 1 (mod k − 1), a k-OP( v , h) and a k-OC( v , h) coincide with a k-IPBD( v , h),
so we treat this situation ﬁrst; subsequently the packing and covering cases differ.
4.1. Packing and covering: v ≡ 1 (mod k − 1)
An incomplete transversal design ITD(k, n + φ; φ) is a set V of k(n + φ) elements, of which kφ form
a hole H . The elements are partitioned into k groups G 1 , . . . , G k so that |G i ∩ H | = φ for 1  i  k.

Y.M. Chee et al. / Journal of Combinatorial Theory, Series A 120 (2013) 1440–1449

1445

This set is equipped with a set of k-subsets (blocks) with the property that every pair of elements
that appears in a group or appears in the hole H appears in no block, and every other pair appears
in exactly one block.
Lemma 4.1. Let k  2 be an integer. Let 0  φ  k. For all suﬃciently large n, an ITD(k, n + φ; φ) exists.
Proof. Using Theorem 2.6, choose ω so that a TD(k + 1, ω), a TD(k + 1, ω + 1), a TD(k + 1, ω + 2),
and a TD(k + 1, ω + 3) all exist. Delete one group in each to form an idempotent TD(k, v ) for each
v ∈ {ω, ω + 1, ω + 2, ω + 3}. For n suﬃciently large, there is an {ω + 1, ω + 2, ω + 3}-PBD of order
n + ω + 1 containing a block of size ω + 1 by Theorem 2.2. (Because α ({ω + 1, ω + 2, ω + 3}) = 1 and
β({ω + 1, ω + 2, ω + 3}) = 1, this follows by choosing 0 < ε < 14 and choosing the fraction of pairs
in blocks of size ω + 1 to be 2ε .) Delete all but φ elements from a block of size ω + 1, and remove
the block of size φ making a hole, to form an {ω, ω + 1, ω + 2, ω + 3}-IPBD(n + φ, φ). Give every
element weight k, and use the idempotent TDs to inﬂate all blocks. The kφ elements arising from the
φ elements of hole in the IPBD form the hole of the ITD. 2
Lemma 4.2. Let h be an integer for which h ≡ 1 (mod k − 1) and k  h  k(k − 1) + 1. Then there exist
inﬁnitely many integers γ for which a k-IPBD(γ k(k − 1) + h, h) exists.

. Choose γ so that a k-BIBD of order γ (k − 1) + k and an ITD(k, γ (k − 1) + φ; φ)
Proof. Let φ = kh−
1
both exist. (Use Lemma 4.1 for the existence of the ITD.) Start with the ITD on the elements of V
having a hole on the elements in H ⊂ V . Add k − φ new elements N ∞ . For 1  i  k, let N i consist of
the φ elements in the ith group of the ITD that appear in H . Place on the elements of the ith group,
together with N ∞ , the blocks of a copy of the k-BIBD, omitting a block on the elements of N i ∪ N ∞ .
On the γ k(k − 1) + φ(k − 1) + k = γ k(k − 1) + h elements of V ∪ N ∞ , all pairs are covered except
k
those within the hole on elements N ∞ ∪ i =1 N i of size h = φ(k − 1) + k. 2

Corollary 4.3. Whenever c ≡ 1 (mod k − 1) and 0  c < k(k − 1), there are inﬁnitely many integers nc and hc
with nc ≡ 0 (mod k(k − 1)) and hc ≡ c (mod k(k − 1)) so that a k-OP(nc + hc , hc ) exists.
Proof. Set hc = c if c  k, and hc = k(k − 1) + 1 if c = 1. Apply Lemma 4.2 with h = hc , and set
nc = γ k(k − 1). 2
The same argument establishes:
Corollary 4.4. Whenever c ≡ 1 (mod k − 1) and 0  c < k(k − 1), there are inﬁnitely many integers mc and c
with mc ≡ 0 (mod k(k − 1)) and c ≡ c (mod k(k − 1)) so that a k-OC(mc + c , c ) exists.
4.2. Packing: v ≡ 1 (mod k − 1)
Lemma 4.5. For every integer c satisfying 0  c < k(k − 1), there exist an nc ≡ 0 (mod k(k − 1)) and an
hc ≡ c (mod k(k − 1)) for which a k-OP(nc + hc , hc ) exists.
Proof. When c > 0, write c = s(k − 1) + d with 1  d < k. When c = 0, set s = d = k − 1. If d = 1,
apply Lemma 4.3. Otherwise choose α ≡ 1 (mod k(k − 1)) and N > α so that
N ≡ α (mod k − 1);
a k-GDD of type dα exists (Theorem 2.4);
an α -BIBD of order N exists (Theorem 2.1); and
an ITD(k, d( N − α ) + s, s) exists (Lemma 4.1).
Treat the α -BIBD as an α -GDD of type 1 N −α α 1 by removing a block, and inﬂate using the kGDD of type dα to form a k-GDD of type d N −α (dα )1 . Adjoin dα − s inﬁnite elements to the

1446

Y.M. Chee et al. / Journal of Combinatorial Theory, Series A 120 (2013) 1440–1449

ITD(k, d( N − α ) + s, s). On each group together with the inﬁnite elements, place a copy of the kGDD of type d N −α (dα )1 , aligning the group of size dα on the s elements in the intersection of
the group and the hole of the ITD, together with the dα − s inﬁnite elements. The result is a kGDD of type dk( N −α ) (dα + s(k − 1))1 . Treat this as a packing. On the dk( N − α ) points not in the
large hole, the leave has degree d − 1, so the result is a k-OP(nc + hc , hc ) with nc = dk( N − α ) and
hc = dα + s(k − 1). Because dk ≡ 0 (mod k) and N − α ≡ 0 (mod k − 1), nc ≡ 0 (mod k(k − 1)). Because
dα ≡ d (mod k(k − 1)), hc ≡ c (mod k(k − 1)). 2
4.3. Covering: v ≡ 1 (mod k − 1)
We employ some further, more specialized, combinatorial objects to treat coverings for the remaining congruence classes.
Let V be a set of elements; B be a set of k-subsets of V ; G = {G 1 , . . . , G r } be a partition of V ,
and H = { H 1 , . . . , H t } be a partition of V . Suppose that |G i ∩ H j | = μ for all 1  i  r, 1  j  t.

is exactly one B ∈ B with {x, y } ⊂ B, but not both. Then ( V , G , H, B ) is a double group divisible design
with blocksize k (k-DGDD) of type (μr )t . A holey transversal design with blocksize k (k-HTD) of type μr
is a k-DGDD of type (μr )k .

Theorem 4.6. Let k  2 be an integer. For all suﬃciently large r, there exists a k-HTD of type 2r .
Proof. Choose K = {x1 , . . . , xs } so that α ( K ) = β( K ) = 1, and so that for each 1  i  s, xi is large
enough to ensure that Theorem 2.6 yields a TD(k + 1, xi ). Remove one group (and rename elements
as needed) to form an idempotent TD(k, xi ). When r is large enough, Theorem 2.4 yields a K -GDD
( V , G , B ) of type 2r with groups G = {G 1 , . . . , G r }. The elements of the k-HTD to be formed are
V × {0, . . . , k − 1}. For each block B ∈ B , on the elements B × {0, . . . , k − 1}, align the k groups on
{ B × {i }: 0  i < k} to place the blocks of an idempotent TD(k, | B |). In the resulting design, one set of
groups is formed by V × {i } for 0  i < k, the other by G j × {0, . . . , k − 1} for 1  j  r. 2

and 2 ≡ 0 mod 2 , there exists a k-DGDD of type (2r )t .
Proof. Apply Theorem 2.1 to form a k-BIBD ( V , B ) with t elements. Apply Theorem 4.6 to form a
k-HTD of type 2r . To form the k-DGDD, use elements V × {a, b} × {1, . . . , r }. For every B ∈ B , place a
copy of the HTD on B × {a, b} × {1, . . . , r }, aligning groups of size 2k on B × {a, b} × {i } for 1  i  r,
and groups of size 2r on {x} × {a, b} × {1, . . . , r } for x ∈ B. 2
The key construction follows:
Theorem 4.8. Let t , r , y be positive integers so that r ≡ 0 (mod k(k − 1)), t ≡ 1 (mod k(k − 1)), and y ≡
2 (mod k − 1). Suppose that there exist
(1) a k-DGDD of type (2r )t ;
(2) a k-BIBD on 2t + k − 2 elements;
(3) a k-OC(2r + y , y ).
Then there is a k-OC(2rt + k − 2 + y , 2r + y + k − 2).
Proof. Let V = {ai , j , b i , j : 1  i  r , 1  j  t } be the elements of the k-DGDD, with groups aligned
so that G i = {ai , j , b i , j : 1  j  t } and H j = {ai , j , b i , j : 1  i  r }. Let B be its set of blocks. Adjoin a
set C of k − 2 new elements. For 1  i  r, on C ∪ G i , form a k-BIBD on 2t + k − 2 elements, aligning
a block on C ∪ {ait , b it }; then delete that block, and call the resulting set of blocks Di . Adjoin a set R

with y further new elements. For 1  j < t, on R ∪ H j place a k-OC(2r + y , y ) with the hole aligned
on R, whose block set is E j .
r
We consider the design on the 2rt + k − 2 + y elements V ∪ R ∪ C with block set B ∪ i =1 Di ∪

t −1

j =1 E j . All blocks have size k because each ingredient contains only blocks of size k. First we show
that the design is a covering with a hole on R ∪ C ∪ H t . Two elements in the hole do not appear
together in a block. An element from G i ∩ H j with j < t appears in a block with each element
of C ∪ (G i ∩ H t ) in Di ; it appears in a block with each element of R in E j ; and it appears with
each element of H t \ G i in a block of B . Consider two distinct elements x ∈ G i ∩ H j and y ∈ G m ∩ H n
with j , n < t. If i = m and j = n, then {x, y } = {ai , j , b i , j } appears in a block of Di (and also in at least
one block of E j ). If i = m and j = n, then {x, y } appears in at least one block of E j . If i = m and j = n,
then {x, y } appears in one block of Di . If i = m and j = n, then {x, y } appears in one block of B .
Hence the design is a covering with a hole on R ∪ C ∪ H t .
Secondly, we establish that it has the correct excess degrees to be an optimal covering with a
hole, a k-OC. The design has 2rt + k − 2 + y elements. Because r ≡ 0 (mod k − 1), the number of
elements satisﬁes 2rt + k − 2 + y ≡ y − 1 (mod k − 1). The hole has 2r + k − 2 + y elements. Because
r ≡ 0 (mod k − 1), the number of elements in the hole satisﬁes 2r + k − 2 + y ≡ y − 1 (mod k − 1).
Let y ≡ −( y − 1) (mod k − 1) with 0  y < k − 1. We must show that every element not in the
hole has degree y + 1 in the excess, and every element in the hole has degree 0 in the excess.
We treat elements in the hole ﬁrst. Each element of C appears only in blocks {Di : 1  i  r }. It
appears in r (t − 1) pairs to be covered, and appears in r (t − 1)/(k − 1) blocks, with (t − 1)/(k − 1)
blocks arising in each of {Di : 1  i  r } because this was constructed from a BIBD. Each element
of R appears only in blocks {E j : 1  j < t }. Because elements of R have excess degree 0 in the kOC(2r + y , y ) forming E j , they have excess degree 0 in the union. Each element of H t appears only
in blocks of B , and has excess degree 0. Now consider an element x ∈ G i ∩ H j , with j = t so that x
is not in the hole. Then x appears in elements of B , Di and E j . It appears in 2(r − 1)(t − 1)/(k − 1)
blocks of B , because it arises from the DGDD. It appears in (2t + k − 3)/(k − 1) blocks of Di , because
it arises from a BIBD. Now in E j , x is not in the hole of the k-OC(2r + y , y ), and hence it arises
1
(2rt + k − 2 + y + y ) blocks, and
in (2r − 1 + y + y )/(k − 1) blocks. So in total x appears in k−
1
because it appears in (2rt + k − 2 + y ) − 1 pairs, its excess degree is y + 1.
Because 2r + y + k − 2 ≡ y − 1 (mod k − 1) and y ≡ 2 (mod k − 1), the result is the k-OC(2rt +
k − 2 + y , 2r + y + k − 2). 2

Corollary 4.9. For each 0  c < k(k − 1), there exist integers mc and c with mc ≡ 0 (mod k(k − 1)) and
c ≡ c (mod k(k − 1)) for which a k-OC(mc + c , c ) exists.
Proof. Let t 0 and r0 be integers with t 0 ≡ 1 (mod k(k − 1)) and t 0 > 1 so that whenever r  r0 , t  t 0 ,
and t ≡ 1 (mod k(k − 1)),
(1) there is a k-DGDD of type (2r )t (apply Theorem 4.7), and
(2) there is a k-BIBD on 2t + k − 2 (≡ k (mod k(k − 1))) elements (apply Theorem 2.1).
When c ≡ 1 (mod k − 1), apply Corollary 4.4 to choose one k-OC(mc + c , c ) with mc ≡
0 (mod k(k − 1)) and mc  r0 . In general, when a k-OC(mc + c , c ) with mc ≡ 0 (mod k(k − 1)) and
mc  r0 exists, Theorem 4.8 produces a k-OC(mc t 0 + k − 2 + c , mc + c + k − 2). Set mc +k−2 mod k(k−1) =
mc (t 0 − 1), which exceeds r0 and is a multiple of k(k − 1). Set c +k−2 mod k(k−1) = mc + c + k − 2 ≡
c + k − 2 (mod k(k − 1)). Then k − 2 applications of Theorem 4.8 handle all congruence classes. 2
5. Asymptotic existence
Our next task is to handle not just one example for hole size in each congruence class modulo
k(k − 1), but to extend to all suﬃciently large orders.
Theorem 5.1. Let k  2 be an integer. Then there are constants κk and uk so that whenever v  κk , there is a
k-OP( v , h) and a k-OC( v , h) with h  uk .

Proof. By Corollary 4.9, for 0  c < k(k − 1) there are integers mc ≡ 0 (mod k(k − 1)) and c ≡
c (mod k(k − 1)) for which a k-OC(mc + c , c ) exists. By Lemma 4.5, for 0  c < k(k − 1) there are
integers nc ≡ 0 (mod k(k − 1)) and hc ≡ c (mod k(k − 1)) for which a k-OP(nc + hc , hc ) exists. Set
uk = max{nc + hc , mc + c : 0  c < k(k − 1)}.

Using Theorem 2.4, choose an integer x for which k-GDDs of type (k(k − 1))x exist for all x ∈
{x, x + 1, x + 2, x + 3}. Again using Theorem 2.4, choose an integer r for which an {x + 1, x + 2, x + 3}GDD of type p g exists for all 1  p  uk and all g  r. Then set κk = rk(k − 1) + uk , a constant
depending only on k.
We develop the remainder of the proof for packings; that for coverings parallels it very closely. Let
v  κk be an integer, and write v = φ k(k − 1) + c with 0  c < k(k − 1). Write v − hc = gnc + d so that
d ≡ 0 (mod k(k − 1)) and d < nc . Let n = nc /(k(k − 1)) and d = d/(k(k − 1)).

Construct a k-GDD of type nc d1 as follows. Form an {x + 1, x + 2, x + 3}-GDD of type (n ) g +1 .

of size nc together with the hc new elements, aligning the hole on these hc elements. The result is a
k-OP( v , hc + d), and hc + d  uk as required. 2

blocks. A covering
on h points in which every block contains some pair that is covered only once has


at most 2k blocks, which is a constant independent of v. Use this to ﬁll the hole. 2
6. Conclusion

For t = 2, our results establish that the elementary Johnson and Schönheim bounds are essentially
the correct ones, in that the respective optima cannot differ from them by more than an additive
constant. Unless this constant can be shown to be quite small, the speciﬁc value obtained for the
constant is not of particular interest. Without recourse to Proposition 1.1 or a similar statement, we
see no way at present to obtain differences from the bounds that are bounded by a quantity as small
as (say) k in general, although it is plausible that such bounds hold.

Hierarchical Recovery in Compressive Sensing

Abstract
A combinatorial approach to compressive sensing based on a deterministic column replacement technique is proposed.
Informally, it takes as input a pattern matrix and ingredient measurement matrices, and results in a larger measurement matrix
by replacing elements of the pattern matrix with columns from the ingredient matrices. This hierarchical technique yields great
flexibility in sparse signal recovery. Specifically, recovery for the resulting measurement matrix does not depend on any fixed
algorithm but rather on the recovery scheme of each ingredient matrix. In this paper, we investigate certain trade-offs for signal
recovery, considering the computational investment required. Coping with noise in signal recovery requires additional conditions,
both on the pattern matrix and on the ingredient measurement matrices.

I. I NTRODUCTION
Nyquist’s sampling theorem provides a sufficient condition for full recovery of a band-limited signal: sample the signal at a
rate that is twice the band-limit. However, there are cases when full recovery may be achieved with a sub-Nyquist sampling
rate. This occurs with signals that are sparse (or compressible) in some domain, such as those that arise in applications in
sensing, imaging, and communications, and has given rise to the field of compressive sensing [2], [6] (also called compressive
sampling).
Consider the following framework for compressive sensing. An admissible signal of dimension n is a vector in Rn that is
known a priori to be taken from a given set Φ ⊆ Rn . A measurement matrix A is a matrix from Rm×n . Sampling a signal
x ∈ Rn corresponds to computing the product Ax = b. Once sampled, recovery involves determining the unique signal x ∈ Φ
that satisfies Ax = b using only A and b. If Φ = Rn , recovery can be accomplished only if A has rank n, and hence m ≥ n.
However for more restrictive admissible sets Φ, recovery may be accomplished when m < n.
Given a measurement matrix A, an equivalence relation ≡A is defined so that for signals x, y ∈ Rn , we have x ≡A y
if and only if Ax = Ay. If for every equivalence class P under ≡A , the set P ∩ Φ contains at most one signal then in
principle recovery is possible. Because Ax = Ay ensures that A(x − y) = 0, this can be stated more simply: An equivalence
class P of ≡A can be represented as {x + y : y ∈ N (A)} for any x ∈ P , where N (A) is the null space of A, i.e., the set
{x ∈ Rn : Ax = 0}. Recoverability is therefore equivalent to requiring that, for every signal x ∈ Φ, there is no y ∈ N (A)\{0}
with x + y ∈ Φ.
In order to make use of these observations, a reasonable a priori restriction on the signals to be sampled is identified, suitable
measurement matrices with m ≪ n are formed, and a reasonably efficient computational strategy for recovering the signal is
provided. A signal is t-sparse if at most t of its n coordinates are nonzero. The recovery of t-sparse signals is the domain
of compressive sensing. An admissible set of signals Φ has sparsity t when every signal in Φ is t-sparse. An admissible set
of signals Φ is t-sparsifiable if there is a full rank matrix B ∈ Rn×n for which {Bx : x ∈ Φ} has sparsity t. We assume
throughout that when the signals are sparsifiable, a change of basis B is applied so that the admissible signals have sparsity t.
A measurement matrix has (ℓ0 , t)-recoverability when it permits exact recovery of all t-sparse signals. A basic problem is
to design measurement matrices with (ℓ0 , t)-recoverability where m ≪ n such that recovery can be accomplished efficiently.
Suppose that measurement matrix A has (ℓ0 , t)-recoverability. Then in principle, given A and b, recovery of the signal x can
be accomplished by solving the ℓ0 -minimization problem min{||x||0 : Ax = b}. To do so the possible supports of signals
from fewest nonzero entries to most are first listed. For each, reduce A to A′ and x to x′ by eliminating coordinates in the
signal assumed to be zero. Examine the now overdetermined system A′ x′ = b. When equality holds, a solution is found; we
are guaranteed to find one by considering all possible supports
with at most t nonzero entries. Such an enumerative strategy is

prohibitively time-consuming, examining as many as nt linear systems when the signal has sparsity t. Natarajan [27] showed
that we cannot expect to find a substantially more efficient solution, because the problem is NP-hard.
Instead of the ℓ0 -minimization problem, Chen, Donoho, Huo, and Saunders [11], [18] suggest considering the ℓ1 -minimization
problem min{||x||1 : Ax = b}. While this can be solved using standard linear programming techniques, to be effective it
is necessary that for each t-sparse signal x, the unique solution to min{||z||1 : Az = Ax} is x. This property is (ℓ1 , t)recoverability. A necessary and sufficient condition for (ℓ1 , t)-recoverability has been explored, beginning with Donoho and
Huo [18] and subsequently in [19]–[21], [24], [30], [31], [33].

A measurement matrix A meets the (ℓ0 , t)-null space condition if and only if N (A) \ {0} contains no (2t)-sparse vector.
For y ∈ Rn and C ⊂ {1, . . . , n}, define y|C ∈ Rn to be the vector such that (y|C )γ = yγ if γ ∈ C and (y|C )γ = 0
otherwise. A measurement matrix A meets the (ℓ1 , t)-null space condition if and only if for every y ∈ N (A) \ {0} and every
C ⊂ {1, . . . , n} with |C| = t, ||y|C ||1 < 12 ||y||1 .
Lemma 1: ([13], for example) Measurement matrix A ∈ Rm×n has (ℓ0 , t)-recoverability if and only if A meets the (ℓ0 , t)null space condition.

Lemma 2: ([33], for example) Measurement matrix A ∈ Rm×n has (ℓ1 , t)-recoverability if and only if A meets the (ℓ1 , t)null space condition.

To establish (ℓ1 , t)-recoverability, and hence also (ℓ0 , t)-recoverability, Candès and Tao [7], [9] introduced the Restricted
Isometry Property (RIP). For A ∈ Rm×n , the dth RIP parameter of A, δd (A), is the smallest δ so that, for some constant R > 0,
(1 − δ)R(||x||2 )2 ≤ (||Ax||2 )2 ≤ (1 + δ)R(||x||2 )2 , for all x with ||x||0 ≤ d. The dth RIP parameter is better when δd (A)
is smaller as the bounds are tighter. The RIP parameters have been employed extensively to establish (ℓ1 , t)-recoverability,
particularly for randomly generated measurement
matrices [8]–[10], but also for those generated using deterministic con√
structions [12], [17]. Commonly, δ2t < 2 − 1 is required for (ℓ1 , t)-recoverability; see [7] for example. The property of
(ℓ1 , t)-recoverability in the presence of noise has also been considered. Conditions on the RIP parameters are sufficient but in
general not necessary for recoverability.
Combinatorial approaches to compressive sensing are detailed in [3], [16], [22], [23], [25], [26], [32]. We pursue a different
combinatorial approach here, using a deterministic column replacement technique based on hash families. The use of an
heterogeneous hash family provides an explicit hierarchical construction of a large measurement matrix from a library of
small ingredient matrices. Strengthening hash families provide a means to increase the level of sparsity supporte, allowing the
ingredient matrices to be designed for lower sparsity than the larger measurement matrix produced.
In this paper we show that the heterogeneity extends to signal recovery: it is interesting that the ingredient measurement
matrices need not all employ the same recovery algorithm. This enables hierarchical recovery for the large measurement matrix;
however, this can be computationally prohibitive. By restricting the hash family to be linear, recovery for the large measurement
matrix can be achieved in sublinear time even when computationally intensive methods are used for each ingredient matrix. To
be practical, recovery methods based on hash families must deal with noise in the signal effectively. Suitable restrictions on
the hash family and on each ingredient matrix used in the hierarchical method are shown to be sufficient to permit recovery
in the presence of noise.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. The results on homogeneous hash families in Section II demonstrate that
a recovery scheme based on (ℓ0 , t)- or (ℓ1 , t)-recoverability can be ‘lifted’ from the ingredient measurement matrices to the
matrix resulting from column replacement. Section III considers a generalization of hash families to allow for ingredient
matrices with other recovery algorithms, and the computational investment to recover the signal. Signal recovery without noise
is considered first, and the conditions for a sublinear time recovery algorithm described. Section IV considers the recovery of
almost-sparse signals to deal with noise in the signal. Finally, Section V draws relevant conclusions.

When the ingredient matrix A is a measurement matrix that meets one of the null space conditions for a given sparsity, our
interest is to ensure that the sparsity supported by B is at least that of A. Not every pattern matrix P suffices for this purpose.
Therefore, we examine the requirements on P .
Let m, n, and k be positive integers. An hash family HF(m; n, k), P = (pij ), is an m × n array, in which each cell contains
one symbol from a set of k symbols. An hash family is perfect of strength t, denoted PHF(m; n, k, t), if in every m × t

3

subarray of P at least one row consists of distinct symbols; see [1], [28]. Fig. 2 gives an example of a perfect hash family
PHF(6; 12, 3, 3). For example, for the 6 × 3 subarray involving columns 4, 5, and 6, only the fourth row consists of distinct
symbols.

A perfect hash family PHF(6; 12, 3, 3).

A perfect hash family has at least one row that separates the t columns into t parts in every m × t subarray. A weaker
conditionP
separates the t columns into classes. A {w1 , . . . , ws }-separating hash family, denoted SHF(m; n, k, {w1 , . . . , ws }),
s
with t = i=1 wi , is an m × n array on k symbols in which for every m × t subarray, and every way to partition the t columns
into classes of sizes w1 , . . . , ws , there is at least one row in which no two classes contain the same symbol; see [4], [29]. A
W-separating hash family, denoted SHF(m; n, k, W), is a {w1 , . . . , ws }-separating hash family for each {w1 , . . . , ws } ∈ W.
Fig. 3 gives an example of a {1, 2}-separating hash family SHF(3; 16, 4, {1, 2}). For the 3 × 3 subarray consisting of columns
11, 15, and 16, for example, the last row separates columns {11, 16} from column {15}.

A distributing hash family DHF(10; 13, 9, 5, 2).

Now, we are in a position to state the requirements on a pattern matrix P that ensure that the sparsity supported by the
matrix B resulting from column replacement is at least that of A.
Theorem 1: [13] Suppose that A is an r × k measurement matrix that meets the (ℓ0 , t)-null space condition, that P is an
SHF(m; n, k, {1, t}), and that B is the column replacement of A into P . Then B is an rm × n measurement matrix that meets
the (ℓ0 , t)-null space condition.

Theorem 2: [13] Suppose that A is an r × k measurement matrix that meets the (ℓ1 , t)-null space condition, that P is a
DHF(m; n, k, t + 1, 2), and that B is the column replacement of A into P . Then B is an rm × n measurement matrix that
meets the (ℓ1 , t)-null space condition.

B. Exploiting Heterogeneity in Column Replacement
All the standard definitions of hash families may be generalized by replacing k by k = (k1 , . . . , km ), a tuple of positive
integers. Now, an heterogeneous hash family HF(m; n, k), P = (pij ), is an m × n array in which each cell from row i contains
one symbol from a set of ki symbols, 1 ≤ i ≤ m.
Column replacement may be extended to exploit heterogeneity in an hash family. Let P = (pij ) be an HF(m; n, k) and, for
1 ≤ i ≤ m, let Ai be an ri × ki ingredient matrix whose columns are indexed by the ki elements P
in row i of P . For each
row i of P , replace the element pij with a copy of column pij of Ai , 1 ≤ j ≤ n. The result is a ( m
i=1 ri ) × n matrix B,
the column replacement of A1 , . . . , Am into P . Fig. 5 gives an example of column replacement using an heterogeneous hash
family.

An hierarchical method for compressive sensing is obtained using column replacement in an heterogeneous hash family.
Suppose that Ai is a measurement matrix for a signal of dimension ki supporting the recovery of sparsity qi , for 1 ≤ i ≤ m.
We now describe the properties the pattern matrix needs to satisfy to support recovery of signals of dimension n and sparsity
t.
In Section II-A, we saw that a perfect hash family separates t columns into t parts, and that a separating hash family
separates t columns into classes. We now define a particular type of separating hash family in which the number of symbols
used to accomplish the separations is restricted.
Let d = (d1 , . . . , dm ) be a tuple of positive integers, and let τ be a positive P
integer. Let W = {W1 , . . . , Wr }, where for
si
1 ≤ i ≤ r, Wi = {wi1 , . . . , wisi } is a multiset of nonnegative integers, and σi = j=1
wij . An SHF(m; n, k, W), P = (pij ),
is (d, τ )-strengthening if whenever 1 ≤ i ≤ r,
• C is a set of σi columns,
• C1 , . . . , Csi is a partition of C with |Cj | = wij for 1 ≤ j ≤ si , and
• T is a set of τ columns with |C ∩ T | = min(σi , τ ),
there exists a row ρ for which pρx 6= pρy whenever x ∈ Ce , y ∈ Cf and e 6= f and the multiset {pρx : x ∈ T } contains no
more than dρ different symbols. When τ = max{σi : 1 ≤ i ≤ r}, we omit τ and write d-strengthening. Because rows of P
can be arbitrarily permuted (while permuting the ingredient matrices in the same manner), the order of elements in k and d is
inconsequential. Hence we often use exponential notation, writing xu1 1 · · · xus s , with ui a non-negative integer for 1 ≤ i ≤ s,
Pℓ−1
Pℓ
Ps
for a vector (y1 , . . . , yPsj=1 uj ) in which yℓ = xj for j=1 uj < ℓ ≤ j=1 uj for 1 ≤ ℓ ≤ j=1 uj .
Fig. 6 gives a heterogeneous d-strengthening DHF(19; 13, k, 5, 2) with k = (56 41 312 ) and d = (46 313 ). This is equivalent
to a d-strengthening SHF(19; 13, k, {{1, 4}, {2, 3}}). Consider the separation of columns {1, 7} from columns {2, 6, 11}. Row
8 accomplishes the required separation because it uses no more than d8 = 3 symbols. Consider instead columns {1, . . . , 5}.
While the first row separates {1, 2, 3} from {4, 5}, it uses 5 symbols instead of d1 = 4 and so does not accomplish the required
separation; this separation is accomplished in row 3.
Next the properties are determined for an heterogeneous hash family to support recovery of signals of dimension n and
sparsity t using a column replacement technique.
Theorem 3: [14] Let k = (k1 , . . . , km ) and q = (q1 , . . . , qm ) be tuples of positive integers. Let d = (2q1 , . . . , 2qm ). For
1 ≤ i ≤ m, let Ai ∈ Rri ×ki be a measurement matrix that meets the (ℓ0 , qi )-null space condition. Let P be a (d, 2t)strengthening SHF(m; n, k, {1, t}), and let B be the column replacement of A1 , . . . , Am into P . Then B meets the (ℓ0 , t)-null
space condition.
Theorem 4: [14] Let k = (k1 , . . . , km ) and q = (q1 , . . . , qm ) be tuples of positive integers. For 1 ≤ i ≤ m, let Ai ∈ Rri ×ki
be a measurement matrix that meets the (ℓ1 , qi )-null space condition. Let P be a (q, t)-strengthening DHF(m; n, k, t + 1, 2),
and let B be the column replacement of A1 , . . . , Am into P . Then B meets the (ℓ1 , t)-null space condition.

Revisiting the d-strengthening DHF(19; 13, k, 5, 2) pattern matrix in Fig. 6, the results of Theorems 3 and 4 indicate that
the number of symbols in each row need not be the same. In general, there may be as many ingredient matrices Ai as there
are rows of the pattern matrix P . Moreover, the strength of each ingredient matrix Ai may be different! In this example, the

A heterogeneous d-strengthening DHF(19; 13, k, 5, 2) with k = (56 41 312 ) and d = (46 313 ).

first 6 rows use 4 symbols to separate, so the corresponding ingredient matrices must have strength at least 4. The remaining
rows use 3 symbols to separate, so the corresponding ingredient matrices must have strength at least 3.
In [14], we showed that heterogeneity gives great flexibility in construction of measurement matrices using column replacement. The hierarchical structure of the measurement matrices produced by column replacement can also aid in recovery, and
be used to support hybrid recovery schemes. We examine this problem next, considering a generalization of hash families that
removes the restriction to those strategies based only on (ℓ0 , t)- or (ℓ1 , t)-recoverability. We also consider the computational
investment required to recover the signal.
III. H ASH FAMILIES FOR R ECOVERY
In order to tackle signal recovery, we require another generalization of hash families. As before, let k = (k1 , . . . , km ) be a
tuple of positive integers. An HF◦ (m; n, k) is an m × n array, P = (pij ), in which each cell contains one symbol, and for each
row 1 ≤ i ≤ m, {pij : 1 ≤ j ≤ n} ⊆ {◦, 1, . . . , ki }. The symbol ◦, when present, is interpreted as representing a ‘missing’
entry. When the pattern matrix P = (pij ) is an HF◦ (m; n, k), and for 1 ≤ i ≤ m the ingredient matrix Ai is ri × ki with
columns indexed by the ki symbols in row i of P other than ◦, the column replacement of A1 , . . . , Am into P is as before,
except that when pij = ◦, it is replaced with an all zero column vector of length ri . As we will see, the separating properties
of the hash families we use allow us to locate the nonzero coordinates of the signal and hence perform the recovery.
The definition of a W-separating hash family encompasses perfect, {w1 , . . . , ws }-separating, and distributing hash families.
Therefore, we need only extend the definition of W-separating hash families to include the ◦ symbol. To do so, we allow
some of the elements of the multisets in W to be marked with a ◦ superscript to form a set of marked multisets W ′ ; the
multisets in W ′ are indexed. Then an HF◦ (m; n, k) is W ′ -separating if, for each {w1 , . . . , ws } ∈ W (with some elements
possibly marked),
Ps
• whenever C is a set of
i=1 wi columns, and
• C1 , . . . , Cs is an (indexed) partition of C with |Ci | = wi for 1 ≤ i ≤ s
then there exists a row that separates C1 , . . . , Cs in which, for 1 ≤ j ≤ s, if ◦ appears in a column in Cj then wj is marked.
As we will see, to recover the signal, the idea is to effect a separation where a significant coordinate of the signal is present
in one class such that any other class does not prevent its recovery.
A. Signal Recovery without Noise
Theorems 3 and 4 suggest that a recovery scheme based on (ℓ0 , t)- or (ℓ1 , t)-recoverability can be ‘lifted’ from the ingredient
measurement matrices A1 , . . . , Am to the larger measurement matrix B obtained from column replacement. However, such a
method appears to have two main drawbacks. First, it is restricted to recovery strategies based on (ℓ0 , t)- or (ℓ1 , t)-recoverability.
Secondly, and perhaps more importantly, it appears to necessitate a large computational investment to recover the signal, given
B.

6

In order to overcome these problems, we consider two cases. The positive case arises when the signal is known a priori to
be in Rn≥0 . The general case arises when the signal can be positive, negative, or zero. In each case we develop a recovery
scheme for the matrix B resulting from column replacement that does not depend on any fixed algorithm, but rather on the
recovery schemes for the ingredient matrices A1 , . . . , Am .
We suppose that P = (pij ) is an HF◦ (m; n, k). For each 1 ≤ i ≤ m, we suppose that Ai is an ri × ki measurement matrix
that has (ℓ0 , t)-recoverability, equipped with a recovery algorithm Ri that determines the unique t-sparse vector zi that solves
Ai zi = yi . We further suppose that B is the column replacement of A1 , . . . , Am into P , and that y is the result of sampling
an (unknown) t-sparse vector x = (x1 , . . . , xn ) using B.
For 1 ≤ i ≤ m, the ith row of P induces a partition {Si◦ , Si1 , . . . , Siki } of the column indices {1, . . . , n}, where Siσ =
{j : pij = σ, 1 ≤ j ≤ n} for σ ∈ {◦, 1, . . . , ki }. Assume that we have employed the recovery algorithms Ri to find solutions
zi . For 1 ≤ i ≤ m and σ ∈ {◦, 1, . . . , ki }, the partition class Siσ is discarded if σ = ◦, insignificant if σ 6= ◦ and ziσ = 0,
significant positive if ziσ > 0, and significant negative if ziσ
P< 0.
For 1 ≤ i ≤ m, let wi = (wi1 , . . . , wiki ) where wiσ = j∈Siσ xj . The vector wi can be considered as a projection of x
induced by the symbol pattern in row i of P . These facts follow:
i
• For 1 ≤ i ≤ m, by the definition of B and because Bi x = yi , zi = wi is a solution to A zi = yi .
i
• For 1 ≤ i ≤ m, because A has (ℓ0 , t)-recoverability and wi is t-sparse (because x is t-sparse), zi = wi is the unique
solution to Ai zi = yi , and so Ri returns wi .
We now consider the positive case and the general case for recovery in succession.
B. Signal Recovery: The Positive Case
We establish that in the positive case with t-sparse signals, it suffices to use a separating hash family of suitable strength,
along with suitable ingredient matrices. An SHF◦ (m; n, k, {1, t◦ }) separates t + 1 columns into two parts, one part of size one
that cannot include the symbol ◦, and the other of size t that may include ◦.
Theorem 5: Suppose that P is an SHF◦ (m; n, k, {1, t◦ }). For 1 ≤ i ≤ m, let Ai ∈ Rri ×ki be a measurement matrix that
has (ℓ0 , t)-recoverability equipped with a recovery algorithm Ri that determines the unique t-sparse vector zi that solves
Ai zi = yi . Further suppose that B is the column replacement of measurement matrices A1 , . . . , Am into P and that y is the
result of sampling an (unknown) t-sparse vector x = (x1 , . . . , xn ) ∈ Rn≥0 using B. Then the t-sparse solution x to Bx = y
can be recovered.

Proof: It suffices to determine whether xi is positive or zero for each 1 ≤ i ≤ n, because once this is accomplished we
can find the values of the positive xi by solving the overdetermined system that remains. For 1 ≤ i ≤ m, apply recovery
algorithm Ri to find the unique t-sparse vector zi such that Ai zi = yi . We claim that, for 1 ≤ ℓ ≤ n, xℓ is positive if and
only if for each i ∈ {1, . . . , m} the partition class that contains ℓ is either significant positive or discarded.
Suppose
P first that xℓ is positive. If Siσ is a partition class that contains ℓ, then either σ = ◦ and Siσ is insignificant or σ 6= ◦,
ziσ = j∈Siσ xj ≥ xℓ > 0, and Siσ is significant positive. Now suppose that xℓ = 0. Let C = {j : xj > 0, 1 ≤ j ≤ n};
|C| ≤ t. There must be a row ρ of P that separates C from {ℓ} such that pρℓ 6= ◦. Let σ = pρℓ . Then ℓ ∈ Sρσ and Sρσ ∩C = ∅,
so Sρσ is insignificant.
One useful application of Theorem 5 takes the pattern matrix P to be an SHF◦ (m; n, 1, {1, t◦ }), and each Ai to be a 1 × 1
matrix whose only element is 1; in this case, column replacement yields a matrix B isomorphic to P . In P for every column
γ and every set C of t columns with γ 6∈ C, there is a row in which all columns of C contain ◦, while column γ contains
1. Then the measurement matrices Ai have (ℓ0 , t)-recoverability and the recovery algorithms Ri are trivial. Hence in these
cases, a matrix isomorphic to P itself supports recovery.
Theorem 5 leads to a straightforward recovery algorithm. First, Ri is used to solve Ai zi = yi for 1 ≤ i ≤ m. Then the
classes Sij areP
classified as positive when zij > 0, discarded when j = ◦, and insignificant when j 6= ◦ and zij = 0; this can
m
be done in O( i=1 ki ) time. We need only compute, for each row, the complement of the union of the insignificant classes,
and then compute the intersection over all rows of these complements. However, without additional structure this appears to
require the examination of each coordinate; hence, this gives an Ω(n) lower bound.
It is not difficult, nevertheless, to obtain sublinear recovery times by restricting the hash family; we return to this problem
in Section III-D.
C. Signal Recovery: The General Case
When the signal takes on both positive and negative values, cancellation of positive and negative contributions can yield a
zero measurement despite the presence of a signal. Nevertheless, an additional requirement on the structure of the hash family

7

suffices to address this problem, as we show next.
Theorem 6: Suppose that P is an SHF◦ (m; n, k, {{τ, (t + 1 − τ )◦ } : 1 ≤ τ ≤ t}). For 1 ≤ i ≤ m, let Ai ∈ Rri ×ki be a
measurement matrix that has (ℓ0 , t)-recoverability equipped with a recovery algorithm Ri that determines the unique t-sparse
vector zi that solves Ai zi = yi . Further suppose that B is the column replacement of measurement matrices A1 , . . . , Am into
P and that y is the result of sampling an (unknown) t-sparse vector x = (x1 , . . . , xn ) using B. Then the t-sparse solution x
to Bx = y can be recovered.

Proof: As in the proof of Theorem 5, it suffices to determine whether xi is nonzero or zero for each 1 ≤ i ≤ n,
because once this is accomplished we can find the values of the nonzero xi by solving the overdetermined system that
remains. For 1 ≤ i ≤ m, apply recovery algorithm Ri to find the unique t-sparse vector zi such that Ai zi = yi . Let
−
z+
i = (max(0, zij ) : 1 ≤ j ≤ ki ) and zi = (min(0, zij ) : 1 ≤ j ≤ ki ).
+
′
A row i of P is maximum positive if ||z+
i ||1 ≥ ||zi′ ||1 for 1 ≤ i ≤ m. Let M ⊆ {1, . . . , m} index the maximum positive
rows. We claim that a coordinate xℓ is positive if and only if, for every ρ ∈ M , ℓ is in a significant positive class of the
partition induced by row ρ.
Suppose first that xℓ is positive and let ρ ∈ M . Because ρ indexes a maximum positive row, the partition class induced
by row ρ that contains ℓ is not discarded and does not contain the index of any negative variable. Thus it is in a significant
positive partition class.
Now suppose that xℓ ≤ 0. Because P is an SHF◦ (m; n, k, {{τ, (t + 1 − τ )◦ } : 1 ≤ τ ≤ t}) and x is t-sparse, there is a row
ρ of P that separates {j : xj > 0, 1 ≤ j ≤ n} from {j : xj < 0, 1 ≤ j ≤ n} ∪ {ℓ} in which the symbol ◦ only appears in a
subset of the columns indexed by {j : xj < 0, 1 ≤ j ≤ n} ∪ {ℓ}. It follows that ρ is a maximum positive row of P and that
the partition class induced by ρ containing ℓ does not contain the index of any positive coordinate. So ρ ∈ M , but ℓ is not in
a significant positive class of the partition induced by row ρ.
In the same manner, all negative coordinates can be identified using maximum negative rows.

Again a straightforward recovery algorithm is given by Theorem 6 but, as in the positive case, it naively involves examining
each of the n coordinates.
D. Sublinear Time Signal Recovery
Recovery can be accomplished in time that is sublinear in k when the hash family has suitable structure; we develop a
general approach, and one example, here. In each case, for some subset M of the rows of P , sets are identified that must
contain the indices of all positive coordinates (the indices of the negative coordinates, if they exist, can be located similarly).
Recall from Section III-A, that the positive case arises when the signal is known a priori to be in Rn≥0 and the general case
arises when the signal can be positive, negative, or zero. In the positive case, M contains all rows and for ρ ∈ M , the candidate
indices are Vρ+ = {ℓ : pρℓ = ◦, or xℓ ∈ Sρj and zρj > 0}. In the general case, M contains all rows that index maximum
positive rows, and for ρ ∈ M , the candidate indices are Vρ+ = {ℓ : xℓ ∈ Sρj and zρj > 0}. In both cases, we are to determine
T
+
we do not list the members of Vρ+ explicitly, but rather use
ρ∈M Vρ . In order to avoid the examination of each
T coordinate,
+
an implicit representation to list the members of ρ∈M Vρ .
First we give an implicit representation of an hash family HF(q + 1; q α , q), P , where q is a prime power and 2 ≤ α ≤ q.
Let {ω0 , . . . , ωq−1 } be the elements of the finite field of order q, Fq . Index the rows of P by {∞} ∪ {ω0 , . . . , ωq−1 }. Index
the columns of P by the q α polynomials of degree less than α in indeterminate x, with coefficients in Fq . Now the entry of
P with row index β and column indexed by polynomial f (x) is determined as f (β) when β ∈ {ω0 , . . . , ωq−1 }, and as the
coefficient of xα−1 in f (x) when β = ∞.
By deleting rows, we form an HF(m; q α , q) for some 1 ≤ m ≤ q + 1. An hash family is linear if it is obtained in this way.
The separation properties of such an hash family are crucial [1], [5]. For our purposes, the observation of interest is from [15]:
if m ≥ (α − 1)w1 w2 + 1, then a linear HF(m; n, q) is {w1 , w2 }-separating. (This can be established by a simple argument:
When two polynomials of degree less than α evaluate to the same value at α different points, they are the same polynomial.) In
some cases, fewer rows suffice to ensure separation. In particular, Blackburn and Wild [5] establish that when q is sufficiently
large, one needs at most α(w1 + w2 − 1) rows; and in [15] specific small separations are examined to determine the set of
prime powers for which various numbers of rows less than (α − 1)w1 w2 + 1 suffice. We proceed with the general statement
so as not to impose additional conditions.
When m ≥ (α − 1)t + 1, P is {1, t}-separating; in addition, every {1, t − 1}-separation is accomplished in at least α rows.
t+1
When m ≥ (α − 1)⌊ t+1
2 ⌋⌈ 2 ⌉+ 1, P is {w, t+ 1 − w}-separating for each 1 ≤ w ≤ t; in addition, every {w, t− w}-separation
t+1
t
t
t+1
is accomplished in at least α rows, because ⌊ t+1
2 ⌋⌈ 2 ⌉ = ⌊ 2 ⌋⌈ 2 ⌉ + ⌊ 2 ⌋. Thus in either case, M contains at least α rows
of P .

8

Q
Choose any α rows U = {ψ1 , . . . ψα } ⊆ M . Now consider the sets {Vψ+ : ψ ∈ U }. Define ψ∈U |Vψ+ | vectors V + =
{(g1 , . . . , gα ) : gi ∈ {pψi ℓ : ℓ ∈ Vψ+i } for 1 ≤ i ≤ α}. Each (g1 , . . . , gα ) ∈ V + defines a unique column of the hash family,
corresponding to the unique polynomial L of degree at most α − 1 satisfying L(ψi ) = gi for 1 ≤ i ≤ α. Any column that does
not arise in this way from a member of V + cannot be the column for a positive coordinate, because in the partition induced
by one of the selected maximum rows it is not in a significant positive class. However, columns arising from vectors in V +
need not arise from positive coordinates, because we may not have examined all of the rows of M . Nevertheless, we can now
generate each of the columns arising from vectors in V + , and check for each whether it occurs in positive classes for all rows
of M , not just the α selected.
Now |V + | is O(tα ), so when t is o(q), the size of V + is o(n) (because n = q α ). For concreteness, taking q = tβ for t a
prime power, we can permit α to be as large as tβ−2 . (For the positive case, we can permit α to be as large as tβ−1 . ) Hence,
by restricting the hash family to one that is linear, it is possible to obtain recovery of the signal in sublinear time.
In general, a hash family together with its ingredient matrices can be represented more concisely compared to a random
measurement matrix for signal recovery. Furthermore, the hash family is an integer matrix, not a matrix of real numbers,
and may therefore be easier to encode. When the hash family is linear an implicit representation of it may be used, further
compacting its representation.
The results of this section provide some evidence that column replacement enables recoverability conditions to be met. In
Section IV, we show that it also preserves the basic machinery to deal with noise in the signal.
E. Adding Strengthening
As the signal length increases, it is natural to support high sparsity. Yet the techniques developed until this point only
preserve sparsity. Strengthening hash families provide a means to increase the level of sparsity supported.
Theorem 7: Suppose that P is a d-strengthening SHF(m; n, k, {{τ, (t + 1 − τ )} : 1 ≤ τ ≤ t}). For each 1 ≤ i ≤ m, we
suppose that Ai is an ri × ki measurement matrix that has (ℓ1 , di )-recoverability, equipped with a recovery algorithm Ri , that
either determines the unique di -sparse vector zi that solves Ai zi = yi or indicates that no such vector exists. Further suppose
that B is the column replacement of A1 , . . . , Am into P , and that y is the result of sampling an (unknown) t-sparse vector
x = (x1 , . . . , xn ) using B. Then the t-sparse solution x to Bx = y can be recovered.

Proof: Again it suffices to locate the nonzero coordinates of x. For 1 ≤ i ≤ m, if recovery algorithm Ri returns a solution
zi such that ||zi ||1 ≥ ||z||1 for any solution z returned by an oracle Rj , then zi is a maximum solution, and row i of P is a
maximum row. Because P is a d-strengthening SHF(m; n, k, {{τ, (t + 1 − τ )} : 1 ≤ τ ≤ t}), and x is t-sparse, there is a row
ρ of P that separates {j : xj > 0, 1 ≤ j ≤ n} from {j : xj < 0, 1 ≤ j ≤ n} with the property that at most dρ symbols appear
in the columns indexed by {j : xj 6= 0, 1 ≤ j ≤ n}. So the projected vector wρ is dρ -sparse and it is the solution returned by
Rρ . By the definition of ρ, ||wρ ||1 = ||x||1 . It follows that the ℓ1 -norm of any maximum solution is at least ||x||1 .
We claim that if Ri returns a maximum solution zi , then zi = wi . Suppose otherwise. Then, because zi is a maximum
solution, we have ||zi ||1 ≥ ||x||1 . Further, it is clear from the definition of ||wi || that ||wi ||1 ≤ ||x||1 . Thus Ai zi = Ai wi , zi
is di -sparse, and ||zi ||1 ≥ ||wi ||1 , which is a contradiction to the fact that Ai has (ℓ1 , di )-recoverability.
Having established our claim, we can now use arguments similar to those used in the proof of Theorem 6 to show that
a coordinate xℓ is positive (negative) if and only if, for every maximum row in P , ℓ is in a significant positive (significant
negative) class of the partition induced by that row.
IV. R ECOVERY

WITH

N OISE

We now treat the recovery ofPsignals with noise. A signal (x1 , . . . , xn ) is (s, t)-almost sparse if there is a set T of at most
t coordinate indices such that i∈{1...,n}\T |xi | < s.

Theorem 8: Suppose that P is an SHF(m; n, k, {{τ, (t + 1 − τ )} : 1 ≤ τ ≤ t}). For each 1 ≤ i ≤ m, we suppose that Ai
is an ri × ki measurement matrix, equipped with recovery algorithm Ri , which, when applied to the sample obtained from an
(s, t)-almost sparse signal xi , returns a vector zi such that ||zi − xi ||1 < ǫ. Further suppose that B is the column replacement
of A1 , . . . , Am into P , and that y is the result of sampling an (unknown) (s, t)-almost sparse vector x = (x1 , . . . , xn ) using B.
Then, a (perfectly) t-sparse vector x∗ = (x∗1 , . . . , x∗n ) such that for 1 ≤ i ≤ n, |xi | < 2(s + ǫ) if x∗i = 0, and |xi − x∗i | < s + ǫ
if x∗i > 0, and such that Bx∗ = y, can be recovered.
Proof: We provide a sketch first, and then the details. The idea is to write each coordinate of z as a sum of the signal
coordinates in T that contribute to it, and of a noise term e that includes both the small contributions from coordinates outside
T and the error less than ǫ from the recovery algorithm. For each row ρ of P , we then split this sum into two parts: one part

9

containing terms with the same sign as the z coordinate to which they contribute (indexed by sets Tρ′ and Eρ′ ), and another part
containing terms with the opposite sign to the z coordinate to which they contribute (indexed by sets Tρ′′ and Eρ′′ ). The key
observation is that the sum of the terms with indices in Tρ′′ can be approximated by 12 (||x|| − ||zρ ||) and hence by 21 (q − ||zρ ||)
′′
because if Tρ′′ is empty then zρ has norm close to ||x||, and
Pevery term with index in T+ρ reduces ||zρ ||.
Let T be a set of at most t coordinate indices such that i∈{1...,n}\T |xi | < s. Let T = {i ∈ T : xi ≥ 0}, T − = {i ∈ T :
P
xi < 0} and q † = i∈T |xi |. For 1 ≤ i ≤ m, apply Ri to yi to find a vector zi such that ||zi − wi ||1 < ǫ. For i ∈ {1, . . . , m},
call ||zi ||1 the signature of row i of P and let q be the maximum signature of any row of P .
For 1 ≤ i ≤ n, we calculate upper and lower estimates u(i) and ℓ(i) for xi . For each row index ρ ∈ {1, . . . , m} and each
symbol σ ∈ {1, . . . , kρ } we define uρσ and ℓρσ as follows.
1
1
• If zρσ ≥ 0, then uρσ = |zρσ | + 2 (q − ||zρ ||1 ) and ℓρσ = − 2 (q − ||zρ ||1 ).
1
1
• If zρσ < 0, then uρσ = 2 (q − ||zρ ||1 ) and ℓρσ = −|zρσ | − 2 (q − ||zρ ||1 ).
For each i ∈ {1, . . . , n} define uρ (i) = uρπ and ℓρ (i) = ℓρπ , where π is the symbol in row ρ of P such that i ∈ Sρπ , and
define u(i) = min{uρ (i) : 1 ≤ ρ ≤ m} and ℓ(i) = max{ℓρ (i) : 1 ≤ ρ ≤ m}. By first examining a row of maximum signature,
we can immediately conclude for each i ∈ {1, . . . , n} either that u(i) = 0 or that ℓ(i) = 0. Define a vector x∗ = (x∗1 , . . . , x∗n )
by setting x∗i = 0 if |ui |, |ℓi | ≤ s + ǫ, and otherwise setting x∗i equal to whichever of u(i) or ℓ(i) has the greater absolute
value. We claim that x∗ satisfies the required conditions.
To establish this claim we prove that, for 1 ≤ j ≤ n,
(i) for each ρ ∈ {1, . . . , m}, ℓρ (j) − (s + ǫ) < xj < uρ (j) + (s + ǫ);
(ii) there is some ρ ∈ {1, . . . , m} such that ℓρ (j) > −(s + ǫ) if xj ≥ 0 and uρ (j) < s + ǫ if xj < 0; and
(iii) there is some ρ ∈ {1, . . . , m} such that uρ (j) − (s + ǫ) < xj if xj ≥ 0 and xj < ℓρ (j) + (s + ǫ) if xj < 0.
We begin with some observations used throughout the proof. Let ρ be a row of P . For 1 ≤ σ ≤ kρ , we have zρσ =

and let Tρ = T \ Tρ . Further, let Eρ = {σ ∈ {1, . . . , kρ } : eρσ , zρσ ≥ 0 or eρσ , zρσ < 0} and let Eρ′′ = {1, . . . , kρ } \ Eρ′ . For

It follows from (2) that each row of P has signature less than q † + (s + ǫ) and that any row of P that separates T + from T −
has signature greater than q † − (s + ǫ). Thus, q † − (s + ǫ) < q < q † + (s + ǫ) and hence

Let j ∈ {1, . . . , n}. We next show that (i), (ii) and (iii) hold in the case where xj ≥ 0. The proof in the case where xj < 0
is similar.
Proof of (i). Let ρ index any row of P and let Sρπ be the partition class induced by row ρ of P that contains j. Now
ℓρ (j) − (s + ǫ) < xjPbecause ℓρ (j) ≤ 0. If j ∈
/ T , then xj < s and xj < uρ (j) + (s + ǫ) because uρ (j) ≥ 0. If j ∈ T and
zρπ < 0, then xj ≤ i∈T ′′ |xi | and we see from (3) and (5) that xj < 21 (q − ||zρ ||1 ) + (s + ǫ). If j ∈ T and zρπ ≥ 0, then

xj ≤ i∈Tρ′ ∩Sρπ |xi | and we see from (4) and (5) that xj < |zρπ | + 12 (q − ||zρ ||1 ) + (s + ǫ).

Proof of (ii). Let ρ index a row of P that separates T + ∪ {j} from
induced by row
P T and let Sρπ be the partition class
ρ of P that contains j. If zρπ ≥ 0, then, for 1 ≤ σ ≤ kρ , either i∈T ′′ ∩Sρσ |xi | ≤ |eρσ | and σ ∈ Eρ′ or Tρ′′ ∩ Sρσ = ∅.
ρ
Using this, it follows from (3) and (5) that ℓρ (j)P= − 21 (q − ||zρ ||1 ) > −(s + ǫ). If zρπ < 0, then Tρ′ ∩ Sρπ = ∅ and π ∈ Eρ′ .
Furthermore, for σ ∈ {1, . . . , kρ } \ {π}, either i∈T ′′ ∩Sρσ |xi | < |eρσ | and σ ∈ Eρ′ or Tρ′′ ∩ Sρσ = ∅. Using these facts, it

and σ ∈ Eρ′ or Tρ′′ ∩ Sρσ = ∅. Then, it follows from (4) and (5) that uρ (j) = |zπρ | + 12 (q − ||zρ ||1 ) − (s + ǫ) < xj .
V. C ONCLUSION
Hierarchical construction of measurement matrices by column replacement permits the explicit construction of large measurement matrices from small ones. The use of heterogeneous hash families supports the use of a library of smaller ingredient
matrices, while the use of strengthening hash families allows the ingredient matrices to be designed for lower sparsity than
the larger measurement matrix produced. Perhaps surprisingly, the ingredient measurement matrices need not all employ
the same recovery algorithm; rather recovery for the large measurement matrix can use arbitrary routines for recovery that
are provided with the ingredient matrices. In this way, computationally intensive recovery methods can be used for the
ingredient matrices, which permits the selection of smaller matrices in general, while still enabling recovery for the large
measurement matrix. Nevertheless, recovery using the large measurement matrix can be computationally prohibitive without
further restrictions. Therefore it is shown that using a standard construction of linear hash families over the finite field, recovery
for the large measurement matrix can be effected in sublinear time. Indeed sublinear recovery time can be obtained even when
computationally intensive methods are used for each ingredient matrix. A practical implementation of these recovery methods
requires that the methods deal effectively with noise in the signal. Suitable restrictions on the hash family and on each ingredient
matrix used in column replacement are shown to be sufficient to permit recovery even in the presence of such noise.
Measurement matrices that result from one column replacement have been studied here. Because recovery does not depend
on the method by which recovery is done for the ingredient matrices, it is possible that the ingredient matrices themselves
are constructed by column replacement from even smaller ingredient matrices. The merits and demerits of repeated column
replacement deserve further study.

A Discrete Particle Swarm Optimization for
Covering Array Generation

Abstract—Software behavior depends on many factors.
Combinatorial testing (CT) aims to generate small sets of test
cases to uncover defects caused by those factors and their
interactions. Covering array generation, a discrete optimization
problem, is the most popular research area in the field of CT.
Particle swarm optimization (PSO), an evolutionary search-based
heuristic technique, has succeeded in generating covering arrays
that are competitive in size. However, current PSO methods for
covering array generation simply round the particle’s position
to an integer to handle the discrete search space. Moreover, no
guidelines are available to effectively set PSOs parameters for
this problem. In this paper, we extend the set-based PSO, an
existing discrete PSO (DPSO) method, to covering array generation. Two auxiliary strategies (particle reinitialization and
additional evaluation of gbest) are proposed to improve performance, and thus a novel DPSO for covering array generation
is developed. Guidelines for parameter settings both for conventional PSO (CPSO) and for DPSO are developed systematically
here. Discrete extensions of four existing PSO variants are developed, in order to further investigate the effectiveness of DPSO
for covering array generation. Experiments show that CPSO can
produce better results using the guidelines for parameter settings,
and that DPSO can generate smaller covering arrays than CPSO
and other existing evolutionary algorithms. DPSO is a promising
improvement on PSO for covering array generation.
Index Terms—Combinatorial testing (CT), covering array
generation, particle swarm optimization (PSO).

failures at a low cost is a key issue for test case generation. Combinatorial testing (CT) is a popular testing method
to detect failures triggered by various factors and their interactions [1]. By employing covering arrays as test suites, the CT
method aims to sample the large combination space with few
test cases to cover different interactions among a fixed number of factors. Kuhn and Reilly [2] shows that more than 70%
of the failures in certain software were caused by the interactions of one or two factors, and almost all the failures could
be detected by checking the interactions among six factors.
Therefore, CT can be an effective method in practice.
Generating a covering array with fewest tests (minimum
size) is a major challenge in CT. In general, the minimum
size of a covering array is unknown; hence, methods have
focused on finding covering arrays that have as few tests as
possible at reasonable search cost. The many methods that
have been proposed can be classified into two main groups:
1) mathematical methods and 2) computational methods [1].
Mathematical (algebraic or combinatorial) methods typically
exploit some known combinatorial structure. Computational
methods primarily use greedy strategies or heuristic-search
techniques to generate covering arrays, due to the size of the
search space.
Mathematical methods yield the best possible covering
arrays in certain cases. For example, orthogonal arrays used
in the design of experiments provide covering arrays with a
number of tests that is provably minimum. However, all known
mathematical methods can be applied only for restrictive sets
of factors. This limitation has led to an emphasis on computational methods. Greedy algorithms have been quite effective
in generating covering arrays, but their accuracy suffers from
becoming trapped in local optima.
In recent years, search-based software engineering (SBSE)
has focused on using search-based optimization algorithms
to find high-quality solutions for software engineering problems. Inspired by SBSE, many artificial intelligence-based
heuristic-search techniques have been applied to software
testing. For example, simulated annealing (SA) [3]–[7],
genetic algorithm (GA) [8]–[10], and ant colony
optimization (ACO) [9], [11], [12] have all been applied
to covering array generation. These techniques can generate
any types of covering arrays, and the constraint solving
and prioritization techniques can be easily integrated. Their
applications have been shown to be effective, producing
relatively small covering arrays in many cases. Particle swarm
optimization (PSO), a relatively new evolutionary algorithm,

has also been used in this area [13]–[16]. It is easy to
implement and has fast initial progress.
The conventional PSO (CPSO) algorithm was originally
designed to find optimal or near optimal solutions in a
continuous space. Nevertheless, many discrete PSO (DPSO)
algorithms and frameworks have been developed to solve
discrete problems [17]–[22]. For covering array generation,
current discrete methods [13]–[16] simply round the particle’s
position to an integer while keeping the velocity as a real
number. They suffer from two main shortcomings. First, the
performance of PSO is significantly impacted by its parameter
settings. In [23], effects of the general parameter selection and
initial population of PSO have been analyzed, but no guidelines on parameter settings have been reported for covering
array generation. Hence, a clear understanding of how to set
these execution parameters is needed. Second, simple rounding
fractional positions to integers introduces a substantial source
of errors in the search. Instead, a specialized DPSO version is
needed. Because current PSO methods show promise for generating covering arrays, these two main shortcomings should
be addressed.
In this paper, we adapt set-based PSO (S-PSO) [18] to
generate covering arrays. S-PSO utilizes set and probability
theories to develop a new representation scheme for combinatorial optimization problems as well as refining the related
evolution operators. In our adaptation of S-PSO, two auxiliary strategies are proposed to enhance performance, and
a novel DPSO algorithm is thus proposed. DPSO has the
same conceptual basis and exhibits similar search behavior to
CPSO, with parameters playing similar roles. Then, we explore
the optimal parameter settings for both CPSO and DPSO to
improve their performance, and identify recommended settings. Furthermore, because many CPSO variants [24]–[27]
can be easily extended to discrete versions based on our DPSO,
the performance of these discrete versions is also compared
with their original ones. Finally, we compare CPSO and DPSO
with existing GA and ACO [9], [11] algorithms to generate
covering arrays.
The main contributions of this paper are as follows.
1) Based on the set-based representation, we design a
version of S-PSO [18] for covering array generation.
2) We propose two auxiliary strategies, particle reinitialization, and additional evaluation of gbest, to enhance the
performance of PSO. A novel DPSO for covering array
generation is proposed.
3) We design experiments to explore the optimal parameter settings for CPSO and DPSO for covering array
generation.
4) We implement original and discrete versions of four
representative PSO variants (TVAC [24], CLPSO [25],
APSO [26], and DMS-PSO [27]) to compare their
efficacy for covering array generation.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section II
gives background on CT, covering array generation, and
the CPSO algorithm. Section III summarizes related work.
Section IV presents our DPSO algorithm, including the
representation scheme, related operators, and two auxiliary
strategies. Section V evaluates the performance of CPSO and

DPSO, and explores optimal parameter settings. Section VI
gives a comparison among CPSO, DPSO, and original and
discrete variants. Section VII compares CPSO and DPSO
with GA and ACO. Section VIII concludes this paper and
outlines future work.
II. BACKGROUND
A. CT
Suppose that the behavior of the software under test (SUT)
is controlled by n independent factors, which may represent configuration parameters, internal or external events, user
inputs, and the like. The ith factor has i discrete levels, chosen from the finite set Vi of size i . An n-tuple (x1 , x2 , . . . , xn )
forms a test case, where xi ∈ Vi for 1 ≤ i ≤ n.
Consider a simple e-commerce software system [15]. This
system consists of five different components. Each of these five
components can be regarded as a factor, and its configurations
can be regarded as different levels. Table I shows these five
factors and their corresponding levels. In this example, n = 5,
1 = 2 = 3 = 2, 4 = 5 = 3.
System failures are often triggered by interactions among
some factors, which can be represented by the combinations
of factor levels. In order to detect these failures, their combinations should be covered at least once by the test suite. A
t-way schema can be used to represent them.
Definition 1 (t-way schema): The n-tuple (−, y1 , . . . ,
yt , . . . ) is a t-way schema (t > 0) when some t factors
have fixed levels and the others can take any valid levels,
represented as “−.”
For example, suppose that when factor Payment Server
takes the level Master and factor Web Server takes the level
Apache, a system failure occurs. To detect this failure, the
2-way schema (Master, –, Apache, –, –) must be covered
at least once by the test suite. To simplify later discussion,
we use the index in the level set of each factor to present
a schema. For example, (0, –, 1, –, –) is used to represent
(Master, –, Apache, –, –).
Exhaustive testing covers all n-way schemas of the system; in our example, it uses 2 × 2 × 2 × 3 × 3 = 72 test
cases. Testing cost becomes prohibitive as the numbers of factors and levels increase. Moreover, because only interactions
among few factors are likely to trigger failures [2], testing
high-way schemas can lead to many uninformative test cases.
At the other extreme, if we only guarantee to cover each 1-way
schema once, only three test cases are needed (a single test
case can cover five 1-way schemas at most). But we may
fail to detect some interaction triggered failures involving two
factors.

Instead, CT covers all t-way schemas. Such a test suite is a
t-way covering array, with t being the covering strength. The
value of t determines the depth of coverage. It is a key setting
of CT, and should be decided by the testers. We give a precise
definition.
Definition 2 (Covering Array): If an N×n array, where N is
the number of test cases, has the following properties: 1) each
column i (1 ≤ i ≤ n) contains only elements from the set Vi
with i = |Vi | and 2) the rows of each N × t sub array cover
all |Vk1 | × |Vk2 | × . . . × |Vkt | combinations of the t columns at
least once, where t ≤ n and 1 ≤ k1 < . . . < kt ≤ n, then it is a
t-way covering array, denoted by CA(N; t, n, (1 , 2 , . . . , n )).
When 1 = 2 = . . . = n = , it is denoted by CA(N; t, n, ).
Reference [2] demonstrated that more than 70% failures can
be detected by a 2-way covering array, and almost all failures
can be detected by a 6-way covering array. Hence, using CT,
we can detect many failures of the system by applying relatively low strength covering arrays. In other words, CT can
greatly reduce the size of test suite while maintaining high
fault detection ability.
In the example of Table I, if we only consider the interactions between any two factors, only nine test cases are
required to construct a 2-way covering array instead of 72
for exhaustive testing. Table II shows a covering array, where
each row represents one test case. This table covers all possible 2-way schemas for any two factors corresponding to the
columns. For example, consider factor Payment Server and
User Browser, all 2×3 = 6 schemas, (Master, –, –, Firefox, –)
(Master, –, –, Explorer, –), (Master, –, –, Chrome, –),
(VISA, –, –, Firefox, –), (VISA, –, –, Explorer, –),
(VISA, –, –, Chrome, –), can be found in the table.
For convenience, if several groups of gi factors (gi < n) have
g
the same number of levels ak , ak i can be used to represent
these factors and their levels. Thus, the coveringarray can
g

g
gi = n,
be denoted by CA(N; t, a11 , a22 , . . . , ak k ) where
n
or CA(N; t, a ) when g1 = n and a1 = a. For example, the
covering array in Table II is a CA(9; 2, 23 32 ).
In many software systems, the impacts of the interactions
among factors are not uniform. Some interactions may be more
prone to trigger system failures, while other may have little or no impact on the system. To effectively detect these
different interactions, variable strength (VS) covering arrays
can be applied. This can offer different covering strengths

577

to different groups of factors, and can therefore provide a
practical approach to test real applications.
Definition 3 (VS Covering Array): A VS covering array,

denoted by VCA(N; t, a11 . . . akk , CA1 (t1 , bm
. . . bp p ), . . . ,

n
CAj (tj , cn11 . . . cqq )), is an N × n covering array of covering
strength t containing one or more sub covering arrays, namely
CA1 , . . . , CAj , each of which has covering strength t1 , . . . , tj
all larger than t.
Consider the e-commerce system shown in Table I. If the
interactions of three factors, Payment Server, Web Server, and
Business Database, have a higher probability to trigger system failures, then a VS covering array can be constructed.
As in Table II, only three more test cases (Table III) are
needed to construct the VCA(12; 2, 23 32 , CA(3, 22 31 )). With
these 12 test cases, not only are all 2-way schemas of all five
factors covered, but also all 3-way schemas of these three factors (Payment Server, Web Server, and Business Database) are
covered.
B. Covering Array Generation
Covering arrays are used as test suites in CT. Covering array
generation is the process of test suite construction. It is the
most active area in CT with more than 50% of research papers
focusing on this field [1]. Due to limited testing resources, all
aim to construct a minimal covering array while still maintaining full coverage of combinations. Computational methods
have been used widely for covering array generation because
they can be applied to any systems. In general, these methods
generate all possible combinations first. Then they generate
test cases to cover these combinations one-by-one. One-testat-a-time is the most widely used strategy among evolutionary
algorithms to generate a covering array.
The one-test-at-a-time strategy was popularized by
AETG [28] and was further used by Bryce and Colbourn [29].
This strategy takes the model of SUT(n, 1 , . . . , n ) where
n is the number of factors and i is the number of valid
levels of factor i, and the covering strength t as input. At
first, an empty test suite TS and a set S of t-way schemas
to be covered are initialized. In each iteration, a test case is
generated with the highest fitness value according to some
heuristic techniques. Then it is added to TS and the t-way
schemas covered by it are removed. When all the t-way
schemas have been covered, the final test suite TS is returned.
This process is shown in Algorithm 1.
In this strategy, a fitness function must be used to evaluate
the quality of a candidate test case (line 6 in Algorithm 1). It is
an important part of all heuristic techniques. In covering array
generation, the fitness function takes the test case as the input
and then outputs a fitness value representing its “goodness.”
It is defined as follows.

578

according to some heuristics
7:
Add p to the test suite TS
8:
Remove the t-way schemas covered by p from S
9: end while
10: return TS

Definition 4 (Fitness Function): Let TS be the generated
test set, and p be a test case. Then fitness(p) is the number of
uncovered t-way schemas in TS that are covered by p.
The fitness function can be formulated as
fitness(p) = |schemat ({p}) − schemat (TS)|

(1)

where schemat (TS) represents the set of all t-way schemas
covered by test set TS, and | · | stands for cardinality. When
all Cnt t-way schemas covered by p are not covered by TS,
the fitness function reaches the maximum value fitness(p) =
|schemat ({p})| = Cnt .
For example, consider the 2-way covering array generation
of the e-commerce system shown in Table II. Suppose that
TS consists of test cases (0, 0, 0, 0, 0) and (0, 0, 1, 1, 1).
The fitness function computes the fitness value for a candidate test case p = (1, 0, 1, 2, 2) as follows: because p covers
ten 2-way schemas, namely schema2 ({p}) = {(1, 0, –, –, –),
(1, –, 1, –, –,), (1, –, –, 2, –), (1, –, –, –, 2), (–, 0, 1, –, –),
(–, 0, –, 2, –), (–, 0, –, –, 2), (–, –, 1, 2, –), (–, –, 1, –, 2),
(–, –, –, 2, 2)} and TS only covers (–, 0, 1, –, –) in p, the
function returns fitness(p) = 9.
C. PSO
PSO is a swarm-based evolutionary computation technique.
It was developed by Kennedy et al. [30], inspired by the social
behavior of bird flocking and fish schooling. PSO utilizes a
population of particles as a set of candidate solutions. Each
of the particles represents a certain position in the problem
hyperspace with a given velocity. A fitness function is used
to evaluate the quality of each particle. Initially, particles are
distributed in the hyperspace uniformly. Then each particle
repeatedly updates its state according to the individual best
position in its history (pbest) and the current global best position (gbest). Eventually, each particle possibly moves toward
the direction of the individual optimum and global optimum,
and finds an optimal or near optimal solution.
Suppose that the problem domain is a D−dimensional
hyperspace. Then the position and velocity of particle i can
be represented by xi ∈ RD and vi ∈ RD respectively. CPSO
uses the following equations to update a particle’s velocity
and position, where vi,j (k) represents the jth component of the
velocity of particle i at the kth iteration, and xi,j (k) represents

its corresponding position:
vi,j (k + 1) = ω × vi,j (k) + c1 × r1,j × (pbesti,j − xi,j (k))
(2)
+ c2 × r2,j × (gbestj − xi,j (k))
xi,j (k + 1) = xi,j (k) + vi,j (k + 1).

(3)

The best position of particle i in its history is pbesti , and
gbest is the best position among all particles. The velocityupdate equation (2) captures the three basic concepts of PSO.
The first is inertia, the tendency of the particle to continue in
the direction it has been moving. The second is memory of
the best position ever found by itself. The third is cooperation
using the best position found by other particles.
The parameter ω is inertia weight. It controls the balance between exploration (global search state) and exploitation
(local search state). Two positive real numbers c1 and c2
are acceleration constants that control the movement tendency toward the individual and global best position. Most
studies set ω = 0.9, and c1 = c2 = 2 to get the best
balance [17], [31], [32]. In addition, r1,j and r2,j are two uniformly distributed random numbers in the range of [0.0, 1.0],
used to ensure the diversity of the population.
If the problem domain (the search space of particles) has
bounds, a bound handling strategy is adopted to keep the particles inside the search space. Many different strategies have
been proposed [33]. In the reflecting strategy, when a particle
exceeds the bound of the search space in any dimension, the
particle direction is reversed in this dimension to get back to
the search space. For example, in case of a dimension with
a range of values from 0 to 2, if a particle moves to 3, its
position is reversed to 1.
In addition, as the velocity can increase over time, a limit
is set on velocity to prevent an infinite velocity or invalid
position for the particle. Setting a maximum velocity, which
determines the distance of movement from the current position
to the possible target position, can reduce the likelihood of
explosion of the swarm traveling distance [31]. Generally, the
value of the maximum velocity is selected as i /2, where i
is the range of dimension i.
The pseudocode in Algorithm 2 presents the process of generating a test case by PSO. This algorithm can be invoked
by line 6 of Algorithm 1 to generate a test case for t-way
schemas. The n factors of the test case can be treated as an
n-dimensional hyperspace. A particle pi = (x1 , x2 , . . . , xn ) can
be regarded as a candidate test case. The fitness function is
that of Definition 4, the number of uncovered t-way schemas
in the generated test suite that are covered by particle pi . PSO
employs real numbers but the valid values are integers for covering array generation, so each dimension of particle’s position
can be rounded to an integer while maintaining the velocity
as a real number. This method is used in all prior research
applying PSO to covering array generation [13]–[16].
III. R ELATED W ORK
In this section, three different but related aspects are discussed. We first summarize search-based CT, especially the
current applications of PSO for covering array generation.
Then, we introduce prior research on discrete versions of PSO,

to improve CPSO for discrete problems. Finally, some PSO
variants are introduced. These try to enhance PSO for conventional continuous problems by adopting strategies that can
further improve covering array generation.
A. PSO in Search-Based CT
SBSE has grown quickly in recent years. Many problems
in software engineering have been formulated into searchbased optimization problems, and heuristic techniques have
been used to find solutions. Software testing is a major topic
in software engineering. Many heuristic techniques have also
been applied to this field, including functional testing, mutation testing, stress testing, temporal testing, CT, and regression
testing. Currently, many classic heuristic techniques, such as
SA [3]–[7], GA [8]–[10], and ACO [9], [11], [12] have been
applied to generate uniform and VS covering arrays
successfully.
PSO has also been applied to software testing.
Windisch et al. [34] applied PSO to structural testing,
and compared its performance with GA. They showed that
PSO outperformed GA for most cases in terms of effectiveness and efficiency. Ganjali [35] proposed a framework for
automatic test partitioning based on PSO, observing that PSO
performed better than other existing heuristic techniques.
PSO has been applied to covering array generation.
Ahmed and Zamli [15] proposed frameworks of PSO to generate different kinds of covering arrays, including t-way
(PSTG [14]) and VS-PSTG. Then they extended PSTG to support VS covering array generation [16]. Chen et al. [18] also

579

applied PSO to 2-way covering array generation. They further
used a test suite minimization algorithm to reduce the size of
the generated covering array.
Current applications of PSO for covering array generation
can yield smaller covering arrays than most greedy algorithms,
but they all apply the same rounding operator to the particle’s
position, and they lack guidelines on the parameter settings.
B. Discrete Versions of PSO
PSO was initially developed to solve problems in continuous
space, but PSO can also be applied to some discrete optimization problems including binary or general integer variables.
Many discrete versions of PSO have been proposed [17]–[22].
Chen et al. [18] classify existing algorithms into four
types.
1) Swap operator-based PSO [19] uses a permutation of
numbers as position and a set of swaps as velocity.
2) Space transformation-based PSO [20] uses various techniques to transform the position, defined as a vector of
real numbers, to the corresponding solution in discrete
space.
3) Fuzzy matrix-based PSO [21] defines the position and
velocity as a fuzzy matrix, and decode it to a feasible
solution.
4) Incorporating-based PSO [22] consists of hybrid methods incorporating some heuristic or problem dependent
techniques.
Chen et al. [18] also propose a S-PSO method based on
sets with probabilities, which we later adapt to represent a
particle’s velocity. S-PSO uses a set-based scheme to represent the discrete search space. The velocity is defined as
a set with probabilities, and the operators are all replaced
by procedures defined on the set. They extend some PSO
variants to discrete versions and test them on the traveling
salesman problem and the multidimensional knapsack problem. They show that the discrete version of CLPSO [25] can
perform better than other variants. S-PSO was found to characterize the combinatorial optimization problems very well.
Gong et al. [36] then employed such a set-based representation scheme for solving vehicle routing problems to obtain a
new method, S-PSO-VRPTW.
C. PSO Variants
The original PSO may become trapped in a local optimum.
In order to improve the performance, many variants have been
proposed [17], [24]–[27]. Chen et al. [37] classify these variants into four different groups. The first group of variants aims
to adjust the control parameters during the evolution, for example by decreasing inertia weight ω linearly from 0.9 to 0.4 over
the search process. The second group employs different neighborhood topologies. The basic local version of PSO makes
the particle learn from the local best position lbesti found by
particle i’s neighborhood instead of the global best position
gbest. RPSO and VPSO are two common versions which use
a ring topology and a Von Neumann topology, respectively.
The third group uses hybrid strategies with other search techniques. Many types of operators, such as genetic operators

580

TABLE IV
D IFFERENT G ROUPS OF DPSO AND PSO VARIANTS

(selection, crossover, and mutation), evolutionary computation
paradigms and biology inspired operators have been used. The
fourth uses multiswarm techniques. Several sets of swarms
optimize different components of the solution concurrently or
cooperatively.
In our experiments, four representative PSO variants are
included, as follows.
1) Ratnaweera et al. [24] proposed a typical variant of
the first group, TVAC, which uses a time varying
inertia weight and acceleration constant to adjust the
parameters.
2) Liang et al. [25] proposed the CLPSO method, a wellknown variant of the second group, which allows the
particle to learn from other particles’ individual best
positions in different dimensions.
3) Zhan et al. [26] proposed an adaptive PSO (APSO)
that can be seen as a variant of the third group. They
developed an evolutionary state estimation to adaptively control the parameter and used an elitist learning
strategy.
4) DMS-PSO [27], a variant of the fourth group, was proposed by Liang and Suganthan [27]. It is characterized
by a set of swarms with small sizes and these swarms
are frequently regrouped.
In summary, Table IV lists the different groups of discrete
versions of PSO and PSO variants.
IV. DPSO
In this section, a new DPSO for covering array generation
is presented. We firstly illustrate the weakness of CPSO with a
simple example. Then the representation scheme of a particle’s
velocity and the corresponding redefined operators are introduced. Finally, we give two auxiliary strategies to enhance the
performance of DPSO.
A. Example
In CPSO, a particle’s position represents a candidate test
case; its velocity, a real vector, represents the movement tendency of this particle in each dimension. This scheme is
meaningful in a continuous optimization problem, because
an optimal solution may exist near the current best particle’s
position. So it is desirable to move the particle to this area
for further search. This may not hold for covering array
generation.

Here, we use CA(N; 2, 34 ) as an example. Suppose that
three test cases (0, 1, 0, 1), (2, 1, 1, 2), and (1, 2, 0, 0) have
been generated and added to TS in Algorithm 1, and the fourth
one is to be generated according to CPSO. A possible candidate particle pi may have the position (0, 0, 0, 0) and velocity
(0.5, 0.6, −0.4, 0.2) with fitness value 4, and its individual
best position pbesti may be (0, 0, 1, 1) with fitness value 5.
The global best position gbest may be (0, 2, 2, 2) with fitness
value 6. According to the update (2), if we take ω = 0.9 and
c1 × r1 = c2 × r2 ≈ 0.65, in the next iteration, pi ’s velocity
may be transformed to (0.45, 1.84, 1.59, 2.13). Thus, pi moves
to the new position (0, 1, 1, 1) with a limitation on the velocity (the velocity is kept in [−i /2, i /2]), or (0, 1, 1, 2) with
no limitation. In both cases, pi only has fitness value 2 after
updating. When this occurs, pi evolves to a worse situation,
although its position is closer to the pbesti and gbest than its
original one.
Analyzing the fitness measurement, the main contribution
to the fitness value is the combinations that the test case can
cover, not the concrete “position” at which it is located. For
example, test case (2, 1, 1, 2) has a larger fitness value than
(0, 0, 0, 0) because it covers six new schemas [(2, 1, –, –),
(2, –, 1, –), (2, –, –, 2) etc.], not because of its relative distance
to other particles.
B. DPSO
To overcome this weakness, the movement of particles
should be modified. Inspired by the set-based representation scheme of velocity, DPSO is designed as a version of
S-PSO [18] to make the particle learn from the individual and
global best more effectively when generating covering arrays.
Unlike S-PSO, the element of the velocity set in DPSO is
designed for covering array generation, and DPSO does not
classify the velocity set into different dimensions to avoid the
inconsistency of different dimensions when updating velocities
in S-PSO.
In DPSO, a particle’s position represents a candidate test
case, while its velocity is changed to a set of t-way schemas
with probabilities. Other than the velocity’s representation and
the newly defined operators, the evolution procedure of DPSO
is the same as CPSO (Algorithm 2).
Definition 5 (Velocity): The velocity is a set of pairs
(s, p(s)), where s is a possible t-way schema of the covering
array and p(s) is a real number between 0 and 1 representing the probability of the selection of schema s to update the
current position.
In the initialization of the swarm, the particle’s position is
randomly assigned. Then Cnt possible different schemas are
selected randomly and each of them is assigned a random
probability p(s) ∈ (0, 1). These Cnt pairs form the initial velocity set of this particle; the size of this set changes dynamically
during the evaluation.
We consider the same example CA(N; 2, 34 ). In DPSO,
when particle pi is initialized, its position xi (k) may be
(0, 0, 0, 0) representing a candidate test case as before, and
its velocity vi (k) may be such a set {((1, 1, –, –), 0.7),
((0, –, 0, –), 0.3), ((–, 0, –, 1), 0.8), ((0, –, –, 2), 0.9),

pairs.
DPSO follows the conventional evolution procedure
(Algorithm 2) that uses (2) and (3) to update the velocity and
position of a particle. To adapt the new scheme for velocity
in Definition 5, the related operators in these equations must
be redefined.
1) Coefficient × Velocity: The coefficient is a real number
which may be a parameter or a random number. It modifies
all the probabilities in the velocity.
Definition 6 (Coefficient × Velocity): Let a be a nonnegative real number and v be a velocity, a × v = {(s, p(s) ×
a)|(s, p(s)) ∈ v}. (If p(s) × a > 1, p(s) × a = 1.)
For example, Fig. 1(a) shows the result for ω × vi (k) where
ω = 0.9.
2) Position–Position: The difference of two positions gives
the direction on which a particle moves. The results of the
minus operator is a set of (s, p(s)) pairs, as velocity.
Definition 7 (Position–Position): Let x1 and x2 be two positions. Then x1 − x2 = {(s, 0.5)|s is a schema that exists in x1
but not in x2 }.
In the newly generated schema, probability p(s) for s is
set to 0.5 so that the acceleration constants take similar
values in both CPSO and DPSO. As in (2), the result of
position–position is multiplied by ci × ri . In CPSO, ci is
often set to 2 and ri is a random number between 0 and 1
(recall Section II-C). In DPSO, we want the value of final
probability to have a range between 0 and 1 after multiplying
by ci . Setting p(s) to 0.5 puts the result in [0, 1] when ci = 2.
For example, suppose that xi (k) = (0, 0, 0, 0), pbesti =
(0, 0, 1, 1), and gbest = (0, 2, 2, 2) as before.
We can get pbesti − xi (k) = {((0, –, 1, –, –), 0.5),
((0, –, –, 1), 0.5), ((–, 0, 1, –), 0.5), ((–, 0, –, 1), 0.5),
((–, –, 1, 1), 0.5)}. Fig. 1(b) and (c) shows the results for
2×r1 ×(pbesti −xi (k)) and 2×r2 ×(gbest−xi (k)) respectively.
3) Velocity + Velocity: The addition of velocities gives a
particle’s movement path. The plus operator results in the
union of two velocities.
Definition 8 (Velocity + Velocity): Let v1 and v2 be two
velocities. Then v1 + v2 = {(s, p(s))| if (s, p1 (s)) ∈ v1 and
(s, p2 (s)) ∈ v2 , p(s) = p1 (s) + p2 (s); if (s, pi (s)) ∈ v1
and (s, pi (s)) ∈
/ v2 or (s, pi (s)) ∈ v2 and (s, pi (s)) ∈
/ v1 ,
p(s) = pi (s)}. (If p1 (s) + p2 (s) > 1, p1 (s) + p2 (s) = 1.)
For example, Fig. 1(d) shows the results for pi ’s new
velocity vi (k + 1) after updating velocity.

20: if γ < pro3 then
21:

22: end if

In the velocity-updating phase of DPSO (2), we introduce
a new parameter pro1 to control the size of the final velocity
set. If p(si ) < pro1 , the pair (si , p(si )) is removed from the
final velocity. For example, if we set pro1 = 0.5, vi (k + 1) is
removed as shown in Fig. 1(e). Here, the velocity has been
sorted in descending order of p(s), where if several p(s) have
the same value, they are in an arbitrary order. If vi (k + 1)
becomes empty, it stays empty until new pairs are added to
it. As long as the velocity is empty, the particle’s position is
not updated and no better solutions can be found from this
particle. In Section IV-C1, we discuss how to reinitialize this
particle.
4) Position+Velocity: Position plus velocity is the position
updating phase. Algorithm 3 gives the pseudo code of this
procedure. Here, two new parameters, pro2 and pro3 , numbers
in the range [0, 1], are introduced. pro2 is used to determine

582

IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON EVOLUTIONARY COMPUTATION, VOL. 19, NO. 4, AUGUST 2015

the probability of selecting each fixed level in schema s and
pro3 is a mutation probability to make the particle mutate
randomly.
An example helps to describe this procedure. We already
have pi ’s current position xi (k) = (0, 0, 0, 0), and its updated
velocity vi (k + 1) in descending order of p(s) as shown in
Fig. 1(e). We also assume that pro2 and pro3 are both set to
0.5. Each schema si here is selected to update the position
with probability p(si ). For the first pair ((0, –, –, 2), 1.0),
suppose that the random number α satisfies α < 1.0. Then,
for each fixed level of this pair, namely level 0 of the first
factor and level 2 of the fourth factor, its corresponding factor
has not been fixed in xi (k + 1). Suppose that we have the
first β < 0.5 but the second β > 0.5, the first factor will be
selected to update the position and the second factor will not.
So the new position becomes (0, –, –, –). For the second pair,
we regenerate the random number α, and compare it with the
probability 0.9. If α < 0.9, the second pair is selected. If we
generate β < 0.5 in two rounds, the new position becomes
(0, 2, 2, –). Accordingly, if the third pair is selected, and its
second factor’s level 0 is chosen to update, it does not change
position because this factor has been set to a fixed level 2.
This procedure is repeated until all factors in the new position
xi (k+1) are set to fixed levels. If all pairs in velocity have been
considered, unfixed factors of xi (k + 1) are filled by the same
levels of previous position xi (k). For example, after finishing
the For loop in line 15, if the fourth factor of xi (k + 1) has
not been given any level, the fourth factor of xi (k) is used to
update it. Then xi (k + 1) becomes (0, 2, 2, 0).
C. Auxiliary Strategies
Auxiliary strategies can be introduced to improve the performance of PSO. Two of them are added to DPSO: 1) particle
reinitialization to make the search more effective and 2) additional evaluation of gbest to improve the selection of the global
best test case.
1) Particle Reinitialization: The PSO algorithm starts with
a random distribution of particles, which finally converge.
Then the best position that has been found is returned. The
swarm may jump out of a local optimum, but this can not
be guaranteed because CPSO lacks specific strategies for this.
When applying PSO for covering array generation, increasing
the number of iterations does not improve the ability to escape
a local optimum. Hence, particle reinitialization, a widely used
method, is employed to help DPSO to jump out of the local
optimum.
The main issue with particle reinitialization is when to reinitialize the particle. We may select a threshold, so that the
reinitialization is done when the number of iterations exceeds
the threshold. In DPSO, a better method can be applied. Using
the new representation for velocity, when the current particle pi ’s position equals its individual best position pbesti
and global best position gbest, the size (norm) of pi ’s velocity reduces gradually, because no pairs are generated from
(pbesti − xi ) and (gbest − xi ), and the original pairs in velocity
are removed gradually under the influence of ω × v (reduce
the p(s) of original pairs) and parameter pro1 . After a few
fluctuations around gbest, the particle may stay at gbest, and

TABLE V
T WO D IFFERENT C ONSTRUCTIONS OF CA(N; 2, 34 )

its size (norm) of velocity is zero. We can use this scenario to
trigger reinitialization of the particle. When the reinitialization
is done, each dimension of a particle’s position is randomly
assigned a valid value, and its velocity is regenerated as in the
initialization of the swarm.
2) Additional Evaluation of gbest: Current PSO methods
to generate covering arrays generally employ the fitness function in Definition 4. This fitness function only focuses on
the current candidate, and does not consider the partial test
suite TS.
Consider the generation of CA(N; 2, 34 ). Table V shows two
different construction processes. Both constructions generate
(0, 0, 0, 0) as the first test case. Then they choose different test
cases, but each of the first three reaches the largest number of
newly covered combinations, C42 = 6. The difference between
these two constructions emerges when generating the fourth
test case. In Construction 1, because the combinations with the
same level between any two factors have all been covered, we
cannot find a new test case that can still cover six combinations. However, in Construction 2, such a new test case can be
found, (1, 0, 1, 2). Because the minimum size of CA(N; 2, 34 )
is 9, each test case is required to cover six new combinations.
Thus, Construction 1 cannot generate the minimum test suite,
but Construction 2 can.
In general, there may exist multiple test cases with the same
highest fitness value, which make them equally qualified to be
gbest in Algorithm 2. Instead of arbitrarily selecting one as
gbest, it is better to apply additional distance metric to select
one among them. As shown in Table V, if the new test case
is similar to the existing tests [as (0, 1, 1, 1) is closer to
(0, 0, 0, 0) than (1, 1, 1, 1)], there may be a better chance to
find test cases with larger fitness subsequently.
In order to measure the “similarity” between a test case t
and an existing test suite TS, we use the average Hamming
distance. The Hamming distance d12 indicates the number of
factors that have different levels between two test cases t1 and
t2 . Hence, the similarity between t and TS can be defined by
the average Hamming distance
H(t, TS) =

1 
dtk .
|TS|

(4)

k∈TS

The new gbest selection strategy selects the best candidate gbest based on two metrics. A test case that has the
minimum average Hamming distance (i.e., the maximum similarity) from the set of test cases that all have the same highest
fitness value is selected as gbest in Algorithm 2. For example, when we generate the second test case for CA(N; 2, 34 )
in Table V, although (1, 1, 1, 1) and (0, 1, 1, 1) both have
the highest fitness value 6, (0, 1, 1, 1) is selected as gbest

WU et al.: A DISCRETE PARTICLE SWARM OPTIMIZATION FOR COVERING ARRAY GENERATION

583

TABLE VI
C OMPARING P ERFORMANCE B ETWEEN CPSO AND DPSO

because its average Hamming distance, 3, is smaller than that
of (1, 1, 1, 1), 4. We expect that this additional evaluation can
enhance the probability of generating a smaller test suite. In
addition, because we still want to make the particle follow the
conventional search behavior on the individual best direction,
this additional distance metric will not be used in updating the
pbest of DPSO.
V. E VALUATION AND PARAMETER T UNING
In this section, we first evaluate the effectiveness of DPSO
in some representative cases, and compare the results against
CPSO. Then the optimal parameter settings for both CPSO
and DPSO are explored. The goal of evaluation and parameter
tuning is to make the size of generated covering array as small
as possible. Five representative cases of covering arrays, listed
below, are selected for our experiments
CA1 (N; 2, 610 )

CA2 (N; 3, 57 )

CA3 (N; 4, 39 )

CA4 (N; 2, 43 53 62 ) VCA(N; 2, 315 , CA(3, 34 )).
We consider four independent parameters, iteration number
(iter), population size (size), inertia weight (ω), and acceleration constant (c), which play similar roles in both CPSO
and DPSO, and three new parameters for DPSO, pro1 , pro2 ,
and pro3 . We carry out a base choice experiment to study the
impact of various values of these parameters on CPSO and
DPSO’s performance and find the recommended settings for
them. First, a base setting is chosen as the basic configuration. Then the value of each parameter is changed to create
a series of configurations, while leaving the other parameters
unchanged. Initially, we set iter = 50, size = 20, ω = 0.9,
c = 1.3, and pro1 = pro2 = pro3 = 0.5 as a basic configuration based on the previous studies [13], [16] and our
empirical experience. To obtain statistically significant results,
the generation of each case of covering array is executed
30 times.
A. Evaluation of DPSO
We compare the performance between CPSO and DPSO
with the basic configuration. Five classes of covering arrays
are generated by these two algorithms. The sizes obtained and
average execution time per test case are shown as CPSO1 and
DPSO in Table VI. The best and mean array sizes of DPSO are
all better than those of CPSO1 . The new discrete representation scheme and auxiliary strategies improve PSO for covering
array generation.
DPSO can produce smaller covering arrays than CPSO with
the basic configuration. However, DPSO spends more time

during the evolution, because its new operators for updating
are more intricate than the conventional ones. DPSO needs
to deal with many elements of the velocity set, whereas the
conventional scheme only needs simple arithmetic operations.
To compare the performance between CPSO and DPSO given
the same execution time, for each case we let the execution
time per test case for CPSO equal to that for DPSO, so that
CPSO can spend more time in searching. We refer to this
version of CPSO as CPSO2 . In addition, a t-test between
CPSO2 and DPSO is conducted and the corresponding p-value
is presented. A p-value smaller than 0.05 indicates that the performance of these two algorithms is statistically different with
95% confidence.
From CPSO1 , CPSO2 , and DPSO in Table VI, the performance of CPSO is improved with more search time. DPSO,
which must use fewer iterations, still works better than CPSO.
The effectiveness of DPSO comes from the essential improvement of its new representation scheme for velocity and the
auxiliary strategies. The results of the t-test demonstrate the
significance of these differences. Therefore, we can conclude
that DPSO performs better than CPSO with fewer iterations
for covering array generation.
B. Parameter Tuning
In the base choice experiment, because the sizes of the various covering arrays differ, the mean size of each case (si )
obtained is normalized using
si =

si − smin
.
smax − smin

This normalization enables the graphical representation of
different cases on a common scale.
Because some parameters may not significantly impact the
performance, we use ANOVA (significance level = 0.05) to
test whether there exist significant differences among the mean
results obtained by different parameter settings. When changing the parameter settings have no significant impact on the
generation results, these results will be presented as dotted
lines in the corresponding figures. For example, CA4 is presented as a dotted line in Fig. 2(b). It means that the iteration
number does not significantly impact the generation of this
case of covering array, and so this case will not be further
considered when identifying the optimal settings.
1) Iteration Number (iter): Iteration number determines the
number of updates. PSO typically requires thousands of iterations to evolve. Nevertheless, only a few iterations are required
to generate covering array according to [14]–[16]. So we

change its value from 50, the base setting, to 1950 incrementally. Much larger values are not used because the execution
time may increase markedly without a commensurate increase
in the quality of the results.
Fig. 2 shows the results for different choices of iteration numbers, where each line represents a covering array.
Performance is improved with increasing iterations for both
CPSO and DPSO. A small number of iterations may not be
appropriate due to insufficient searching. Because the optimal
settings are different among different cases, and several settings can be chosen to generate the minimum covering arrays,
it is open to debate which setting is the “best” one. Given
time constraints, for a population size of 20, a good setting
of iteration number could be approximately 1000 for both
CPSO and DPSO.
2) Population Size (Size): Population size determines the
initial search space. Generally a small value, e.g., 20, is satisfactory for most cases. A large population size may bring a
higher diversity and find a better solution, but it also increases
the evolving time. For the same reason as before, we change
the value of population size from 10 to 100.

Fig. 3 shows the results for different choices of population size. There is no doubt that the mean array size obtained
decreases as population size increases. A large population size
can have more chances to generate smaller covering arrays, but
its execution time can become prohibitive.
In addition, because iteration number and population size
together determine the search effort of PSO, we explore the
combinations between these two parameters. We let iter × size
be a constant 20 000, and generate each case under different
settings of these two parameters. Fig. 4 shows the results,
where PSO prefers a relatively larger population size. In
CPSO, ten particles with 2000 iterations is the worst setting,
and most cases produce good results with 60 or 80 particles.
In DPSO, the best choice of population size is still 80. In
both CPSO and DPSO, the largest population size 100 cannot
produce as good results as that of 80 due to having fewer iterations. So achieving smallest covering arrays requires a good
balance between these two parameters, and a moderately large
population size is necessary for both CPSO and DPSO. Thus,
we can set iteration number to 250, and population size to 80,
as the recommended settings for both CPSO and DPSO.

3) Inertia Weight (ω): Inertia weight determines the tendency of the particle to continue in the same direction. A
small value help the particle move primarily toward the best
position, while a large one is helpful to continue its previous
movement. A linearly decreasing value is also used as it can
make the swarm gradually narrow the search space. Here, we
investigate both fixed values and a linearly decreasing value
from 0.9 to 0.4 over the whole evolution (presented as “dec”).
Fig. 5 shows the results for different choices of inertia
weight. In CPSO, most of the smallest covering arrays are
generated by large fixed inertia weights. The decreasing value
does not perform as well as the large values, such as 0.9 for
CA1 , CA2 , and CA4 . So 0.9 can be the recommended choice
for CPSO. In DPSO, 1.1 is the worst choice because the particle may update its position based on its own velocity and
thus fail to learn from individual and global best positions.
The decreasing value can perform reasonably well, but a fixed
value 0.5 may be a better choice in that it keeps the effort of
global search moderate. Thus, we can recommend the fixed
inertia weight of 0.9 for CPSO, and 0.5 for DPSO.
4) Acceleration Constant (c): Acceleration Constants
c1 and c2 control the learning from pbest and gbest, respectively. Generally, they are set to the same value to balance

TABLE VII
R ECOMMENDED PARAMETER S ETTINGS

the influence of these two positions. Setting c1 and c2 to a
large value may make the particle more likely attracted to the
best position ever found, while a small one may make the
search far from the current optimal region. In this paper, we
set c1 = c2 = c, and vary c from 0.1 to 2.9.
Fig. 6 shows the results for different choices of acceleration
constant. Unlike other parameters, there is a consistent trend in
all five cases. In CPSO, the values larger than 0.5 all produce
good results. In DPSO, 1.3 can definitely be regarded as the
optimal value. Thus, we set 1.3 as the recommended value of
acceleration constant for both CPSO and DPSO.
5) pro1 , pro2 , and pro3 : These three parameters are new to
DPSO. Parameter pro1 determines the size of the final velocity. As those pairs whose probabilities are smaller than pro1
are removed from the final velocity set, a small value may
keep more pairs in the velocity for the next evolution, but it

586

IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON EVOLUTIONARY COMPUTATION, VOL. 19, NO. 4, AUGUST 2015

TABLE VIII
S IZES (N) OF C OVERING A RRAYS FOR n FACTORS , E ACH H AVING T HREE L EVELS , W ITH C OVERING S TRENGTH t, CA(N; t, n, 3)

also requires more computation time. Parameter pro2 determines the probability of selecting each fixed level from each
schema when updating positions. A larger value may lead to
a quick construction of new position, but it may also lead
to fast convergence toward a local optimum. Parameter pro3
determines the mutation probability when updating positions.
A larger value may enhance the randomness, but it also lowers
the convergence speed. In this paper, values from 0.1 to 1.0
for these three parameters are investigated.
Fig. 7 shows the results. For pro1 , a large value is not
appropriate because it removes nearly all pairs from the final
velocity set. A medium value 0.5, which appears to lead to the
best result, may be the best choice. For pro2 , the smallest value
0.1 yields the best results. Slower construction of the new position may slow the convergence toward a local optimum, but it
also takes longer. So, in order to balance performance and execution time, we take 0.3 as the recommended value for pro2 .
For pro3 , a larger value may be a good choice. The frequent
mutation of new position may bring better results, but also
takes longer to converge. So, we take 0.7 as the recommended
value for pro3 .
In summary, the recommended parameter settings for PSO
for covering array generation are different from previously
suggested ones [13], [16]. Some parameters may significantly
impact the performance in some cases, and parameter tuning is necessary to enhance heuristic techniques for particular
applications. Naturally, the optimal settings vary for different cases of covering arrays. There may not exist a common
setting that can always lead to the best results. Because it is

impractical to tune parameters for each case in real life, we
suggest two general settings for CPSO and DPSO, as shown
in Table VII, which can typically lead to better performance
within reasonable execution time.
VI. C OMPARING A MONG PSO S
In this section, we compare the best reported array sizes
generated by PSO in [16] with our findings for CPSO, DPSO,
and four representative variants. Because the research in [16]
demonstrated that their generation results typically outperform
greedy algorithms, in this paper, we do not compare CPSO and
DPSO with greedy algorithms.
We implement both the original and discrete versions of
four variants (TVAC [24], CLPSO [25], APSO [26], and
DMS-PSO [27]) to generate covering arrays. Their discrete
versions are extended based on new representation scheme of
velocity and auxiliary strategies. We name them D-TVAC, DCLPSO, D-APSO, and D-DMS-PSO, respectively. In CLPSO,
a particle can learn from different particles’ pbest in each
dimension whereas we do not distinguish dimensions strictly
in DPSO. So in D-CLPSO, a particle can fully learn from
different particles’ pbest in all dimensions. That may weaken
the search ability of CLPSO. For the other three variants, they
can be directly extended based on DPSO.
All algorithms are compared using the same number of
fitness function evaluations. CPSO and DPSO use the recommended settings shown in Table VII. For the variants, iter,
size and pro1 , pro2 and pro3 for discrete versions are set to

their recommended values. ω and c are also set to recommended values unless they are adaptively adjusted during the
evolution, in which case their range is set to [0.4, 0.9] and
[0.8, 1.8], respectively. The new control parameters for these
variants follow their suggested settings.
Tables VIII–XIII give the results. Because of the execution
time, we only consider covering strengths from 2 to 4, and the
generation of each covering array is repeated 30 times. A t-test
(significance level = 0.05) is also conducted to test whether
there exists a significant difference between the mean sizes
produced by the two algorithms. In the first three columns, we
report the best and mean array sizes obtained from previous
results, CPSO and DPSO, where boldface numbers indicate
that the difference between CPSO and DPSO is significant
based on the t-test. In the last four columns, we report the mean
array sizes from the original and discrete versions of each PSO
variant (presented as meanc and meand respectively), where
boldface numbers indicate that the difference between meanc
and meand of each variant is significant.
A. Uniform Covering Arrays
Tables VIII–X present the results for uniform covering
arrays. We extend the cases considered in [16], where “–”
indicates the not available cases. In Tables VIII, we report
array sizes for n factors, each having three levels. In
Tables IX and X, we report array sizes for 7 and 10 factors,
each having  levels. Their covering strengths all range from
2 to 4.
Typically, CPSO can produce smaller sizes than those
reported in [16], demonstrating the effectiveness of parameter tuning. Furthermore, DPSO can produce the smallest best
and mean sizes in almost all cases, and usually the performance of DPSO is significantly better than CPSO. When the
covering strength t = 2 is adopted (Table VIII), DPSO does

not generally outperform CPSO. But when covering strength
increases, DPSO performs better. Sometimes the mean sizes
for DPSO are smaller than the best sizes for CPSO. Because
generating a covering array with higher covering strength is
more complicated, DPSO may be more appropriate for generating such covering arrays. In Tables IX and X, we also find
that DPSO is superior for covering arrays with high covering strength. Overall, these results show the effectiveness of
DPSO for uniform covering array generation.
Surprisingly, DPSO does not beat previous results for
CPSO when covering arrays have two levels for each factor
(Table IX). This appears to be a weakness of DPSO. Although
DPSO generates smaller covering arrays than previous results
and CPSO, other techniques may still yield better results than
DPSO (some best known sizes can be found in [38]).
B. VS Covering Array
Tables XI–XIII give the results for VS covering arrays.
Based on CA(N; 2, 315 ), CA(N; 3, 315 ), and CA(N; 2, 42 52 63 ),
some different cases of sub covering arrays conducted in [16]
are examined. Their covering strengths are at most 4.
Generally, we can draw similar conclusions as for uniform
covering arrays. CPSO with the suggested parameter setting
can produce better results than reported sizes in some cases.
DPSO also usually beats them on the best and mean sizes.
In Table XI, often the difference between CPSO and DPSO
is not significant. In part this is because for the CA(3, 33 ),
CA(3, 33 )2 , CA(3, 33 )3 , and CA(4, 34 ), the same best results
are provably the minimum (e.g., the minimum size of the
CA(3, 33 ) is 3 × 3 × 3 = 27). For the other cases, although
sometimes the difference is not significant, DPSO can still generate smaller covering arrays. DPSO remains a good choice
for generating VS covering arrays. In Tables XII and XIII,
similar results can be found.

For both uniform and variable cases of covering arrays,
parameter tuning can enhance CPSO to generate smaller covering arrays than previous work. DPSO can produce the smallest
covering arrays in nearly all cases, and in general the difference of performance between CPSO and DPSO is significant.
DPSO is an effective discrete version of PSO for covering
array generation.
C. PSO Variants
In order to further investigate the effectiveness of DPSO for
covering array generation, we implement the original versions
of four representative variants of PSO and extend them to their
discrete versions based on DPSO. We apply them to generate

the same cases for covering arrays. The mean sizes obtained
are shown in the last four columns in Tables VIII–XIII.
We first compare the mean sizes of original PSO variants
with those of CPSO and DPSO. In our experiments, TVAC’s
mean sizes are always larger than CPSO’s. The linear adjustment of inertia weight and acceleration constant is not helpful
for CPSO for covering array generation. Typically, APSO’s
mean sizes are also larger than CPSO’s. Because APSO uses
a fuzzy system to classify different evolutionary states, its
ineffectiveness may result from inappropriate parameter settings. CLPSO and DMS-PSO can outperform CPSO typically.
Although on occasion they achieve comparable performance
with DPSO, they cannot perform as well as DPSO in most

cases. That further demonstrates the effectiveness of DPSO
for covering array generation. Because these four algorithms
are representative PSO variants (as shown in Table IV), designing different neighborhood topologies and using multiswarm
techniques may have potential to improve CPSO for covering
array generation.
We next compare the original and discrete versions of each
variant. Except for CLPSO, the other three variants can be
improved using their discrete versions, and the improvement
is also significant. TVAC cannot outperform CPSO, but it
is enhanced by DPSO so that D-TVAC can produce smaller
mean sizes than CPSO in most cases. The linear adjustment
is helpful for the discrete version. For CLPSO, only in a few
cases is it improved by DPSO. Sometimes D-CLPSO even
leads to worse results (see Table X), due primarily to the
weakened search ability of its discrete version as explained in
Section VI. For APSO, DPSO can enhance its original version,
but D-APSO is still worse than DPSO. That may result from
inappropriate settings as explained before. For DMS-PSO,
sometimes DPSO does not enhance it (see Table XI).
However, in most cases D-DMS-PSO can outperform
DMS-PSO and has comparable performance with D-TVAC.
The multiswarm strategy is also helpful for the discrete
version.

In summary, the comparison study reveals that our suggested parameter settings are more suitable for covering array
generation. DPSO is an effective discrete version of PSO.
It can significantly outperform previous results and CPSO
in nearly all cases for uniform and VS covering arrays.
Furthermore, DPSO’s representation scheme of a particle’s
velocity and auxiliary strategies not only enhance CPSO, but
also typically enhance PSO variants. DPSO is a promising
improvement on PSO for covering array generation.
VII. C OMPARING DPSO W ITH GA AND ACO
Because GAs and ACO [8]–[12] have also been successfully
used for covering array generation, we compare CPSO and
DPSO with the reported array sizes in [9] and [11]. There are
no widely accepted benchmarks for the comparison of searchbased covering array generation, so we only consider these
two representative and competitive works.
Shiba et al. [9] applied both GA and ACO to generate
uniform covering arrays (CA1 to CA8 in Table XIV), and
Chen et al. [11] applied ACO to generate VS covering arrays
(VCA9 to VCA12 in Table XIV). They both set algorithm
parameters according to recommendations in related research
fields without parameter tuning, while our CPSO and DPSO

590

IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON EVOLUTIONARY COMPUTATION, VOL. 19, NO. 4, AUGUST 2015

use the recommended settings shown in Table VII. To compare
these algorithms under the same number of fitness evaluations, for each case of covering array, the population size and
the number of iterations of CPSO and DPSO are modified
accordingly to satisfy the settings in [9] and [11]. Moreover,
Shiba et al. [9] and Chen et al. [11] both applied test minimization algorithms to further reduce the size of generated
covering arrays, while our CPSO and DPSO do not apply any
minimization algorithms.
Table XIV shows the comparison results, where boldface
numbers indicate the best array sizes obtained, and “–” represents that the corresponding data is not available. The
generation of each case of covering array of CPSO and DPSO
is executed 30 times and the best and average results are
presented. Because we do not implement GA and ACO for
covering array generation, no statistical tests can be conducted
here. In addition, because the platforms used for collecting the
results differ, the comparison of computational time would not
be informative. We nevertheless present the execution times
of our CPSO and DPSO, which can serve as references for
practitioners.
From Table XIV, DPSO can outperform existing GA and
ACO for covering array generation, despite the latter two
applying test minimization algorithms. Because our DPSO is
a version of PSO designed and tuned for covering array generation, it suggests that tuned versions of GAs and ACOs may
be a promising area for further study. In addition, CPSO performs worse than GA and ACO in seven of 12 cases. That
may result from the improvement by minimization algorithms
in [9] and [11]. But for CA2 , CA3 , and CA6 , CPSO can still
achieve smaller covering arrays.
In summary, the results further demonstrate that DPSO is
an effective discrete version of PSO for covering array generation. Further investigations of tuned versions of GA and ACO
should be considered.
VIII. C ONCLUSION
Covering array generation is a key issue in CT. We developed a new DPSO for covering array generation, by adapting
S-PSO to generate covering arrays and incorporating two
auxiliary strategies to improve the performance. Parameter tuning was applied to both CPSO and DPSO to identify their
best parameter settings. The original and discrete versions of
four representative PSO variants were implemented and their
efficacy for covering array generation was compared. The performance of DPSO was also compared with other existing
evolutionary algorithms, GA and ACO.
DPSO can perform better than CPSO with fewer iterations, and the performance of CPSO and DPSO is significantly
impacted by their parameter settings. Different cases require
different parameter settings; there may not exist a single choice
that leads to the best results. After parameter tuning, we identified two recommended settings, which lead to relatively good
performance for CPSO and DPSO. Indeed, CPSO with our recommended parameter settings improves on previously reported
results, and our DPSO with recommended parameter settings usually beats CPSO. Typically, DPSO also significantly

enhances the performance of PSO variants. In addition, DPSO
often outperforms GA and ACO to generate covering arrays.
Consequently, DPSO is a promising improvement of PSO for
covering array generation.
Improvements on the methods here may be possible in
a number of ways. One would be to investigate further
evolution procedures and strategies proposed in PSO, such
as hybridizing with penalty approaches to handle discrete
unknowns [39], and compare the results with some exact
schemes like branch and bound method. A second would be
to examine one-column-at-a-time approaches or methods that
construct the entire array, rather than the one-row-at-a-time
approach adopted here. A third would be to incorporate
DPSO with other methods, in particular with test minimization
methods.

Abstract The In-Parameter-Order (IPO) algorithm is a widely used strategy for the construction of software test suites
for combinatorial testing (CT) whose goal is to reveal faults triggered by interactions among parameters. Variants of IPO
have been shown to produce test suites within reasonable amounts of time that are often not much larger than the smallest
test suites known. When an entire test suite is executed, all faults that arise from t-way interactions for some fixed t are
surely found. However, when tests are executed one at a time, it is desirable to detect a fault as early as possible so that
it can be repaired. The basic IPO strategies of horizontal and vertical growth address test suite size, but not the early
detection of faults. In this paper, the growth strategies in IPO are modified to attempt to evenly distribute the values of
each parameter across the tests. Together with a reordering strategy that we add, this modification to IPO improves the
rate of fault detection dramatically (improved by 31% on average). Moreover, our modifications always reduce generation
time (2 times faster on average) and in some cases also reduce test suite size.

Introduction

Modern software systems are highly configurable.
Their behavior is controlled by many parameters. Interactions among these parameters may cause severe
failures, resulting in poor reliability. Therefore, software testing and reliability assessment are crucial in
the design of effective software, as discussed in [1-3] for
reliability and in [4-15] for software testing. Software
testing serves two main purposes: 1) to ensure that
software has as few errors as possible prior to release,
and 2) to detect and isolate faults in the software. A
generic model of such a software system identifies a finite set of parameters, and a finite set of possible values

for each parameter. Faults may arise due to a choice
of a value for a single parameter, interactions among
the values of a subset of the parameters, or a result
of environmental conditions not included in the software model. We focus on the faults that arise from
the parameters identified and the interactions among
them. It is nearly always impractical to exhaustively
test all combinations of parameter values because of resource constraints. Fortunately, this is not necessary
in general: in some real software systems, more than
70 percent of faults are caused by interactions between
two parameters[16], and all known faults are caused by
interactions among six or fewer parameters[17-18] .

For these reasons, combinatorial testing (CT) or tway testing chooses a strength t (the largest number of
parameters interacting to cause a fault), and forms a
software interaction test suite as follows. Every row of
the test suite is a test or a test case. For each parameter
in the system, each test specifies an admissible value for
the parameter. The defining property is that, no matter
how one chooses t parameters and an admissible value
for each (a t-way interaction), at least one test has the
specified parameters set to the indicated values. This
coverage property ensures that every possible interaction among t or fewer parameter values must arise in
at least one of the test cases. CT has proved to be an
efficient testing technique for software[6,9,19]. Indeed,
empirical studies have shown that t-way testing can effectively detect faults in various applications[17-18,20-22] .
A primary objective in producing a test suite is to
minimize the cost of executing the tests; hence minimizing the number of tests is desired. At the same
time, however, the time to produce the test suite is
also crucial. Hence the most effort has been invested
in finding a variety of test suite generation algorithms.
Some invest additional computational resources in minimizing the size of the test suite, while others focus
on fast generation methods for test suites of acceptable but not minimum size. General methods providing fast generation have primarily involved greedy
algorithms[9]. One-test-at-a-time methods start with
an empty test suite, and keep track of the as-yetuncovered t-way interactions. Then repeatedly a test
is selected, which attempts to maximize the number of
such interactions that are covered by the test, until all
interactions are covered. This strategy was pioneered in
AETG[23] , and later proved to be within a constant factor of the optimal size[24-25] . In practice, maintaining
a list of all t-way interactions can be prohibitive when
the number of parameters is large. One-parameter-ata-time methods instead construct a test suite for t of
the parameters (this contains all of the possible tests).
Then it repeatedly adds a new parameter, and chooses
a value for this parameter in each of the existing tests
(horizontal growth). Because it is possible that some
t-way interactions involving the new parameter have
not been covered yet, further tests are selected to cover
all such interactions (vertical growth). This requires
maintaining a list of (t − 1)-way interactions, and hence
can involve less bookkeeping. The pioneering example here is IPO[26] and its extensions, IPOG[27] , and
IPOG-F and IPOG-F2[28], which will be discussed in
more detail in Section 2. Both strategies typically pro-

duce test suites of acceptable size[26,29] . It has been observed that one-test-at-a-time methods produce slightly
smaller test suites in general, while one-parameter-ata-time methods are somewhat faster at generation[26].
As mentioned earlier, software interaction test suites
serve as two complementary roles[30]: to verify that no
t-way interaction of SUT (software under test) causes a
fault, or to locate such a fault. These two roles are
different: certifying absence of a fault requires running the whole test suite, while locating a fault may
not. Indeed in [30], it is shown that minimum test
suite size is not the correct objective for fault location;
the structure of the test suite can be more important
than its size alone. An improved rate of fault detection can provide faster feedback to testers[31] . Recent
studies have shown that CT is an effective fault detection technique and that early fault detection can
be improved by reordering the generated test suites
using interaction-based prioritization approaches[32-34] .
Many strategies have been proposed to guide prioritization using evaluation measures such as interaction
coverage based prioritization[30,35-39] and incremental
interaction coverage based prioritization[40-41] . In [30],
an evaluation measure of the expected time to fault detection is given.
Test case prioritization techniques have been explored for the one-test-at-a-time methods, but little is known for the one-parameter-at-a-time methods.
Bryce et al.[35-36,42] presented techniques
that combine generation and prioritization. Pure
prioritization[32-34,39] instead reorders an existing interaction test suite, using the metric of normalized average
percentage of faults detected (NAPFD). However, existing pure prioritization techniques use explicit fault
measurements of real systems, and hence are not directly suitable for the IPO algorithm.
The main contributions of our work are:
1) We modify the IPO algorithm in order to accelerate the method and make it effective for fault detection. Our modifications attempt to make the values of
each parameter more evenly distributed during generation. We focus on choosing values for the extension to
an additional parameter during the horizontal growth
of the algorithm and filling values for don’t care positions. (See Section 3.)
2) We develop a pure prioritization technique (a reordering strategy) for the IPO algorithm based on the
evaluation measure presented in [30]. Our method can
reduce the expected time to fault detection effectively.

vertical growth. During both horizontal and vertical
growth, it frequently happens that the value for one
or more parameters in a row can be chosen arbitrarily
without affecting the coverage of the row. Such entries
are don’t care positions[26] in the test suite. The IPO
methods exploit the fact that selecting values for don’t
care positions can be deferred; then they can be filled
during horizontal growth when the next parameter is
introduced. Every variant of IPO must therefore deal
with two basic problems:
• choose values for the new parameter to maximize
the number of uncovered interactions covered during
horizontal growth;
• assign values for don’t care positions that arise.
In the next section, we explore an implementation
of this IPO framework in which the objective is not
just to ensure coverage, but also to attempt to make
each value appear as equally often as possible for each
parameter. The latter is a balance condition.

3) We conduct experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of the modifications (see Section 5). We
conclude that the modifications to the IPO strategy result in faster generation (2 times faster on average according to the experimental results in Subsection 5.1),
sometimes in smaller test suites, and together with the
pure prioritization, in less time to detect the first fault
(improved by 31% on average according to the experimental results in Subsection 5.2).

Framework of the IPO Algorithm

IPO comprises a family of methods of the oneparameter-at-a-time type. We focus on IPOG as a representative implementation. The basic operation is to
add a new parameter to an existing interaction test
suite of strength t. To initialize the method, whenever
the number of parameters is at most t, all possible rows
are included, which is necessary and sufficient to obtain
a test suite.
Thereafter, to introduce a new parameter, the set π
of all t-way interactions involving the new parameter is
computed. Horizontal growth adds a value of the new
parameter to each existing row so that this extended
row covers the most interactions in π; the interactions
covered are removed from π. Then if π still contains
uncovered interactions, vertical growth adds new rows
to cover them. This process is outlined in the flowchart
in Fig.1.
Existing variants of the IPO strategy alter the selection of values for the new parameter during horizontal growth and the selection of additional rows during

3

Balance in the IPO Algorithm

A test suite must cover all t-way interactions. Consider a specific parameter and the t-way interactions
that contain it. For each value of the parameter, the
numbers of these t-way interactions with each different
value of the parameter are the same. Now consider the
frequencies of values of the parameter within the tests
of a test suite. Because each value must provide the
coverage of the same number of interactions, it appears
to be reasonable to attempt to make the frequencies

close to equal. The same argument applies to fault detection.
Two issues arise. First, current IPO algorithms do
not make any explicit effort to balance the frequencies
of values. Second, it is not at all clear how such an objective might affect the sizes of test suites produced, or
the time to generate them, or their rates of fault detection. In this section, we develop modifications of IPO
to address frequencies of values. Subsequent sections
treat their impacts.

While shown in Algorithm 1 for IPOG, this simple
strategy can also be used in IPOG-F and IPOG-F2. We
show the modification for IPOG-F. The IPOG-F algorithm greedily selects over both the row and the value
with which the covering array is extended, and the extended row/value pair (i; a) is greedily selected by the
following formula[28] :

3.1

where n is the number of parameters, Tc [i; a] denotes
the t-tuples that have previously been covered by already extended rows, and tn denotes the number of new
t-tuples the row/value pair would cover if we extend row
i with value a. The metric of optimal selection for the
extended row (i; a) is that the extended row (i; a) would
maximize tn .
The original pseudo-code for horizontal growth in
IPOG-F is shown in Algorithm 2. The modification
replaces line 6 to line 10 of Algorithm 2 as shown in
Algorithm 3. Similar modifications can be applied to
IPOG-F2.

Choosing a New Parameter’s Values

During horizontal growth, the IPOG algorithm
chooses to add a value of the new parameter to cover
the greatest number of interactions in π. In many situations, more than one value achieves this goal, and we
must choose one. A naive strategy treats the values as
ordered, and selects the smallest value that covers the
most interactions in π. This introduces a bias towards
the smaller values of each parameter, sometimes resulting in smaller values appearing much more frequently
than larger ones.
Here a different strategy, shown in Algorithm 1, is
proposed. The essential change is to treat the values
as being cyclically ordered, recording the value selected
for the previous row. Then possible values for this row
are considered by starting from the value following the
previous one selected. For this modification, vertical
growth remains unchanged.
Algorithm 1. Modified Horizontal Growth

the extended row (r; v) covers

Algorithm 1 incurs additional time to track the previous value selected, but this small addition is dominated by the computation of coverage, and hence makes
no change in the complexity of the method.

Addressing don’t care Positions

In horizontal growth, when the maximum number
of interactions that the extended row (r; v) can cover is
0, the value at this position is a don’t care. The don’t
care positions can be addressed using the method of
Subsection 3.1.
In vertical growth, new rows that are created to
cover the t-way combinations in π not covered by horizontal growth can leave positions not needed to cover
interactions in π as don’t care. The selection of these
values can influence the extension for the remaining parameters. To exploit these don’t care positions, one
strategy focuses on coverage, and the other on balance.
The balance strategy attempts to make values of
all parameters distributed evenly: as each don’t care
arises, it is filled with a value for this parameter that
currently appears the least often; ties are handled by
taking the next in the cyclic order of values after the
previous selection.
The coverage strategy is greedy. Don’t care positions produced in vertical growth are left unassigned
until the next horizontal growth. Then a value is chosen
so that the row covers the most uncovered interactions,
using the method described in Subsection 3.1.
Focusing on coverage is generally slightly superior in
reducing the size of test suites. However, the balance
strategy reduces the time to generate the test suite.
Because of our interest in fault detection, and the fact
that existing IPO variants use a coverage strategy, we
adopt the balance strategy here. The pseudo-code for
the balance strategy is shown in Algorithm 4.
Vertical growth treating don’t care positions using a
coverage strategy examines all t-way interactions, while

Algorithm 4. Addressing don’t care Positions
1. Number the values of Pi as v1 , v2 , . . . , v|Pi |
2. f req[Pi , j] is the frequency of value vj of Pi

5.
Find min that f req[Pi , min] is minimum

6.

7. end if

our balance strategy only examines frequencies. Savings are only incurred with the balance strategy when
don’t care positions arise during vertical growth. In
both cases, the worst-case complexity is dominated by
the cost of horizontal growth, so in principle the two
methods have the same asymptotic complexity. However, in practice, every don’t care position results in a
saving in computation time for the balance strategy.

Reducing the Expected Time to Fault
Detection

In [30], a measurement of the goodness of a test suite
at detecting a fault is defined. Suppose that every test
takes the same time to run. Further suppose that faults
are randomly distributed among the t-way interactions,
and that there is no a priori information about their location. For a system with s faults, the expected time to
fault detection is determined by the expected number
of tests to detect the presence of a fault. Φs denotes
the expected number of tests to detect the first fault in
a system with s faults.
PN ui 
Φs =

i=1 s

Λ

.

Here ui is the number of uncovered interactions before executing the i-th row, N is the number of rows
of the test suite, and Λ is the total number of t-way
interactions.
This measure applies to any test suite when faults
arise randomly, and is not intended to examine particular patterns of faults in specific systems. As such, it can
serve as a means to evaluate test suites for use in an
as-yet-unknown application.
Minimizing the expected time to fault detection
means constructing a test suite to minimize Φs given
s. Rather than constructing a test suite to minimize
Φs directly, we can reorder the rows of a test suite to
reduce Φs .
Because all faults of interest are caused by parameter interactions, the more uncovered interactions con-

962

tained in the test, the more likely a fault is to be revealed. Hence placing the tests that cover the greatest
number of the uncovered interactions early can increase
the probability of detecting a fault. To see this, we
rewrite the formula as follows:

PN ui 
N

Then the problem becomes minimizing the average
(ui )
value of Λs , the likelihood that all faults remain unde(s)
tected after running i tests. The method for reordering
the test suite is Algorithm 5. There may be a tie for
row rj where Tc [rj ] is the largest — if there is, the tie
would be broken randomly.

Experiments

We employ the tool ACTS-2.8 (Advanced Combinatorial Testing System)[43] , including implementations
of IPOG, IPOG-F and IPOG-F2, etc. We compare the
tool ACTS-2.8 with our variants of IPOG, IPOG-F and
IPOG-F2 in which the handling of don’t care positions
attempts to balance frequencies of values; our versions
are coded in C++. All of the experimental results reported here are performed on a laptop with CoreTM 2
Duo Intelr processor clocked at 2.60 GHz and 4 GB
memory.
5.1

Test Suite Size and Execution Time

First we examine the relative performance for different numbers of values for the parameters. The notation dt indicates that there are t parameters, each with

d values. To start, we vary the number of values. Table 1 shows execution time and test suite sizes when
the strength is 4, and there are five parameters whose
number of values is 5, 10, 15, or 20. As expected, the
execution time for our methods is substantially smaller
(see Fig.2). What is more surprising is that our methods consistently produce test suites no larger than the
original methods, and sometimes produce much smaller
ones.
Now we vary the number of parameters. Table 2
shows results when the strength is 4, the number of parameters is 10, 15, 20, or 25, and the number of values
is 5. Again the execution time for our methods shows
improvements (see Fig.3). However, as the number of
parameters increases, the deferral in filling don’t care
positions by the original methods generally produces
smaller test suite sizes.
Now we vary the strength. Table 3 presents results for 106 when the strength is 2, 3, 4, or 5. Once
again, the execution time for our methods is substantially lower (see Fig.4). Our methods do not fare as
well with respect to test suite size, but appear to be
very effective when the strength is larger.
Our methods appear to improve execution time consistently as expected. Nevertheless, they also improve
on test suite sizes in some cases, especially when the
strength is large or the number of values is large. Real
systems rarely have the same number of values for each
parameter, so we also consider situations in which different parameters can have different numbers of values.
Table 4 presents results with strength 4 for five
different sets of numbers of values for 10 parameters.
Execution time improvements again arise for our algorithms. Moreover, a pattern for test suite sizes is clear:
our methods improve when there is more variation in
numbers of values.
Next we examine the relative performance using
the Traffic Collision Avoidance System (TCAS), which
has been utilized in several other studies of software
testing[27,44-46] . TCAS has 12 parameters: seven parameters have two values, two parameters have three
values, one parameter has four values, and two parameters have 10 values. Table 5 gives the results. (In [46],
similar results for the original IPOG versions are given
for the TCAS system.) While our improvements in execution time are evident, no obvious pattern indicates
which method produces the smallest test suite.
Our methods have simplified the manner in which
don’t care positions are treated in order to balance the
frequencies of values. Our experimental results all con-

firm that this can dramatically reduce the execution
time. One might have expected a substantial degradation in the test suite sizes produced. However, our
results indicate not only that the balancing strategy
is competitive, but also that it can improve test suite
sizes.
Fast methods such as IPO do not generally produce the smallest test suites possible. To illustrate
this, we apply a post-optimization method from [4748] to some of the TCAS results. For strength 4, we
treat the solutions for IPOG-F2; within 10 minutes of
computation, post-optimization reduces the solution by
our method from 1 639 to 1 201 rows, and the solution
by the original method from 1 653 to 1 205 rows. For
strength 5, we treat the solutions for IPOG-F; within
one hour of computation, post-optimization reduces the
solution by our method from 4 068 to 3 600 rows, and
the solution by the original method from 4 245 also
to 3 600 rows. For strength 6, we treat the solutions

IPOG-F2(ACTS)

for IPOG; within 10 hours, post-optimization reduces
the solution by our method from 11 774 to 9 794 rows,
and the solution by the original method from 11 021 to
9 798 rows. By contrast, in a comparison of six different one-parameter-at-a-time methods[46] , the best result has 10 851 rows. While the test suites from oneparameter-at-a-time methods are therefore definitely
not the smallest, post-optimization is much more timeconsuming and it requires a test suite as input. As the
number of parameters increases, the speed with which
an initial test suite can be constructed is crucial.
5.2

Expected Time to Fault Detection

Accelerating the IPO methods, even with a possible loss of accuracy in test suite size, can be worthwhile. However, a second concern is with potential performance in revealing faults. We examine the TCAS
system, using our and the original versions of the three
IPO variants. We examine the time to find the first

965

fault when 1, 2, or 3 faults are present and when the
strength is between 2 and 6. In our model, the time to
execute each test is the same, so the expected time is
directly proportional to the expected number of tests or
rows needed. We consider test suites before and after
our reordering.
Table 6 gives the results. To assess the efficacy of
our modifications, we report two lines for each method
and each strength; the first reports results for our methods, and the second for the original methods. Φ1 , Φ2
and Φ3 denote the expected number of tests to detect
the first fault when there are one, two or three faults
that are randomly chosen.
These results indicate that reordering is effective in
reducing the time to fault detection, both for our met-

hods and for the original ones. Fig.5 shows Φ2 for each
strength before and after the reordering for our methods, showing a substantial reduction from reordering.
Fig.6 instead shows the expected number of tests when
zero, one, two, or three faults are present. It appears
that the reordering method is the most effective when
the number of faults is small. This should be expected,
because the presence of many faults ensures that one
will be found early no matter what ordering is used.
Our methods, despite often producing larger test
suites, fare well with respect to expected time to fault
detection. Comparing the performance of ours and the
original IPOG when t = 6, for example, although our
test suite is larger, it would yield smaller expected time
to detect faults once reordered. Evidently the size of the

test suite, while relevant, is not the only factor affecting the expected time. Our results suggest that faster
IPO implementations remain competitive, and hence
that the objective of balancing frequencies of values is
a reasonable one to pursue.

Conclusions

We identified three main goals in generating a test
suite: time to generate the test suite, time to execute
the test suite (test suite size), and the rate of fault
detection. Our methods focus on reducing the time
for generation, without severe negative impact on test
suite size and fault detection. We accelerated variants
of the IPO method by simplifying the manner in which
don’t care positions are filled. This results in a consistent improvement in the execution time to construct a
test suite, but sacrifices to some extent the algorithm’s
ability to exploit such positions in repeated horizontal
growth phases. This is reflected in our experimental results. While in numerous cases, our modifications find
smaller test suites, in the others they do not. This
occurs particularly when the number of parameters is
large.

Any method to fill don’t care positions immediately
would be expected to accelerate the methods; however
we devised a simple method that strives to balance the
frequency of values for each parameter. We argued that
such an objective can result in more effective horizontal growth, and that it can permit us to retain effective
rates of fault detection. Both of these motivations are
borne out by the experimental data.
One-test-at-a-time generation methods explicitly
aim for good rates of fault detection by covering interactions early in the test suite, while one-parameterat-a-time methods like IPO do not. Nevertheless, we
showed that a reordering strategy can be applied to
make dramatic improvement on the rate of fault detection.
If test suite size is a primary objective, using our methods together with randomized postoptimization[47-48] appears to be worthwhile. If expected time to fault detection is paramount, extending
reordering to discover and replace don’t care positions
appears to be viable. Both merit further study. We
suggest that both can benefit from balancing frequencies of values, a fast and simple way to generate useful
test suites.

Abstract—The largest strength of contention-based MAC protocols is simultaneously the largest weakness of their scheduled counterparts: the ability to adapt to changes in network
conditions. For scheduling to be competitive in mobile wireless
networks, continuous adaptation must be addressed. We propose
ATLAS, an Adaptive Topology- and Load-Aware Scheduling
protocol to address this problem. In ATLAS, each node employs a
random schedule achieving its persistence, the fraction of time a
node is permitted to transmit, that is computed in a topology
and load dependent manner. A distributed auction (REACT)
piggybacks offers and claims onto existing network traffic to
compute a lexicographic max-min channel allocation. A node’s
persistence p is related to its allocation. Its schedule achieving p
is updated where and when needed, without waiting for a frame
boundary. We study how ATLAS adapts to controlled changes
in topology and load. Our results show that ATLAS adapts to
most network changes in less than 0.1s, with about 20% relative
error, scaling with network size. We further study ATLAS in
more dynamic networks showing that it keeps up with changes
in topology and load sufficient for TCP to sustain multi-hop flows,
a struggle in IEEE 802.11 networks. The stable performance of
ATLAS supports the design of higher-layer services that inform,
and are informed by, the underlying communication network.

I. I NTRODUCTION
Despite the well known shortcomings of IEEE 802.11
and other contention-based MAC protocols for mobile wireless networks—such as probabilistic delay guarantees, severe
short-term unfairness, and poor performance at high load—
they remain the access method of choice. The primary reason
is their ease in adapting to changes in network conditions,
specifically to changes in topology and in load. The lack
of timely adaptation is the most serious limitation facing
scheduled MAC protocols. For scheduling to be competitive,
continuous adaptation is required.
Topology-dependent approaches to adaptation in scheduling
alternate a contention phase with a scheduled phase. In the
contention phase, nodes exchange topology information used
to compute a conflict-free schedule that is followed in the
subsequent scheduled phase (see, as examples, [5], [30]).
However, changes in topology and load do not always align
with the phases of the algorithm resulting in a schedule that
often lags behind the network state.
In contrast, the idea behind topology-transparent scheduling
is to design schedules independent of the detailed network
topology [3], [15]. Specifically, the schedules do not depend
on the identity of a node’s neighbours, but rather on how many

of them are transmitting. Even if a node’s neighbours change,
its schedule does not; if the number of neighbours does not exceed the designed bound then the schedule guarantees success.
Though such schedules are robust to network conditions that
deviate from the design parameters [27], because the schedules
do not adapt, the technique remains a theoretical curiosity.
In contention-based schemes, such as IEEE 802.11, a node
computes implicitly when to access the channel, basing its decisions on perceived channel contention. We instead compute
a node’s persistence—the fraction of time it is permitted to
transmit—explicitly in a way that tracks the current topology
and load. To achieve this, we propose ATLAS, an Adaptive
Topology- and Load-Aware Scheduling protocol. Channel
allocation is a resource allocation problem where the demands
correspond to transmitters, and the resources to receivers.
ATLAS implements the REsource AlloCaTion computed by
REACT, a distributed auction that runs continuously. REACT
piggybacks offers and claims onto existing network traffic to
compute the lexicographic max-min allocation to transmitters
which we call the TLA allocation, emphasizing that it is
both topology- and load-aware. Each node’s random schedule,
achieving a persistence informed by its allocation, is updated
whenever a change in topology or load results in a change
in allocation. While the slots of the schedule are grouped
into frames, this is done only to reduce the variance in delay
[6]; there is no need to wait for a frame boundary to update
the schedule. Even though the random schedules may not be
conflict-free, ATLAS is not contention-based; it does not select
persistences or make scheduling decisions based on perceived
channel contention—its decisions are based solely on topology
and load. We study how ATLAS adapts to controlled changes
in topology and load, measuring convergence time, relative
error, and scalability. We also assess the ability of ATLAS to
adapt in more dynamic network conditions.
To the best of our knowledge, ATLAS is the first scheduled
MAC protocol able to adapt to changes in topology and
load that is competitive with contention-based protocols in
throughput and delay while realizing superior delay variance.
It achieves this through the continuous computation of the
TLA allocation, and updating the schedule on-the-fly. These
updates occur only where and when needed. By not requiring
phases of execution and by computing persistences rather
than conflict-free schedules, ATLAS eliminates the complexity
of, and lag inherent in, topology-dependent approaches. By
not being dependent on the identity of neighbours, ATLAS
shares the best of topology-transparent schemes (and also their

potential for collisions) yet overcomes its weakness by being
adaptive. By not forcing updates to be frame synchronized,
ATLAS shares the critical features of continuous adaptation
with contention-based protocols. As a result, ATLAS achieves
predictable throughput and delay characteristics. Such characteristics and information about localized capacity at the MAC
layer may be used to inform higher layers, while end-toend characteristics at higher layers may be used to inform
ATLAS. This may support the development of an agile, higher
performing protocol stack.
The primary contributions of this paper are twofold: (1) The
REACT algorithm, an asynchronous, adaptive, and distributed
auction that solves a general resource allocation problem to
produce the TLA allocation. (2) ATLAS, a MAC protocol
that uses REACT to solve the specific problem of channel
allocation in a wireless network where each node produces
a random schedule with the number of transmission slots
determined by its allocation.
The sequel is organized as follows: Section II defines a
general resource allocation problem and presents the REACT
algorithm, proving its correctness. Section III expresses channel allocation as a resource allocation problem and defines
ATLAS. Related work is described in Section IV. After
describing the simulation set-up in Section V, Section VI
studies how ATLAS adapts to controlled changes in topology
and load, and to dynamic network conditions. In Section VII,
we discuss open issues and potential applications of REACT,
including the design of higher-layer services that inform, and
are informed by, the underlying communication channel.
II. D ISTRIBUTED R ESOURCE A LLOCATION — REACT
We consider a general resource allocation problem. Let R
be a set of N resources with capacity c = (c1 , . . . , cN ). Let D
be a set of M demands with magnitudes w = (w1 , . . . , wM ).
Resource j ∈ R is required by demands Dj ⊆ D. Demand
i ∈ D consumes capacity at all resources in Ri ⊆ R
simultaneously. The resource allocation s = (s1 , . . . , sM ),
si ≥ 0 defines the capacity P
reserved for the demands. Resource
allocation s is feasible if i∈Dj si ≤ cj for all j ∈ R and
si ≤ wi for all i ∈ D. Demand
P i is satisfied if si ≥ wi .
Resource j is saturated if
i∈Dj si ≥ cj . Throughout,
capacity refers to the magnitude of a resource.
Definition 1: [22] A feasible allocation s is lexicographically max-min if, for every demand i ∈ D, either i is satisfied,
or there exists a saturated resource j with i ∈ Dj where
si = max(sk : k ∈ Dj ).
We now describe REACT, a distributed auction that computes the lexicographic max-min allocation. In it, resources
are represented by auctioneers and demands by bidders. Each
auctioneer maintains an offer—the maximum capacity consumed by any adjacent bidder—and each bidder maintains a
claim—the capacity the bidder intends to consume at adjacent
auctions. The final claim of bidder i defines allocation si .
Auctioneer j satisfies Def. 1 locally by increasing its offer in
an attempt to become saturated while maintaining a feasible
allocation. Bidder i satisfies Def. 1 locally for demand i by
increasing its claim until it is satisfied or has a maximal claim

on the lexicographic max-min allocation. We give precise

events. Collectively, auctioneers and bidders know the inputs
to the allocation problem and bidder claims converge on
the lexicographic max-min allocation; the claim of bidder i
converges on si .
The correctness of Alg. 1 and Alg. 2 is established in
two steps: Lemma 1 establishes forward progress on the
number of auctioneers to have converged on their final offer.
Theorem 1 employs Lemma 1 to show eventual convergence
to the lexicographic max-min allocation. Let claimi denote the
claim of bidder i and offerj the offer of auctioneer j. Assume
that the resource allocation remains constant for the period of
analysis, that bidder i knows Ri and wi , and that auctioneer
j knows Dj and cj . Further assume communication between
adjacent auctioneers and bidders is not delayed indefinitely. A
claim or offer is stable if it has converged on its final value.
Denote by Astable the set of auctioneers whose offers are stable
and remain the smallest among all offers.
Lemma 1: Suppose Astable contains k auctioneers, 0 ≤ k <
N . Then, within finite time, at least one auctioneer converges

on the next smallest offer omin . Offers equal to omin are stable
and remain smaller than all other offers not in Astable .
Proof: Wait sufficient time for every bidder i to send a
new claim to auctioneers in Ri and for every auctioneer j to
send a new offer to bidders in Dj . Let omin be the smallest
offer of an auctioneer not in Astable . Assume to the contrary that
offerx for some x ∈
/ Astable is the first to become smaller than
omin . By Eq. 2 and 4, a decrease to offerx can only occur after a
bidder y at auction x with claimy < offerx increases its claim.
By Eq. 1, claimy can increase only after its limiting constraint
starts out smaller than offerx and increases. Constraints in the
system smaller than offerx are maximum claims, offers from
Astable , and offers equal to omin . Maximum claims and offers
from Astable do not change, leaving some x0 with offerx0 = omin
as the only potential limiting constraint for claimy . By Eq. 2
and 4, offerx0 can increase only after one of its bidders y 0
reduces its claim to be smaller than offerx0 . By Eq. 1, claimy0
can get smaller only after one of its auctioneers, say x00 ,
reduces its offer to be offerx00 < omin = offerx0 contradicting
the assumption that offerx is the first to become smaller than
omin . Therefore, offers equal to omin remain smaller than offers
not from Astable .
By Eq. 2 and 4, any j offering omin can change only after
a bidder i at auction j with claimi ≤ omin changes. By Eq. 1,
claimi only changes if its limiting constraint changes. Potential
limiting constraints include wi , offers from Astable , and offers
equal to omin . These constraints are stable; therefore, offers
equal to omin are stable.
Theorem 1: Bidders and auctioneers of Alg. 1 and Alg. 2
compute the lexicographic max-min allocation.
Proof: We apply Lemma 1 to show by induction that
every auctioneer eventually computes a stable offer.
Base Case: Consider an allocation problem with arbitrary
wi , cj , Ri , and Dj for 1 ≤ i ≤ M , 1 ≤ j ≤ N . Let |Astable | =
0. By Lemma 1, at least one auctioneer eventually converges
on a smallest offer omin . Offers equal to omin are stable and
remain smallest among all offers. Add auctioneers offering
omin to Astable ; |Astable | ≥ 1.
Inductive Step: Let |Astable | = k, 1 ≤ k < N . Then, by
Lemma 1 a non-empty set of auctioneers A+ with A+ ∩
Astable = ∅ eventually converge on the next smallest offer.
Offers from A+ remain smaller than offers not from A+ or
Astable and are stable. Add A+ to Astable ; |Astable | ≥ k + 1.
By induction, all auctioneers are eventually added to Astable .
Wait for auctioneers to send their offers to adjacent bidders.
Bidder claims are now stable. By Eq. 1, bidder i is either
satisfied with its claim (claimi = wi ) or its claim is maximal at
an auction in Ri . By Definition 1, the claims are lexicographic
max-min.

transmitter i and transmitter i is active. Dj contains the active
transmitters for which receiver j is within transmission range.
Receiver j is adjacent to transmitter i if j ∈ Ri and i ∈ Dj .
The sets Dj and Ri capture the network topology for active
transmitters. For load, wi is set to the percentage of slots
required to support the demand at transmitter i. Transmitters
with no demand (i.e., wi = 0) receive an allocation of zero
slots: they are not active. Receiver capacities are set to one,
targeting 100% channel allocation. The lexicographic max-min
solution s = (s1 , . . . , sM ) for a given topology and traffic load
is the TLA allocation.
To apply REACT to channel allocation, we integrate it into
ATLAS, a simple random scheduled MAC protocol. Although
REACT could instead augment contention-based schemes, we
choose to work within a scheduled environment, a traditionally
difficult setting for adaptation. In ATLAS, each node runs a
REACT bidder (Alg. 1) and a REACT auctioneer (Alg. 2)
continuously. Auctioneers and bidders discover each other as
they hear from one another and rely on the host node to detect
lost adjacencies. The network topology is implicit in the sets
Ri and Dj . Each node updates its bidder’s demand magnitude
to accurately reflect its traffic load. Offers and claims are encoded using eight bits each and are embedded within the MAC
header of all transmissions to be piggybacked on existing
network traffic. The encoding supports a total of 256 values for
offers, claims, and persistences uniformly distributed between
0 and 1; the error in the representation does not exceed 0.004.
Adding fields for an offer and claim to data packets and
acknowledgements results in a communication overhead of
four bytes per packet. For the slot size and data rate simulated
in Section VI, the overhead is 0.36%. A node’s offer and claim
are eventually received by all single-hop neighbours reaching
the bidders and auctioneers that need to know the offer and
claim. In time, the bidder claims in REACT converge on the
TLA allocation s.
Packets are acknowledged within the slot they are transmitted and slots are sized accordingly. Unacknowledged MAC
packets are retransmitted up to ten times before they are
dropped by the sender. Fig. 1 shows that collisions are possible
in ATLAS, and that successful transmissions are acknowledged in the same slot. The transmissions collide in slot x;
they are repeated (successfully) in slots x + 2 and x + 3. Fig. 1
also shows the frame structure.
The TLA allocation can be interpreted directly as a set of

persistences in a p-persistent MAC [28]. However, we achieve
lower variation in delay by introducing the notion of a frame
[6]. Specifically, ATLAS divides time into slots which are
organized into frames of v slots. Node i operates at persistence
pi = si . At the start of every frame and upon any change to
pi , node i computes ki = bpi vc + 1 with probability πi and
ki = bpi vc with probability 1 − πi where πi = pi v − bpi vc.
Node i constructs a transmission schedule of ki slots selected
uniformly at random. Over many frames, E[ki ]/v equals pi
where E[ki ] is the expectation for ki .
Fig. 2 shows the TLA allocation in a small example network
before and after a change in topology. Node 7 starts out
disconnected from the other nodes and moves within range
of node 3. In REACT, node 3 starts out offering 0.25 which is
claimed by the bidders of nodes 1, 2, 3, and 4. With the claims
of node 3 and 4 limited by the offer of node 3 and the claim
of node 6 limited by its demand, the auctioneer at node 4 is
free to offer 0.45, which is claimed by node 5. Upon detecting
node 7 as a neighbour, the auctioneer at node 3 decreases its
offer to 0.20. The bidders at nodes 1, 2, 3, 4, and 7 respond
by reducing their claims accordingly. The smaller claims of
the bidders at nodes 3 and 4 allow the auctioneer at node 4
to increase its offer to 0.55. The bidder at node 5 responds by
increasing its claim to 0.55. It can be verified that, before and
after the topology change, the claims of the bidders (i.e., the
values of si and s∗i ) are lexicographically max-min; that is,
every claim is satisfied or is maximal at an adjacent auction.
Consider the topology with node 3 and node 7 connected. The
bidder at node 6 is satisfied. The bidders at nodes 1, 2, 3, 4,
and 7 are maximal at the auction of node 3. The bidder at
node 5 is maximal at the auction of node 4.
There are many implementation choices to be made in applying REACT to channel allocation. We identify three binary
choices—lazy or eager persistences, physical layer or MAC
layer receivers, and weighted or non-weighted bidders—and
three configurable parameters—pmin , pdefault , and tlostNbr . The
choices are described here; they are evaluated in Section VI.

5

A. Lazy or Eager Persistences
A lazy approach sets persistence pi equal to the claim of
bidder i. Once converged, pi matches the TLA allocation
interpreted as a persistence. There is a potential disadvantage
with being lazy. For many applications, nodes cannot predict
future demand for the channel; they can only estimate demand
based on past events, i.e., packet arrival rate or queue depth.
As a consequence, wi lags the true magnitude of the demand
at node i. If wi is the limiting constraint for the claim
of bidder i, pi can be sluggish in response to increases
in demand. Alternatively, an eager approach sets persistence
pi = min (offers[j] : j ∈ Ri ), breaking the direct dependence
on wi . Under stable conditions, a node’s channel occupancy,
the fraction of time it spends transmitting, matches its TLA
allocation; its occupancy is limited by the availability of
packets to transmit which is no larger than wi , even when
pi > wi . By allowing pi > wi , the persistence is made more
responsive to sudden increases in demand.

overwhelmed by neighbouring transmitters, a non-zero persistence is needed to quiet the neighbours. To accomplish this, the
node enforces a minimum persistence pmin , creating dummy
packets if necessary, whenever the sum of claims from adjacent
bidders exceeds the auction capacity.
E. Overriding the TLA Allocation with pdefault
There are two conditions where a node constrains its persistence to be no larger than pdefault . The first is when it has
no neighbours. While the TLA allocation permits an isolated
node to consume 100% of the channel, it cannot discover new
neighbours if it does so. The second time a node employs
pdefault is for a short period after the discovery of a new
neighbour. It is possible for several nodes operating with large
persistences to join a neighbourhood at about the same time. If
the persistences are large enough, neighbour discovery can be
hindered. For both scenarios, limiting the persistence to pdefault
facilitates efficient neighbour discovery.

B. Physical Layer or MAC Layer Receivers

F. Adaptation to Topology Changes and tlostNbr

A central objective of the TLA allocation is to ensure
that no receiver is overrun. In a wireless network, receivers
can be defined in terms of physical layer or MAC layer
communication. At the physical layer, every node is a receiver. At the MAC layer, packets are filtered by destination
address; a node is only a receiver if one of its neighbours
has MAC packets destined to it. MAC layer receivers can
increase channel allocation by over-allocating at non-receiving
nodes. However, the overallocation can slow detection of
new receivers. Physical receivers prevent overallocation at any
receiver, making the allocation more responsive to changes in
traffic where nodes become receivers.

Changes in network topology are detected externally to
REACT. In ATLAS, neighbour discovery is performed independently by each node. If a node hears from a new neighbour,
then the node notifies its bidder of the new auction and
its auctioneer of the new bidder. Conversely, if a node has
not heard from a neighbour in more than tlostNbr seconds, it
presumes the node is no longer a neighbour and informs its
auctioneer and bidder accordingly.

C. Weighted or Non-Weighted Bidders
We have described a MAC protocol where transmitters are
represented by equally weighted bidders. For applications requiring multiple demands per transmitter, i.e., nodes servicing
more than one traffic flow, we propose the weighted TLA
allocation. The demands of weighted bidders are comprised
of one or more demand fragments; the number of fragments
accumulated into a demand is the demand’s weight. Let γi
be the weight for demand i. Demand fragments in demand i
have magnitude wi /γi . The weighted TLA allocation defines
the lexicographically max-min vector u = (u1 , . . . , uN ) where
ui is the allocation to each demand fragment in demand i
for a total allocation of ui γi to demand i. REACT can be
extended to compute the weighted TLA allocation. To do
this, each bidder must inform adjacent auctions of its weight.
Sixteen unique weights (with a four-bit representation) may
be sufficient for many applications.
D. Minimum Persistence pmin
A node can maintain a persistence of zero without impacting
the communication requirements of its bidder. For auctioneers,
a persistence of zero is problematic. If a receiver becomes

IV. R ELATED W ORK
This paper focuses on the TLA allocation, its continuous
distributed computation, and its application to setting transmitter persistences. In this section, we review a representative
set of scheduled MAC protocols, observing how each selects
a node’s persistence and adapts to topology and load.
Any finite schedule used in a cyclically repeated way can
be generalized as a (k, v)-schedule with k transmission slots
per frame of v slots, producing an effective persistence of
p = k/v. Examples include the random schedules of [6], [18]
where each node selects its k transmission slots randomly
from the set of v slots in the frame. Topology transparent schemes [3], [15], [27] also implement (k, v)-schedules.
These schedules rely on only two design parameters: N , the
number of nodes in the network, and Dmax , the maximum
supported neighbourhood size. These schedules guarantee each
node a collision-free transmission opportunity from each of
its neighbours at least once per frame, provided the node’s
neighbourhood size does not exceed Dmax . (k, v)-schedules do
not adapt to variations in neighbourhood size or traffic load.
The combinatorial requirements for variable-weight topology
transparent schedules (variable k) are explored in [19], but no
construction nor protocol using them is given.
A class of topology-dependent scheduled protocols compute
distance-2 vertex colourings of the network graph to achieve
TDMA schedules with spatial reuse. The colourings assign
one transmission slot to each node and do not adapt to

traffic load. One of the first distributed protocols to bound
the number of colours is proposed in [5]. Distributed-RAND
(DRAND) [25] is a distributed implementation of RAND (a
centralized algorithm for distance-2 colouring [23]). DRAND
runs a series of loosely synchronized rounds. A colour is
assigned in each round to one or more nodes in different
two-hop neighbourhoods. DRAND is employed by ZebraMAC (Z-MAC) [24] to compute schedules over which to run
CSMA/CA. Nodes are given priority access to their own slot,
but also allowed to contend for access in other unused slots, as
is done in [4]. Due to the complexity of DRAND, schedules
are only computed once during network initialization.
Other topology-dependent schemes support variable persistences. The periodic slot chains proposed in [14] are not
limited to the structure of a fixed length frame and can support
variable and arbitrarily precise persistences. A slot chain is
defined by its starting transmission slot and period between
its consecutive transmission slots. By combining multiple
slot chains with different periods, schedules are constructed
targeting any rational persistence in the range [0, 1]. The
computation of slot chains provided in [14] is centralized; a
distributed mechanism to adaptively compute the slot chains
remains an open problem. In [30], a five phase reservation
protocol (FPRP) computes conflict-free schedules where a
node can reserve one or more transmission slots in the frame
to achieve variable persistences. Reservation frames are run
periodically rather than on a demand basis and, therefore, may
not accommodate the current topology and traffic load.
In SEEDEX [26], nodes do not attempt to derive conflictfree schedules. They learn the identities of their two-hop
neighbours and adjust transmission probabilities (i.e., persistences) to improve the likelihood of collision-free transmissions. The transmission probabilities accommodate the number
and identity of neighbours, but not traffic load.
In our earlier work [20], a distributed algorithm for computing the TLA allocation is provided; however, the algorithm
assumes a fixed topology and does not adapt to changes in the
network. REACT solves these limitations by asynchronously
adapting to changes in both topology and traffic demand.

A. Scenario Details
Unless otherwise noted, all four configurations run with
pdefault = 0.05, tlostNbr = 0.5s, and pmin = 0.01. The selection
of pdefault and tlostNbr are justified by results in Figs. 5, 11a,
and 11b. The selection of pmin is based on [20]. Frames
contain v = 100 slots of length 800µs (1100 bytes per slot).
Simulations are run using the ns-2 simulator [21]. Each
wireless node is equipped with a single half-duplex transceiver
and omni-directional antenna whose physical properties match
those of the 914 MHz Lucent WaveLAN DSS radio. The data
rate for all simulations is 11 Mbps. The transmission and
carrier sense ranges are 250m.
Each simulation runs a network scenario composed of a
randomly generated topology and a randomly generated traffic
load. Unless specified otherwise, topologies contain 50 randomly placed nodes constrained to a 300 × 1500m2 area. With
the exception of the multi-hop TCP flows in Section VI-F,
each traffic load consists of single-hop constant rate traffic.
Four traffic loads are simulated: 20% and 80% of nodes loaded
with small demands (75 ± 50 pkts/s), 20% and 80% of nodes
loaded with large demands (500 ± 50 pkts/s). Nodes loaded
with traffic are selected at random and the demand magnitudes
are selected uniformly at random from the specified range.
The packet destination is selected dynamically from the set
of neighbouring nodes as the packet is passed down to the
MAC layer. For the Weighted Bidders configuration, each
demand is assigned a random integer weight between one
and five. Traffic is generated by constant bit rate generators
and transported over UDP; packets are 900 bytes in length,
leaving room in each slot for header bytes and a MAC layer
acknowledgement. Combined with the random placement of
nodes and the addition of mobility, these four traffic loads
enable simulation of a wide variety of network conditions.
B. Relative Error
A metric of interest is the average relative error for a
node’s persistence with respect to the TLA allocation. Error
is reported in two parts: relative excess and deficit persistence
error. Errors are measured per node over 80ms consecutive
intervals in time (equal to the length of one MAC frame).
We compute the average relative excess error and average
relative deficit error for a given sample set of persistence
measurements. The relative errors are ratios, requiring use of
the geometric rather than arithmetic mean. But, the errors are
often zero, preventing direct use of their mean. Instead, we
convert errors into accuracies eliminating zeros from the data
set for a more meaningful geometric average. The average
relative accuracies are converted back to relative errors.

V. S IMULATION S ET- UP
We now describe the simulations used to produce the experimental results presented in Section VI. Table I lists the four
ATLAS configurations simulated. The Nominal configuration
employs eager persistences, defines receivers in terms of MAC
layer communication, and operates with unweighted bidders.
The other three configurations differ from the Nominal case
by a single choice and are named accordingly.

VI. E VALUATION OF ATLAS
Results from [20] show the TLA allocation applied in a
static network to maintain expected delay and throughput
compared to IEEE 802.11, while reducing the variance for
both metrics. The TLA allocation nearly eliminates packets
dropped by the MAC layer. In this section, we build on these
results, focusing on the efficient distributed computation of the

simulations of 1000 network scenarios, 250 of each traffic
load. The scenarios are simulated eight times each, once per
default persistence: 0.001, 0.005, 0.01, 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, and
0.4. Small default persistences (pdefault ≤ 0.01) limit a node’s
ability to communicate during neighbour discovery, slowing
convergence. Large default persistences (pdefault ≥ 0.3) permit
nodes to transmit with large persistences before they discover
their neighbours. In networks with 40 large demands, the large
persistences can overwhelm the channel preventing neighbour
discovery and delaying convergence. ATLAS is robust to the
selection of pdefault with a suitable range of [0.05–0.2]. For the
remaining simulations, pdefault is 0.05.
B. Convergence after a Change in Demand

TLA allocation in the face of changes in topology and load.
The results presented here work to answer four questions:
1) Can ATLAS converge quickly on the TLA allocation?
2) Can ATLAS scale to larger networks?
3) Can ATLAS keep up with changes in a mobile network?
4) Can ATLAS adapt to multi-hop traffic flows?
The first question is addressed Sections VI-A, VI-B, and VI-C.
The second is addressed in Section VI-D. The third and
fourth questions are addressed in Sections VI-E and VI-F,
respectively. Continuing the focus on adaptation, Section VI-G
provides comparisons with several scheduled protocols.
A. Convergence after Network Initialization
Fig. 3 reports average convergence times for all four ATLAS configurations. Error bars denote the arithmetic standard
deviation from the mean for each sample set. Convergence is
measured from network initialization (time = 0) to the time
ATLAS converges on the TLA allocation. Times are collected
from simulations of 1000 network scenarios simulated four
times each, once per configuration. There are 250 scenarios
for each traffic load.
The Physical Receivers configuration converges fastest in
less than 0.4s on average for networks with 40 large demands
and faster for other traffic loads. The extra step of detecting
MAC receivers slows convergence. The Lazy Persistences
configuration is the slowest with an average convergence time
of 0.67s for networks with 40 large demands. The strict
limit on persistences enforced by this configuration slows
convergence compared to the others.
Fig. 4a shows average excess and deficit relative persistence
errors for all four configurations. The averages are computed
for nodes with a non-zero TLA allocation and only during convergence. Nodes are observed to operate within approximately
20% of their TLA allocation regardless of configuration.
Deficit errors are larger than excess errors reflecting a tendency
to converge from below, rather than above, the TLA allocation.
In Fig. 4b, each data point reflects the convergence time (xcoordinate) and total relative persistence error (y-coordinate)
for one simulation of the nominal configuration. The data
shows relative persistence error to be fairly consistent from
network to network with a maximum observed error of 27%.
Fig. 5 reports convergence time for the Nominal configuration while varying pdefault . Convergence is measured for

Fig. 6 reports convergence times and relative persistence
errors for the Nominal configuration following a change to a
single demand magnitude. Four types of demand are simulated: a new small demand, a new large demand, a removed
small demand, and a removed large demand. New demands
start with magnitude zero and change to 75 ± 50 pkts/s for
small demands and to 500 ± 50 pkts/s for large demands.
Removed small demands and removed large demands start
at 75 ± 50 pkts/s and at 500 ± 50 pkts/s, respectively; both
change to zero. The four demand change types are simulated
under the four traffic loads. REACT is allowed to converge
on the initial TLA allocation prior to the demand change.
Convergence times and error measurements are taken from
simulations of 4000 network scenarios, 250 for each of the 16
demand change and traffic load combinations.
Fig. 6a reports convergence times measured from the time
of the change to the time of convergence on the new TLA
allocation. The largest convergence times of approximately
0.175s are found in networks loaded with 40 demands. The
average convergence time for the other scenarios is 0.125s
or smaller. Fig. 6b shows relative persistence errors measured
during convergence at nodes whose TLA allocation are affected by the demand change. Persistences are observed to be
within 10% of the TLA allocation.
C. Convergence after a Change in Topology
Fig. 7 reports convergence time and relative persistence
error following two types of topology change: the creation
of a link and the removal of a link between a pair of nodes.
Simulations are run on 2000 network scenarios, 250 for each
topology change type and traffic load combination. Networks
that lose a link are simulated once per neighbour timeout
tlostNbr of 0.5s, 2.0s and 5.0s.
Network topologies are generated as follows. A first node
is placed at a random location in the simulation area. For
topologies gaining a link, a second node is placed just outside
the transmission range of the first node with a trajectory
toward the first node. For topologies losing a link, the second
node is placed just inside the transmission range of the first
node with a trajectory away from the first node. The remaining
48 nodes are placed at random locations in the simulation area.
The distance travelled by the second node is constrained to
avoid unintentional topology changes.

(b) Convergence time vs. error for the Nominal configuration.

Relative persistence error for ATLAS.

Convergence times when run with varying default persistences.

The expected convergence time following the addition of a
new link is 0.025s. For tlostNbr =0.5s, convergence is reached in
less than 0.13s on average. For tlostNbr =2.0s and tlostNbr =5.0s,
the large convergence times are dominated by tlostNbr . Except
for the simulations of Fig. 11, all others configure ATLAS
with tlostNbr =0.5s. During convergence, nodes affected by the
topology change are observed to operate within 4% of their
TLA allocation on average. These numbers are striking. The
small convergence times stem from a counterintuitive feature
of the TLA allocation: the majority of topology changes do
not affect the TLA allocation. A new link only has an effect
if the link connects a bidder with an auction that lacks the
capacity to support the bidder’s claim. Even in heavily loaded
networks, many auctions have spare capacity to support a new
bidder. For these scenarios, convergence is instantaneous.
D. Scalability to Large Networks
We now turn to results demonstrating ATLAS’s scalability.
We simulate 10 network sizes with the x-dimension ranging
from 600m (2.4 hops) to 6000m (24 hops) in 600m increments;
the y-dimension is held constant at 300m. The number of
nodes is selected to keep the average neighbourhood density
constant across all network sizes. Fig. 8 reports convergence
times for 4000 network scenarios, 100 of each traffic load
and network size combination. The convergence of ATLAS
in large networks is striking. In networks spanning 24 hops,

convergence is reached in an average of 0.89s, a mere 40%
increase compared to networks spanning 4.8 hops.
The impressive convergence times, particularly those of
networks spanning 12 or more hops, suggest that convergence
happens locally, allowing distant neighbourhoods to converge
in parallel. This local behaviour is captured in Fig. 9 which
reports the average distance between a network change and a
node whose bidder changes its claim in response. Distances
are reported in hops. A node that changes its demand or
gains/loses a neighbour has distance zero. Neighbours of this
node have distance one, and so on. Range of impact is reported
for the six types of change evaluated in Sections VI-B and
VI-C. Each type of change is simulated in 1000 network
scenarios, 250 of each traffic load. The range of impact is
less than 1.75 hops on average.
E. Performance with Node Mobility
Section VI-C addresses the robustness of ATLAS to single topology changes. We now evaluate its performance in
networks with continuous mobility which may not have the
opportunity to converge on the TLA allocation.
Fig. 10a reports persistence error for node speeds ranging
from 0 m/s to 120 m/s with 200 scenarios simulated for each
node speed, 50 of each traffic load. Node movements are
generated using the steady-state mobility model generator of
[13] with a pause time of zero. Simulations are run for 20s.
As node speeds increase, so do deficit persistence errors. The
larger deficit errors are an artifact of lost neighbour detection
which is delayed by tlostNbr = 0.5s. As a result, nodes tend to
think their neighbourhoods are more crowded than they are, a
tendency that gets worse as node speeds increase. In terms of
REACT, auctioneers and bidders unnecessarily constrain their
offers and claims to accommodate lost neighbours. The deficit
persistences translate to degraded throughput. Fig. 10b reports
MAC throughput for the simulations of Fig. 10a. Even with
node speeds of 120 m/s where a node travels its transmission
range in 2.1s, throughput degrades modestly, decreasing by
less than 20% compared to static networks.
Fig. 11 shows that a large tlostNbr exacerbates deficit persistence error and further degrades throughput. Data is collected
from 200 scenarios, 50 of each traffic load. Each scenario is
simulated five times with neighbour timeouts ranging from

0.1s to 15.0s. Node speeds are fixed at 30 m/s. Degraded
performance is observed for large timeouts, tlostNbr ≥ 0.5s,
but also for small timeouts, tlostNbr = 0.1s. In networks
loaded with 10 large demands, tlostNbr = 0.1s causes nodes
to falsely identify lost neighbours that must be rediscovered.
The remaining simulations are run with tlostNbr = 0.5s.
Fig. 12 reports packet delay for ATLAS and IEEE 802.11
for the 200 network scenarios of Fig. 10 with node speeds
equal to 30 m/s. IEEE 802.11 is configured with a maximum
packet retry count of seven for RTS, CTS, and ACKs and four
for data packets [11], a mini-slot length of 20µs, and minimum
and maximum contention window sizes of 32 and 1024 slots,
respectively. Each point in the scatter plot reports the average
packet delay (x-coordinate) and variation in packet delay (ycoordinate) for a single node. The largest reported average
delay is 0.047s for ATLAS and 0.058s for IEEE 802.11. The
largest reported variation in delay for ATLAS is 0.0016s2 ,
just 3.6% of the 0.0444s2 reported for IEEE 802.11. This
impressive reduction in delay variance is crucial to the support
of TCP, which we evaluate next.
F. Multi-hop TCP Flows

Fig. 9.

Average range of impact (in hops) for a demand or topology change.

To this point, we have used MAC layer traffic to simulate
a diverse set of network scenarios. We now evaluate the
performance of ATLAS using multi-hop TCP flows. To accommodate the dynamic nature of these flows, each node estimates
its own demand by monitoring queue behaviour. Demand is
estimated as the sum of two parts: wenqueue and wlevel . wenqueue

is the percentage of channel required to keep up with the current enqueue packet rate, wenqueue = (packet enqueue rate) ×
(slot length). wlevel is the percentage of channel required to
transmit all packets in the queue within 0.2s (i.e., 25 slots),
wlevel = [(# packets in queue)/0.02s] × (slot length).
To avoid cross-layer interactions between the MAC and
routing protocols, Dijkstra’s shortest path algorithm [28] using
accurate knowledge of the global topology computes the next
hop address for all packet transmissions. FTP agents emulate
transfer of infinite size files to create flows with throughput
limited only by the performance of the network. Transfers start
at time zero and run for 20s. Nodes are statically placed at
random locations in a 300 × 1500m2 simulation area. The
source and destination nodes for each file transfer are selected

at random. Each FTP transfer is transported over TCP Reno
configured for selective acknowledgements, the extensions
of RFC 1323 [1], and 900 byte TCP segments. The return
ACKs are not combined with each other or with other data
packets. Consequently, the transmission of a single 40-byte
TCP ACK consumes an entire transmission slot in ATLAS.
The maximum congestion window size is 32 packets. Network
scenarios are simulated for three traffic loads: networks with
2, 8, and 25 TCP flows. The number of replicates per traffic
load are chosen so that 3000 TCP flows are simulated for each.
Fifteen hundred scenarios are simulated with two TCP flows,
375 with eight TCP flows, and 120 with 25 TCP flows.
We simulate TCP traffic on five MAC protocols: the four
configurations of ATLAS and IEEE 802.11. The configurations of ATLAS use pdefault = 0.05, tlostNbr = 0.5s, and
pmin = 0.01. IEEE 802.11 parameters match those described
in Section VI-E. Each node dynamically sets its bidder weight
to one or the number of outgoing TCP flows it services,
whichever is larger.
The 15 sub-plots in Fig. 13 show the percentage of flows
(y-axis) achieving a minimum throughput (x-axis). The distinguishing characteristics of the three unweighted ATLAS
configurations are seen in the throughput curves for networks
with two flows. These networks are loaded lightly enough for
the auctions at non-receiver nodes to make a difference in the
allocation, improving throughput for 2- and 4-hop flows. These
networks also demonstrate how the longer initial packet delays
of the Lazy Persistences configuration increase round trip time

1-hop, 2-hop, and 3-hop flows, respectively. Plots in the fifth row report on 4- and 5-hop flows.

for 4- and 5-hop flows, preventing TCP from achieving its best
throughput.
The Weighted Bidders configuration performs well for
multi-hop flows in networks with eight and 25 flows by
allocating more to multi-hop flows at the expense of singlehop flows. Because one-hop flows tend to achieve higher
throughput, the configuration maintains a tighter variation in
flow throughputs as indicated by the steeper slope of the
Weighted Bidders curve in the top right plot of Fig. 13.
Regardless of configuration, ATLAS surpasses IEEE 802.11

in support of concurrent multi-hop flows. The interaction
between the IEEE 802.11 back-off algorithm and TCP’s congestion control is well known [9]. In testbed experiments, a
single TCP flow with no competition has difficulty reaching a
destination four hops away [16]. Our simulations corroborate
these findings, as approximately 50% of the 4- and 5-hop flows
report a throughput of zero. For networks with 25 demands,
nearly 75% of 2-hop flows are non-functional; 3-, 4-, and 5hop flows are almost completely shut out. The throughput of

12

ATLAS is achieved in spite of channel wasted transmitting 40
byte TCP ACKs in their own slots.

G. Comparison with other Scheduled MAC Protocols
Here, we compare the adaptation of ATLAS with several
other scheduled protocols including DRAND, Z-MAC, FPRP,
and SEEDEX. Although the first three compute conflict-free
schedules, an NP-hard problem [7], a comparison highlights
the agility of ATLAS.
1) Adaptation to Topology Changes: For the simulations of
Section VI-E, the number of neighbour changes (i.e., gained
or lost neighbours) per second experienced by a node is
correlated to the node speed. When the nodes move at 30 m/s,
each node is expected to gain, or lose, a neighbour 2.21 times
per second; within 6.3s, the number of neighbour changes is
expected to exceed the neighbourhood size.
Based on the run times reported in [25, Fig. 10], we
estimate DRAND to compute schedules for the networks in
Section VI-E in approximately 4.9s (adjusting for data rate
and a two-hop neighbourhood size of 27). In this time, the
topology changes caused by nodes moving at 30 m/s are
expected to invalidate the computed schedule. Z-MAC has
the same limitation and, although it compensates by running
CSMA/CA to resolve collisions, it does not benefit from its
TDMA schedule when nodes are mobile. In [25], the run
times reported for FPRP schedule generation are comparable
to DRAND. For SEEDEX, nodes discover their two-hop
neighbours using a fan-in/fan-out procedure described in [26].
However, a practical integration of the procedure into the MAC
protocol is not described or evaluated, preventing a comparison
of its agility with other MAC protocols. In contrast to the slow
schedule computation times of DRAND, Z-MAC, and FPRP,
ATLAS is shown to handle node speeds of up to 120 m/s with
only moderate degradation to MAC throughput.
2) Adaptation to Changes in Traffic Load: The persistences
achieved by DRAND and SEEDEX are dependent on topology
alone; neither adapts to traffic load. Although Z-MAC adapts
to load, it does so by deviating from its underlying schedule,
which does not adapt. FPRP can adapt to load by scheduling
a variable number of slots per node; this is done at the
expense of both longer frame lengths and longer run times for
schedule computation. In contrast, ATLAS adapts to traffic
load, responding quickly enough to establish and maintain
multi-hop TCP flows.
3) Continuous Adaptation: Common to the scheduled
schemes mentioned here is the use of a distinct phase for
schedule computation (or neighbour discovery for SEEDEX).
The schedules must be updated in order for the MAC to adapt.
Any fixed period between schedule updates must be selected a
priori; it cannot be adjusted for variations in network mobility.
If schedules are to be updated when needed, a mechanism is
required to trigger the schedule update. This coordination, by
itself, is a challenge in an ad hoc network. In contrast, ATLAS
does not employ a schedule computation (or a neighbour
discovery) phase and adapts continuously to changes in both
topology and traffic load.

VII. D ISCUSSION
In this section we discuss open issues and suggest potential
applications for REACT and ATLAS.
A. Improved Reliable Transport
TCP’s congestion control algorithm is known to suffer cross-layer interactions with binary exponential back-off
(BEB) employed by IEEE 802.11 [9]. BEB is short term
unfair, allowing a single node to capture the channel at the
expense of its neighbours [2], [10] causing high variation in
packet delay and making it difficult for TCP to estimate roundtrip delay. Many modifications have been proposed to improve
TCP performance over wireless networks [17]; common approaches are detection of packet loss (differentiating it from
congestion) and improved estimation of round trip time. An
alternative is to minimize packet loss and control variation
in packet delay at the MAC layer. ATLAS demonstrates a
remarkable control of variation in delay (Fig. 12) enabling
TCP to reliably support 3-, 4-, and 5-hop flows over heavily
loaded networks (Fig. 13). However, TCP throughput still
degrades considerably as the number of hops grows. Potential
areas for future work include the integration of ATLAS into
a cross-layer solution for reliable transport over wireless
networks and the use of REACT to inform TCP’s congestion
window size.
B. Selection of Configurable Parameters
ATLAS has three configurable parameters: pdefault , tlostNbr ,
and pmin . Based on our simulations, [0.01–0.2] is an acceptable
range for pdefault (Fig. 5) and [0.1s–2s] is an acceptable range
for tlostNbr (Figs. 11a, 11b). In [20], pmin =0.1s is found to
be acceptable for a protocol that enforces pmin at all nodes
and at all times. Because ATLAS employs pmin temporarily,
and only when needed, it is less sensitive to the selection of
pmin . Although results show ATLAS to be robust to parameter
selection, tuning may be required in other scenarios or in a
hardware implementation.
C. Dynamic Selection of Auction Capacity
ATLAS targets 100% channel allocation by setting auction
capacities in REACT to one. Although simulation results
show this to be an adequate choice, it is not clear whether
performance can be improved by under- or over-allocating the
channel. Indeed, optimal auction capacities (however optimal
is defined) are dependent on network topology and quality of
the communication channel. We leave a thorough analysis of
auction capacity selection to future work, pointing out here
that REACT adapts continuously, allowing auction capacities
to be adjusted dynamically, if necessary.
D. Potential Applications for REACT
The weighted TLA allocation opens doors for several potential uses. In the simulations of Section VI-F, a bidder’s
weight is set according to the number of flows it services.
It may be desirable to set weights according to queue levels,

13

demand magnitudes, neighbourhood sizes, node betweenness
[8], distance from a point of interest (i.e., an access point or a
common sink), position in a multicast/broadcast tree, or path
hop count. The key observation is that ATLAS maintains flexibility by allowing nodes to define bidder weights arbitrarily
to suit the needs of the network.
While computation of persistences is the primary motivation
for this work, REACT is not limited to this purpose. Consider
the Physical Receivers configuration with node demands set
to one. The resulting allocation is independent of actions
taken by the upper network layers and, therefore, can inform
decisions made by those layers. It can serve as a measure of
potential network congestion—small allocations are assigned
in dense neighbourhoods containing many potentially active
neighbours. The routing protocol can use the allocation to
discover alternate routes around congestion.
An intriguing application is the implementation of differentiated service at the MAC layer. IEEE 802.11e [12] enhances
the distributed coordination function by implementing four
access categories; an instance of the back-off algorithm is run
per access category, each with its own queue. The probability of transmission of each access category is manipulated
independently through selection of contention window size
and inter-frame space. This permits higher priority traffic to
capture the channel from lower priority traffic.
Similar results can be achieved by four instances of REACT,
each computing the allocation for a single access category.
Prioritization is achieved through dynamic coordination of the
four auction capacities at each node. A potential strategy sets
the capacity for each access category equal to one minus the
allocation to higher priority access categories. As a result,
higher priority auctions are permitted to starve lower priority
auctions of capacity, effectively distributing channel access to
high priority traffic. Alternatively, auction capacities can be
selected to ensure a minimum or maximum percentage of the
channel is offered to an access category.
A network can run multiple instances of REACT. For
example, an instance of the Physical Receivers configuration
with all demands set to one can be run concurrently with
four instances configured to support differentiated service.
Alternatively, multiple instances of REACT can be used to
allocate more than one set of resources concurrently.
E. Assumptions Made by ATLAS
Two key assumptions are made by ATLAS in its computation of the TLA allocation using REACT: (1) The offers and
claims received by a node are accurate. (2) The offers and
claims of a node are eventually received by all neighbouring
nodes. The first assumption is reasonable, provided received
packets are checked for errors by the link layer. The second assumption is almost certainly invalid; asymmetric communication, interference beyond the range of transmission, and signal
fading are common in wireless communication and can prevent
the delivery of offers and claims. Under realistic conditions,
REACT may not converge on the TLA allocation, risking overallocation of the channel. In practice, auctions can adjust their
capacities to mitigate the over-allocation. Every node knows

the persistences of its neighbours (from bidder claims) and
can compute the expectation for collisions on the channel.
Significant deviations above this expectation can trigger the
auction to lower its capacity. An evaluation in a testbed of real
radios is necessary to understand the sensitivity to anomalies
on the wireless channel and the effectiveness of adjusting
auction capacities to accommodate channel conditions.
The evaluation of ATLAS in Section VI assumes both slot
and frame synchronization; ATLAS does not require either.
The computation of the TLA allocation by REACT does not
rely on a frame structure and the expected performance of the
random schedules is not affected by loss of frame synchronization. Even without slot synchronization, REACT can compute
the TLA allocation; however, loss of slot synchronization
may reduce channel capacity by 50% (see Aloha vs. slotted
Aloha in [28]). ATLAS can accommodate the lower channel
capacity by reducing auction capacity. This technique may
allow ATLAS to be run on commodity IEEE 802.11 hardware
[29] that lacks native support for slot synchronization. This is
a subject of our current research.
F. Enhancing Existing MAC Protocols
We have used REACT to compute persistences to be employed within ATLAS, a slotted MAC protocol. Alternatively,
REACT can be run on top of the IEEE 802.11 MAC by
embedding claims and offers in the headers of existing control
and data messages. The TLA allocation can be used to inform
the selection of contention window sizes, eliminating the need
for (and negative side effects of) binary exponential back
off. We are currently working to integrate REACT into IEEE
802.11. Another alternative (and more ambitious) approach is
to implement TLA persistences in a topology-dependent MAC
that computes conflict-free schedules. Only a few topologydependent schemes allow a node to reserve more than one
slot in a frame (i.e., [14], [30]), and those do not define how
many slots a node should reserve. The TLA allocation can
establish a permissible number of slots to be reserved by each
node, given the current topology and traffic load.
VIII. C ONCLUSION
We have proposed REACT, a distributed auction that
converges continuously on the TLA allocation, adapting to
changes in both topology and traffic load. The utility of REACT is demonstrated through integration into ATLAS which
we simulate under a wide variety of network scenarios. The
results presented suggest that REACT can effectively inform
the selection of transmitter persistences, and that ATLAS can
provide robust, reliable, and scalable services. The application
of REACT is not restricted to the computation of transmitter
persistences. It has the potential to inform routing and admission control decisions, to enable differentiation of service at
the MAC layer, and even to allocate other node resources.
In this context, the REACT algorithm provides a potential
solution to the immediate challenge of medium access control,
but also shows promise as a tool for use in network protocol
design in general.

SEQUENCE COVERING ARRAYS∗

JUNLING ZHOU¶
Abstract. Sequential processes can encounter faults as a result of improper ordering of subsets
of the events. In order to reveal faults caused by the relative ordering of t or fewer of v events, for
some fixed t, a test suite must provide tests so that every ordering of every set of t or fewer events
is exercised. Such a test suite is equivalent to a sequence covering array, a set of permutations on
v events for which every subsequence of t or fewer events arises in at least one of the permutations.
Equivalently it is a (diﬀerent) set of permutations, a completely t-scrambling set of permutations,
in which the images of every set of t chosen events include each of the t! possible “patterns.” In
event sequence testing, minimizing the number of permutations used is the principal objective. By
developing a connection with covering arrays, lower bounds on this minimum in terms of the minimum
number of rows in covering arrays are obtained. An existing bound on the largest v for which the
minimum can equal t! is improved. A conditional expectation algorithm is developed to generate
sequence covering arrays whose number of permutations never exceeds a specified logarithmic function
of v when t is fixed, and this method is shown to operate in polynomial time. A recursive product
construction is established when t = 3 to construct sequence covering arrays on vw events from ones
on v and w events. Finally computational results are given for t ∈ {3, 4, 5} to demonstrate the utility
of the conditional expectation algorithm and the product construction.

1. Introduction. A set of permutations {π1 , . . . , πN } of a v-element set X is
completely t-scrambling if for every ordered t-set (x1 , . . . , xt ) with xi ∈ X for 1 ≤ i ≤ t,
there is some ρ (1 ≤ ρ ≤ N ) for which πρ (xi ) < πρ (xj ) if and only if i < j. Spencer
[32] first explored the existence of completely t-scrambling sets of permutations in
generalizing a question of Dushnik [15] on linear extensions. Recently Kuhn et al.
[23, 24] examined an equivalent combinatorial object, the sequence covering array.
For parameters N , t, and v, such an array is a set of n permutations of v letters so
that every permutation of every t of the v letters appears—in the specified order—in
at least one of the n permutations. The motivation for finding sequence covering
arrays with small values of n arises in event sequence testing. Suppose that a process
involves a sequence of v tasks or events. The operator may, unfortunately, fail to
do the tasks in the correct sequence. When this happens, errors may occur. But
we anticipate that errors can be attributed to the (improper) ordering of a small

SEQUENCE COVERING ARRAYS

subset of tasks. When each permutation of a sequence covering array is used in
turn to specify a task order, every potential ordering of t or fewer tasks will be
tried and hence all errors found that result solely from the improper ordering of t
or fewer tasks. Applications are discussed further in [19, 23, 39, 40]; related event
sequence testing problems in which tasks can be repeated are discussed in [42, 43, 44].
While the application of these combinatorial structures is of much practical concern,
our interest is in bounds on the size of sequence covering arrays and their explicit
construction.
We first state the problem formally. Let Σ = {0, . . . , v − 1} be symbols that
represent the v tasks or events. A t-subsequence of Σ is a t-tuple (x1 , . . . , xt ) with
xi ∈ Σ for 1 ≤ i ≤ t, and xi ̸= xj when i ̸= j. A permutation π of Σ covers the
t-subsequence (x1 , . . . , xt ) if π −1 (xi ) < π −1 (xj ) whenever i < j. For example, with
v = 5 and t = 3, (4, 0, 3) is a 3-subsequence that is covered by the permutation 4 2
0 3 1. A sequence covering array of order v and strength t, or SeqCA(N ; t, v), is a set
Π = {π1 , . . . , πN }, where πi is a permutation of Σ, and every t-subsequence of Σ is
covered by at least one of the permutations {π1 , . . . , πN }. Often the permutations are
written as an N × v array.
We use an array representation for completely t-scrambling sets of permutations
as well. An N × v array is a completely t-scrambling set of permutations of strength t
on v symbols, or CSSP(N ; t, v), when the columns are indexed by Σ and the symbols
by Σ, and for every way c1 , . . . , ct to choose t distinct columns and every permutation
φ of {1, . . . , t}, there is a row ρ for which, for every 1 ≤ a < b ≤ t, the entry in cell
(ρ, cφ(a) ) is less than the entry in cell (ρ, cφ(b) ).
Lemma 1.1. A CSSP(N ; t, v) is equivalent to a SeqCA(N ; t, v).
Proof. If π1 , . . . , πN are the N permutations of a SeqCA(N ; t, v), form an N × v
array A in which cell (i, j) contains πi−1 (j). Then A is a CSSP(N ; t, v).
In the opposite direction, if A is a CSSP(N ; t, v), define permutation πi by setting
πi (aij ) = j for 1 ≤ i ≤ N and 0 ≤ j < v. Then π1 , . . . , πN form the N permutations
of a SeqCA(N ; t, v).
In the CSSP(8;3,5) of Table 1.1, the symbols {1, 2, 3} appear as 123 once, 132
once, 213 once, 231 zero times, 312 four times, and 321 once. Hence the rows of a
completely t-scrambling set of permutations do not necessarily produce a sequence
covering array; nevertheless they are conjugates, obtained by interchanging the roles
of columns and symbols.
Permutation problems concerning the avoidance of specified patterns of subsequences have been extensively studied in algebraic and probabilistic combinatorics;
see [33] for an excellent survey. (Here two subsequences (x1 , . . . , xt ) and (y1 , . . . , yt )
have the same pattern when, for 1 ≤ i < t, xi < xi+1 if and only if yi < yi+1 .)

While cosmetically similar to pattern avoidance problems, the existence problem for
sequence covering arrays requires coverage rather than avoidance and requires that
all subsequences be covered and not simply every pattern.
The question of principal concern in this paper is as follows: Given t and v, what
is the smallest N for which a CSSP(N ; t, v) (equivalently, a SeqCA(N ; t, v)) exists?
Call this number SeqCAN(t, v). In the vernacular of completely t-scrambling sets
of permutations, Spencer [32] did the foundational work, and Füredi [17], Ishigami
[20, 21], Radhakrishnan [31], and Tarui [36] made improvements.
In a sequence covering
every t symbols must appear in each of the t! possible
"
! array,
orderings, and there are vt t! t-subsequences in total, so
t! ≤ SeqCAN(t, v) ≤

# $
v
t!
t

Both bounds are trivial, but the lower bound is the correct one when t = 2.
Lemma 1.2. SeqCAN(2, v) = 2 for all v ≥ 2.
Proof. Any permutation on v symbols and its reversal form a SeqCA(2; 2, v).
When t ≥ 3, neither bound is correct as v increases. Indeed the growth as a
function of v for fixed t is logarithmic.

log t!−1

The question of when SeqCAN(t, v) = t! is of independent interest in yet another
setting. Let V be a finite set; an element of V is a vertex. A transitive tournament on
V is a directed graph in which (1) for all x ∈ V , (x, x) is not an arc; (2) for distinct
x, y ∈ V , (x, y) is an arc if and only if (y, x) is not an arc; and (3) whenever (x, y)
and (y, z) are arcs, so is (x, z). A transitive tournament T = (V, A) has transitive
tournament T ′ = (W, B) as a subdigraph, denoted T ′ ≺ T , whenever W ⊆ V and
B ⊆ A. Let (V, T ) be a finite set V of cardinality v and a collection T with every
T ∈ T being a transitive tournament on k of the vertices in V ; members of T are blocks.
Then (V, T ) is a (t, λ)-directed packing of blocksize k and order v, or DPλ (t, k, v), if
for every X ⊆ V with |X| = t and every transitive tournament T ′ on vertex set X,
|{T ∈ T : T ′ ≺ T }| ≤ λ.
On the other hand, (V, T ) is a (t, λ)-directed covering of blocksize k and order v, or
DCλ (t, k, v)), if for every X ⊆ V with |X| = t and every transitive tournament T ′ on
vertex set X,
|{T ∈ T : T ′ ≺ T }| ≥ λ.
When (V, T ) is a DPλ (t, k, v) and also a DCλ (t, k, v), it is a (t, λ)-directed design
of blocksize k and order v, or DDλ (t, k, v). In this notation, the subscript is often
omitted when λ = 1.
Directed designs with t = 2 have been extensively studied as generalizations of
balanced incomplete block designs. The study of (t, 1)-directed packings has also
been extensive as a result of their equivalence to “deletion-correcting codes” (see
Levenshtein [25]). The connection with our investigation follows.

SEQUENCE COVERING ARRAYS

1847

Lemma 1.4. A CSSP(N ; t, v) is equivalent to a DC(t, v, v) with N blocks. Moreover, a DD(t, v, v) exists if and only if SeqCAN(t, v) = t!.
Proof. For each row (a0 , . . . , av−1 ) of the CSSP, form a transitive tournament on
vertex set {0, . . . , v − 1} by including, for 0 ≤ i < j < v, arc (i, j) if ai < aj and arc
(j, i) otherwise. Each transitive tournament on t of these vertices is a subdigraph of
at least one of these N tournaments. The other direction is similar. When N = t!,
every t-subsequence is covered exactly once, and every transitive tournament of order
t arises as a subdigraph exactly once.
Theorem 1.5. Suﬃcient conditions for a DD(t, v, v) to exist include
1. t ≥ 3 and t ≤ v ≤ t + 1 [25] and
2. t = 4 and v = 6 [28].
Necessary conditions for a DD(t, v, v) to exist include
1. v ≤ t + 1 for t ∈ {3, 5, 6} [28],
2. v ≤ t! + 2" for t = 4 [28], and
− 1 for t ≥ 7 [28].
3. v ≤ t+1
2
Levenshtein [25] had conjectured that v ≤ t + 1 whenever a DD(t, v, v) exists for
t ≥ 3. As stated in Theorem 1.5, this does not hold for t = 4, but this is the only
known exception to Levenshtein’s conjecture. In the next section we significantly
reduce the upper bound on the largest v for which SeqCAN(t, v) can equal t!.
2. Lower bounds. Here we extend a technique used in [17, Theorem 5.1], improving on a method of Ishigami [21]. We require a number of previous results on
covering arrays, introduced next. See [8] for a more thorough introduction to them.
Let N , k, t, and v be positive integers. Let C be an N × k array with entries from
an alphabet Σ of size v; we typically take Σ = {0, . . . , v − 1}. When (ν1 , . . . , νt )
is a t-tuple with νi ∈ Σ for 1 ≤ i ≤ t, (c1 , . . . , ct ) is a tuple of t column indices
(ci ∈ {1, . . . , k}), and ci ̸= cj whenever νi ̸= νj , the t-tuple {(ci , νi ) : 1 ≤ i ≤ t} is a
t-way interaction. The array covers the t-way interaction {(ci , νi ) : 1 ≤ i ≤ t} if, in
at least one row ρ of C, the entry in row ρ and column ci is νi for 1 ≤ i ≤ t. Array
C is a covering array CA(N ; t, k, v) of strength t if it covers every t-way interaction.
CAN(t, k, v) is the minimum N for which a CA(N ; t, k, v) exists. The basic goal is to
minimize the number of rows (tests) required and hence to determine CAN(t, k, v).
When t ≥ 2 and v ≥ 2 are both fixed, CAN(t, k, v) is Θ(log k) (see, for example, [8]).
We strengthen this standard definition somewhat. For a t-way interaction T =
{(ci , νi ) : 1 ≤ i ≤ t} with symbols chosen from Σ = {0, . . . , v − 1}, let τσ (T ) =
'
|{i : νi = σ}|. Then define µ(T ) = v−1
σ=0 τσ (T )!. The natural interpretation is that
µ(T ) is the number of ways to permute the columns (c1 , . . . , ct ) so that the symbols
appear in the same order. A covering array provides excess coverage when every tway interaction T is covered by at least µ(T ) rows; such a covering array is denoted
by CAX (N ; t, k, v). More generally, the subscript X is used to extend notation from
covering arrays to those having excess coverage.
Theorem 2.1. Let v, t, and a be integers satisfying v ≥ t ≥ 3 and t ≥ a ≥ 0.
Then SeqCAN(t, v) ≥ a!CANX (t − a, v − a, a + 1).
Proof. Let S be a CSSP(N ; t, v). Choose any a columns of S, {e1 , . . . , ea }. For
each ordering π of these columns, form a matrix Cπ that contains all rows of S in
which the entry in column π(ei ) is less than that in column π(ei+1 ) for 1 ≤ i < a.
Because there are a! orderings and every row of S appears in exactly one of the {Cπ },
it suﬃces to show that for every choice of π the number n of rows in Cπ is at least
CANX (t − a, v − a, a + 1). To do this, form an n × (v − a) array Aπ whose columns
are the columns of Cπ that are not among the a selected. To determine the content of

cell (r, c) of Aπ , examine the symbol σ in column c and row r of Cπ . If σ is less than
the symbol in row r and column π(e1 ), the entry is set to 0. If σ is greater than the
symbol in row r and column π(ea ), the entry is set to a. Otherwise find the unique j
for which σ is greater than the symbol in row r and column π(ej ) but less than the
symbol in row r and column π(ej+1 ), and set the entry to j.
Now we claim that Aπ is a CAX (n; t − a, v − a, a + 1). The verification requires
demonstrating that every (t − a)-way interaction T is covered at least µ(T ) times. So
let T = {(fi , νi ) : 1 ≤ i ≤ t − a}, noting that νi ∈ {0, . . . , a} and fi indexes a column
of A. We form permutations of {e1 , . . . , ea } ∪ {f1 , . . . , ft−a } that are consistent with
π on {e1 , . . . , ea } in that these columns appear in the order prescribed by π. To
do this, there are τ0 (T ) columns with entry 0; place one of the τ0 (T )! orderings of
these columns so that all appear before π(e1 ). There are τa (T ) columns with entry
a; place one of the τa (T )! orderings of these columns so that all appear after π(ea ).
For 1 ≤ j < a, there are τj (T ) columns with entry j; place one of the τj (T )! orderings
of these columns so that all appear before π(ej ) and after π(ej+1 ). In this way we
can form µ(T ) permutations of {e1 , . . . , ea } ∪ {f1 , . . . , ft−a }, each consistent with π.
Because each is consistent with π, it appears in Cπ . But each such appearance in Cπ
results in a diﬀerent row of A that covers T , and hence T is indeed covered at least
µ(T ) times.
The easiest applications of Theorem 2.1 result from using CAN(t, k, v) as a lower
bound for CANX (t, k, v). Apply it with a = t − 1, noting that CAN(1, k, t) = t for
all k ≥ 1, to recover the trivial lower bound that SeqCAN(t, v) ≥ t!. Apply it with
a = t − 2 to establish that SeqCAN(t, v) ≥ (t − 2)!CAN(2, v − t + 2, t − 1).
Now we return to the question of when SeqCAN(t, v) can equal t!, or equivalently when a DD(t, v, v) can exist. Theorem 2.1 ensures that SeqCAN(t, v) ≥
(t − 2)!CANX (2, v − t + 2, t − 1), so SeqCAN(t, v) = t! can hold only when CANX (2, v −
t + 2, t − 1) ≤ t(t − 1). The 2-way interaction T = {(c1 , ν1 ), (c2 , ν2 )} has µ(T ) = 2
exactly when ν1 = ν2 (called a constant pair) and has µ(T ) = 1 otherwise (a nonconstant pair). Because, for each pair of columns, t − 1 constant pairs must be covered
twice each, and (t − 1)(t − 2) nonconstant pairs must be covered at least once each,
CANX (2, v − t + 2, t − 1) ≥ t(t − 1). So we are concerned with when equality can hold.
Lemma 2.2. For v ≥ 4, CANX (2, k, v) = v(v + 1) only if k ≤ v + 2.
Proof. Suppose that a CAX (v(v + 1); 2, k, v) exists with columns indexed by
{1, . . . , k} and symbols by {0, . . . , v − 1}. We form sets on symbols V = ({1, . . . , k} ×
{0, . . . , v − 1}) ∪ {∞}. The system of sets (blocks) B is formed as follows. For every
row (x1 , . . . , xk ) of the covering array, a set {(i, xi ) : 1 ≤ i ≤ k} is placed in B.
Then for every 1 ≤ i ≤ k, a set {(i, j) : 0 ≤ j < v} ∪ {∞} is placed in B. The set
system (V, B) has kv + 1 symbols and v(v + 1) + k blocks. By construction, every two
diﬀerent symbols appear together in exactly one block, unless the pair is of the form
{(i, j), (i′ , j)} corresponding to a constant pair and therefore occurring in exactly two
blocks.
Now form a (kv + 1) × (v(v + 1) + k) matrix A, which is the symbol-block incidence
matrix, as follows. Rows are indexed by symbols, columns by blocks. The matrix
contains the entry 1 in row r and column c when symbol r appears in block c and 0
otherwise. Now examine B = AAT , which has rows and columns indexed by V . Its
diagonal entries are k in entry (∞, ∞) and v + 2 elsewhere. Its oﬀ-diagonal entries
are 2 in cells indexed by ((i, j), (i′ , j)) with i ̸= i′ and 1 otherwise.
The rank of B cannot exceed the number of columns in A, namely, v(v + 1) + k.
So in order to bound k, we bound the rank of B.

SEQUENCE COVERING ARRAYS

Write D = B − J. The rows indexed by V \ {∞} can be partitioned into v parts;
a part is formed by including all rows and columns with indices {(i, j) : 1 ≤ i ≤ k}
for some j with 0 ≤ j < v. Then D can be written as a block diagonal matrix with v
k × k block matrices each equal to X = vI + J and a single 1 × 1 block matrix with
entry k − 1. Now det(D) = (k − 1)(det(X))v , and det(X) = v k (1 + kv ) by the matrix
determinant lemma. Hence rank(D) = kv + 1. Because B is obtained from D by a
rank one update, rank(B) ≥ kv.
Consequently, kv ≤ v(v + 1) + k, or k ≤ v(v+1)
v−1 . Thus k ≤ v + 2 when v ≥ 4,
because k is an integer.
This enables us to establish a substantial improvement on the bound of Mathon
and Tran Van Trung [28] stated in Theorem 1.5.
Theorem 2.3. If t ≥ 3 and SeqCAN(t, v) = t! (or equivalently, a DD(t, v, v)
exists), then v ≤ 2t − 1.
Proof. If 3 ≤ t ≤ 6, this follows from Theorem 1.5. By Theorem 2.1, t! =
SeqCAN(t, v) ≥ (t − 2)!CANX (2, v − t + 2, t − 1) and thus CANX (2, v − t + 2, t − 1) =
t(t − 1). By Lemma 2.2, v − t − 2 ≤ t − 1 + 2 and hence v ≤ 2t − 1 as required.
It appears plausible that the bound should be t+2 rather than 2t−1; nevertheless,
the method here gives the first bound that is linear in t.

method that selects a set of N permutations on v symbols uniformly at random;
we explore this first.

3.1. One permutation at a time. Lemma 3.1 provides a useful upper bound
on the size of completely t-scrambling sets of permutations but does not provide
an eﬀective method to find such arrays. Stein [34], Lovász [26], and Johnson [22]
develop a general strategy for finding solutions to covering problems; this algorithm
has been shown to lead to polynomial time methods in many combinatorial covering
problems [3, 4, 7, 9, 10]. We extend that strategy here to treat sequence covering
arrays.
The basic approach is greedy. Repeatedly select one permutation to add that
covers a large number of as-yet-uncovered t-subsequences, until all are covered. Stein
[34], Lovász [26], and Johnson [22] each suggest selecting to maximize the number of
newly covered elements, but their analyses require only that the next selection cover
at least the average. If after i permutations are selected there remain Ui uncovered
t-subsequences, then a permutation selected uniformly at random is expected to cover
Ui t!1 t-subsequences for the first time. Provided that we select the (i+1)st permutation
to cover at least Ui t!1 t-subsequences for the first time, we have that Ui+1 ≤ Ui t!−1

value for which UN < 1; then there must be a sequence covering array with N
permutations.
This simply restates the argument of Lemma 3.1, but with two important improvements. It derandomizes the method by ensuring that appropriate selection of
each permutation guarantees that the bound is met, rather than asserting the existence of a set of permutations that meets it. More importantly, the time to construct
the sequence covering array is polynomial in the number of permutations and the time
to select a permutation that covers at least the average.
For fixed t the number of permutations is logarithmic in v, and so an algorithm
with running time polynomial in v will result if we can select the next permutation
in time polynomial in v. Because the details are quite similar to earlier approaches,
we merely outline how this can be done.
Suppose that U consists of the as-yet-uncovered t-subsequences. For U ∈ U,
let cov(π, U ) = 1 when π covers U , and cov(π, U ) = 0 otherwise. Let R be an rsubsequence; the r symbols in R are fixed, and the remaining v − r are free. There
is a set PR of v!
r! permutations that cover R. We focus on the expected number of
members of U that are covered by a member of PR chosen uniformly at random;
this is
r! ( (
ec(R) =
cov(π, U ).
v!
π∈PR U∈U

The strategy is to find a sequence of subsequences P0 , . . . , Pv , so that Pi is an
i-subsequence, Pi+1 covers Pi for 0 ≤ i < v, symbol i is free in Pi but fixed in Pi+1 ,
and ec(Pi+1 ) ≥ ec(Pi ) for 0 ≤ i < v. Because ec(P0 ) = t!1 |U|, it follows that Pv is a
permutation that covers at least t!1 |U| of the as-yet-uncovered t-subsequences. Given
a selection of Pi , there are precisely i + 1 candidates {C1 , . . . , Ci+1 } for Pi+1 obtained
by placing symbol i in one of the i + 1 positions of Pi . Our task is to choose one for
which ec(Cj ) ≥ ec(Pi ), in order to set Pi+1 = Cj .
A naive computation of ec(Cj ) would enumerate members of U and of PCj ,
but)the latter may have size exponential in v. Instead, for U ∈ U let ec(U, R) =
r!
π∈PR cov(π, U ), and observe that
v!
(
ec(U, R).
ec(R) =
U∈U

When t is fixed, U contains fewer than v t subsequences, which is polynomial
in v. Therefore it suﬃces to compute ec(U, R) eﬃciently, given a t-subsequence U
and an r-subsequence R. Let τ be the number of symbols appearing in both U and
R. When the τ symbols in common do not appear in the same order in U and R,
ec(U, R) = 0. Otherwise let T be the τ -subsequence that they have in common. Then
ec(U, R) = ec(U, T ) = τt!! .
)i+1
1
The key observation in selecting Pi+1 is that ec(Pi ) = i+1
j=1 ec(Cj ). Computing ec(Cj ) for 1 ≤ j ≤ i + 1, and selecting Pi+1 to be the one that maximizes ec(Cj ),
we are then sure that ec(Pi+1 ) ≥ ec(Pi ).
Combining all of these arguments, we have established the next theorem.

SeqCA(N ; t, v) having N ≤ 1 + (log( (v−t)!

This algorithm can be easily implemented, and we report results from it in
section 5. One immediate improvement results from observing that the counts of

as-yet-uncovered t-subsequences (R0 , R1 , . . . , RN ) must be integers. Hence we have
that Ri+1 ≤ ⌊Ri t!−1
t! ⌋. In specific cases this improves on the bound, without the need
to construct the sequence covering array. If, however, the sequence covering array
is explicitly constructed, at each selection of Pi+1 from Pi , we can choose Pi+1 to
maximize ec() among the i + 1 candidates.
3.2. Greedy methods with reversals. The methods developed are greedy in
that they attempt to cover the largest number of as-yet-uncovered t-subsequences.
The very first permutation chosen is arbitrary; all are equally eﬀective at coverage.
Once one is selected, however, there is a genuine choice for the second. Greedy
selection indicates that we should choose one that covers no t-subsequence already
covered by the first. Indeed when t = 2, choosing the reversal of this first covers all
remaining t-subsequences.
For t ≥ 3, suppose that we have chosen 2s permutations π1 , . . . , π2s , and suppose
further that π2i is the reverse of π2i−1 for 1 ≤ i ≤ s. It follows that the number of
as-yet-uncovered t-subsequences covered by a permutation π is precisely the same as
the number covered by the reverse of π. Yet π and its reverse never cover the same
t-subsequence. Hence if the algorithm were to select π next, the reverse of π remains
an equally beneficial choice immediately thereafter. Therefore a useful variant of the
algorithm developed, after adding a permutation π to the array, always adds the
reverse of π as well. Pursuing this, we obtain the following.
Theorem 3.3. For fixed t and input v, there is an algorithm to construct a
v!
t!
))/(log( t!−2
)) permutations in time that is
SeqCA(N ; t, v) having N ≤ 2(log( (v−t)!
polynomial in v.
Naturally, we could again obtain small improvements in practice because every
count of as-yet-uncovered t-subsequences is an integer.
In principle, always including reversals improves slightly on the bound (that is,
Theorem 3.3 improves on Theorem 3.2). Whether this is a practical improvement
remains to be seen; we return to this point.
4. Product constructions. Product (or “cut-and-paste” or “Roux-type”) constructions are well studied for covering arrays; see, for example, [11, 6]. We develop
a product construction for completely 3-scrambling sets of permutations. To do this,
we first introduce an auxiliary property. A signing of a CSSP(N ; t, v) A = (aij ) is an
N × v matrix S = (sij ) with entries {↑, ↓}. A CSSP(N ; t, v) A is properly signed by
an N × v matrix S with entries {↑, ↓}. When for every set of t − 1 distinct columns
c1 , . . . , ct−1 , each sign s ∈ {↑, ↓}, and every permutation π of 1, . . . , t − 1, there exists
a row ρ of A for which, for every 1 ≤ a < b < t, the entry in cell (ρ, cπ(a) ) is less than
the entry in row (ρ, cπ(b) ), and the sign sρ,c1 = s. A properly signed CSSP(7;3,5) is
shown in Table 4.1.
We defer for the moment the question of how to sign a completely t-scrambling
set of permutations.
4.1. Products for strength three.
Theorem 4.1. If a properly signed CSSP(N ; 3, v) and a properly signed
CSSP(M ; 3, w) both exist, so does a properly signed CSSP(N + M ; 3, vw).
Proof. Let A = (aij ) be a CSSP(N ; 3, v) having sign matrix S = (sij ) with columns
indexed by {0, . . . , v − 1}. Let B = (bij ) be a CSSP(M ; 3, w) having sign matrix T =
(tij ) with columns indexed by {0, . . . , w − 1}. Form an array C = (cρ,(i,j) ) on N + M
rows and vw columns with columns indexed by {0, . . . , v − 1} × {0, . . . , w − 1}. In row
ρ for 1 ≤ ρ ≤ N , in column (i, j), place the entry aρi w + j if sρi =↑, aρi w + (w − 1 − j)

tρj =↑, bρj v + (v − 1 − i) if tρj =↓.
To show that C is a CSSP(N + M ; 3, vw), we must establish that every 3subsequence is covered. Consider three columns (i1 , j1 ), (i2 , j2 ), (i3 , j3 ), in this order. If i1 , i2 , and i3 are all distinct, there is a row ρ of A in which aρi1 < aρi2 < aρi3 .
Then in C row ρ has the three specified columns in the chosen order. By the same
token, if j1 , j2 , and j3 are all distinct, there is a row ρ of B in which bρj1 < bρj2 < bρj3 .
Then in C row ρ + N has the three specified columns in the chosen order. If {i1 , i2 , i3 }
contains only one element, {j1 , j2 , j3 } contains three distinct elements; symmetrically,
if {j1 , j2 , j3 } contains only one element, {i1 , i2 , i3 } contains three distinct elements.
So it remains only to treat cases in which both {i1 , i2 , i3 } and {j1 , j2 , j3 } contain two
distinct elements.
Now suppose that the three columns are {(i1 , j1 ), (i1 , j2 ), (i2 , j1 )}; we are concerned with the six orderings of the elements {c(i1 ,j1 ) , c(i1 ,j2 ) , c(i2 ,j1 ) }, which we represent by giving the indices in the sorted order for {c(i1 ,j1 ) , c(i1 ,j2 ) , c(i2 ,j1 ) }, as shown
next.

Table 4.2 gives the rows in which each of the six orderings is covered; we use
sgn(x − y) to be ↓ if x < y, ↑ if x > y. Two of the orderings are covered at least
twice.
To sign C properly, assign ↑ to each entry in each of the first N rows and ↓ to
each entry in each of the last M rows.
A small example, combining two CSSP(6;3,4)s to form a CSSP(12;3,16), is shown

Lemma 4.3. Whenever a CSSP(N ; t, v) exists, a properly signed CSSP(N ; t, v −1)
exists.
Proof. Let A = (aij ) be a CSSP(N ; t, v). Form an N × (v − 1) array S = (sij )
with sij = sgn(aij − ai,v−1 ). Form an N × (v − 1) array B = (bij ) with bij = aij if
aij < ai,v−1 and bij = aij − 1 otherwise. Then B is a CSSP(N ; t, v − 1) that is properly
signed by S.
Let A be a CSSP(N ; t, v) and A1 , A2 be arrays that partition the rows of A. When,
for i = 1, 2, Ai is a CSSP(Ni ; t − 1, v), A is a partitionable CSSP.
Lemma 4.4. Whenever a partitionable CSSP(N ; t, v) exists, a properly signed
CSSP(N ; t, v) exists.
Proof. Let A be a CSSP(N ; t, v) with partition A1 , A2 . Assign sign ↑ to every
entry of A1 and ↓ to every entry of A2 .
Corollary 4.5. Whenever a CSSP(N ; 3, v) contains a row and its reverse, it is
partitionable and hence can be properly signed.
Proof. Place the row and its reverse in A1 and all other rows in A2 . Then A1 is a
CSSP(N ; 2, v). Moreover, A2 is a CSSP(N ; 2, v) because for every i, j ∈ {0, . . . , v − 1}
with i ̸= j, in A there are at least three rows in which the entry in column i is less
than that in column j. Then A is partitionable, so apply Lemma 4.4.

Lemma 4.4 provides a suﬃcient condition for a CSSP(N ; 3, v) to have a proper
signing but considers only signings in which all entries in each row receive the same
sign. Column c is properly signed when, for every set of t − 1 distinct columns
c1 , c2 , . . . , ct−1 with c1 = c, each sign s ∈ {+, −}, and every permutation π of
1, . . . , t − 1, there exists a row ρ of A for which, for every 1 ≤ a < b < t, the entry in cell (ρ, cπ(a) ) is less than the entry in row (ρ, cπ(b) ), and the sign sρ,c = s.
Properly signing the N × v array A is equivalent to properly signing each column of
A; the important fact is that signs assigned in one column are unrelated to signs in
any other, and so one can (hope to) proceed by signing each column separately.
Consider the case of strength t = 3. What does it mean to properly sign a
specific column c? For every column i other than c we form two sets: Ai contains
the row indices in which the entry in column i is larger than that in column c, and
Bi (= {1, . . . , N }\Ai ) contains the row indices in which the entry in column i is smaller
than that in column c. We can consider these sets as the edges of a hypergraph H on
vertex set {1, . . . , N }. Then H has 2v − 2 edges each containing at least three vertices
and a proper 2-coloring of H corresponds to a proper signing of c. Lemma 4.4 and
Corollary 4.5 give proper 2-colorings. In all examples that we have examined, each
column can be properly signed by finding a suitable 2-coloring. Hence it is plausible
that every CSSP(N ; 3, v) can be properly signed, but if this is true the proof is elusive
at the moment.
5. Computational results. In [23], a simple greedy method is used to compute
upper bounds on SeqCAN(t, v) for t ∈ {3, 4} and small values of v. These are reported
in column K in Tables 5.1 and 5.2. Results from a more sophisticated greedy method
by Erdem et al. [16] are reported in column ER. Using techniques from constraint
satisfaction, in particular answer set programming, much more sophisticated search
methods have been applied to strengths three and four [1, 2, 16]. Banbara, Tamura,
and Inoue [1] implement an answer set programming method and show bounds for
SeqCAN(3, v) for v ≤ 80 and for SeqCAN(4, v) for v ≤ 23. These bounds appear in
column BTI in Tables 5.1 and 5.2. Results by Brain et al. [2] are reported in column
BR in Tables 5.1 and 5.2. In [18], bounds for t ∈ {3, 4, 5} and v ≤ 10 are reported
from a method called the “bees algorithm”; these oﬀer modest improvements on the
greedy method in [23]. We do not report them for t ∈ {3, 4} because they are not
competitive with the results in [1]; we do report them for t = 5 in column BA, because
they are the only published computational results. When t = 3, Tarui [36] establishes
"
!
) ≤ q for all q ≥ 4; these are reported in
by direct construction that SeqCAN(3, ⌊q/2⌋

column TA.
The bound U is obtained by computing the number Ui of as-yet-uncovered tsubsequences using Ui+1 = ⌊ t!−1
t! Ui ⌋ and terminating with the first value N for which
UN = 0. (This does not explicitly construct the array but rather yields a number of
rows for which it can surely be produced.) In the same manner, bound UR is obtained
by including reversals, so that Ui+2 = Ui − 2⌈ t!1 Ui ⌉ when i is even. The bound D is
obtained by applying the algorithm that establishes Theorem 3.2 and that of DR by
applying the algorithm that establishes Theorem 3.3.
Table 5.1 reports results for t = 3. The theoretical results indicate that including
reversals accelerates coverage, and so the bound UR improves on the bound U. Neither
is competitive with greedy bounds from [23], given by K. In turn these are improved
upon by the greedy method from [16], given by ER. Implementing our greedy approach
nevertheless results in useful improvement to the two earlier greedy bounds, whether
reversals are included or not. It comes as no surprise that the answer set programming

methods from [1, 2] (BTI, BR) yield consistent improvements on all the greedy methods
for strength three. However, the direct construction of Tarui [36] provides better
results at this time whenever v ≥ 30.
Perhaps the most perplexing pattern is the regularity with which D yields a better
bound than does DR . Remarkably, we consistently produce smaller sequence covering
arrays when we do not automatically include reversals! The reasons for this are quite
unclear at the present time.
Table 5.2 gives results for strengths four and five. For strength four, our improvements on the method from [23] are more dramatic than for strength three. Surprisingly, the answer set programming technique from [1] obtains a better result than our
greedy methods only when v ≤ 8. For 9 ≤ v ≤ 23, our greedy method yields much
smaller arrays. (For v = 23, we employ 98 permutations as opposed to the 112 in
BTI.) A similar comparison applies with the results from [2, 16] reported in column BR.
Of course, we expect that given enough time, the answer set programming techniques
would improve upon our greedy bounds.
However, our methods require polynomial time in theory and are eﬀective in
practice for larger problems than those considered in [2, 1]; despite these “limitations,”
our methods appear to yield better results within the time available.

A somewhat diﬀerent pattern with respect to reversals is evident for strength
four: The theoretical bound profits by including reversals throughout, but the implemented construction method appears first to benefit from reversals (for v ≤ 20)
but later no longer benefit (for 40 ≤ v ≤ 90). Again the reasons for this are unclear.
When v = 90, our methods track the coverage of 61,324,560 4-subsequences; thus,
while the methods scale polynomially with v, the computations are nonetheless quite
extensive. There is a CSSP(24;4,6) [28], but our methods do not yield fewer than 32
permutations.
For strength five, none of the published methods in [1, 16, 23] report computational results, so it is diﬃcult to make any comments about relative accuracy. However, the answer set programming methods do appear to require substantially more
storage, which limits to a degree their eﬀective range. To apply our methods would
require tracking the coverage of 78,960,960 5-subsequences for v = 40; despite the
eﬃciency of our methods, a straightforward implementation encounters both storage
and time limitations. The method BA [18] is not competitive with our greedy methods.
Within the range computed, including reversals improves our results. The pattern
thereafter is unknown. Again, there is a CSSP(120;5,6) [25], but our methods do not
yield fewer than 148 permutations.

6. Using the product construction. For strength three, Theorem 4.1 provides
substantial improvements on the computational results from the greedy methods. We
properly signed a CSSP(6;3,4) in Table 4.3 and a CSSP(7;3,5) in Table 4.1. Table 6.1
shows proper signings for further arrays from [1].
We obtain CSSP(N ; 3, v) for (v, N ) ∈ {(40, 15), (80, 17), (128, 18), (160, 19),
(256, 20), (288, 21)} by using these in Theorem 4.1. These improve upon all the computational results! For example, while in [1] it is shown that SeqCAN(3, 80) ≤ 24
and in [2] that SeqCAN(3, 80) ≤ 23, here it is shown that SeqCAN(3, 80) ≤ 17. The
examples given also provide better bounds than those of Tarui [36], but Theorem 4.1
does not outperform the direct construction asymptotically.
7. Constraints. In the testing application, it may happen that not every permutation of the events can in fact be executed; see [2, 23, 24]. It is therefore reasonable to ask how constraints on the execution order aﬀect the number of permutations needed and how they aﬀect the diﬃculty of finding a sequence covering array. We briefly consider the latter, in order to examine connections with further
problems.
Let Σ = {0, . . . , v − 1}. Let C be a set of subpermutations of Σ, called constraints.
A constrained sequence covering array SeqCA(N ; t, v, C) is a set Π = {π1 , . . . , πN }
where πi is a permutation of Σ that does not cover any subpermutation in C, and
every t-subsequence of Σ that does not cover any subpermutation in C is covered by
at least one of the permutations {π1 , . . . , πN }.
Even in the easiest case, when t = 2 and all constraints are 2-subpermutations,
the nature of the problem changes dramatically. Imposing the subpermutation constraint that b cannot precede a is the same as enforcing the precedence constraint that
a precede b. When the precedence constraints contain a cycle, it is impossible to meet
all constraints. This can be easily checked. When the constraints are acyclic, there is
a permutation that covers no constraint. However, covering all 2-subpermutations not
in C requires more. Let C r be the set of 2-subpermutations obtained by reversing each
2-subpermutation in C. Suppose that a SeqCA(N ; 2, v, C) exists. Every permutation
in the sequence covering array covers every 2-subpermutation in C r . Equivalently,
treating C r as a partial order, every permutation gives a linear extension of the partial order. When (a, b) ∈ C, (b, a) must be covered by every permutation in the
sequence covering array. When {(a, b), (b, a)} ∩ C = ∅, some but not all permutations
in the sequence covering array cover (a, b)—and the rest cover (b, a). Hence the set
of 2-subpermutations covered by every permutation in the sequence covering array
is exactly C r . This establishes a connection with the theory of partial orders. The
dimension of a partial order is the smallest number of linear extensions whose intersection is the partial order [37, 38]. Our discussion establishes that a SeqCA(N ; 2, v, C)
exists if and only if the dimension of the partial order induced by C r is at most N .
Hence we have the next lemma.
Lemma 7.1. Deciding whether a SeqCA(N ; 2, v, C) exists is NP-complete, even
when C is an acyclic set of 2-subpermutations.
Proof. Yannakakis [41] shows that determining whether a partial order has dimension at most 3 is NP-complete.
Brain et al. [2] establish the NP-completeness of a related problem in which the
subsequences to be covered, the constraints, and the permutations allowed are all
specified. Lemma 7.1 is in stark contrast with the existence of sequence covering
arrays of strength two without constraints. Nevertheless, the complexity arises in
determining whether a small sequence covering array exists in these cases, not in

determining whether a sequence covering array exists. The situation is worse when
constraints have strength three.
Consider a collection T of ordered triples of distinct elements of Σ, and associate with (a, b, c) the constraints {(b, a, c), (b, c, a), (a, c, b), (c, a, b)}. Meeting these
constraints requires that b lie between a and c, and a collection of constraints of this
type forms an instance of the betweenness problem [5] in which one is required to

SEQUENCE COVERING ARRAYS

order all items so that for every triple (a, b, c) ∈ T , b lies between a and c. Forming
C = {(b, a, c), (b, c, a), (a, c, b), (c, a, b) : (a, b, c) ∈ T }, even finding a single permutation that covers no 3-subpermutation in C appears hard:
Lemma 7.2 (see [30]). Determining whether an instance of the betweenness problem has a solution is NP-complete.
These complexity results suggest that constraints pose severe additional challenges
in the construction of sequence covering arrays. Checking feasibility can become diﬃcult; even when feasibility is easily checked, the minimization problem is substantially
more complicated.
8. Conclusions. The close connection between sequence covering arrays and
covering arrays has proved useful in establishing bounds on the sizes of sequence covering arrays. The eﬃcient conditional expectation algorithm for generating sequence
covering arrays and the product construction for strength three parallel analogous
results for covering arrays. Unfortunately, while sequence covering arrays lead to
covering arrays with excess coverage, additional conditions on such a covering array
would be required in order to recover a sequence covering array. Hence the parallels
between the extensive literature on covering arrays and the existence problem for
sequence covering arrays are primarily by analogy.
We have examined numerous formulations for sequence covering arrays. In closing, we indicate one more (see also [27]). A perfect hash family PHF(N ; k, w, t) is an
N × k array on w symbols in which in every N × t subarray, at least one row consists
of distinct symbols. Mehlhorn [29] introduced perfect hash families as an eﬃcient tool
for compact storage and fast retrieval of frequently used information; see also [14].
Stinson et al. [35] establish that perfect hash families can be used to construct separating systems, key distribution patterns, group testing algorithms, cover-free families,
and secure frameproof codes. They are also used extensively in product constructions
for covering arrays [8, 12, 13]. Completely t-scrambling sets of permutations can be
viewed as an ordered analogue of perfect hash families in which k = w, no element
appears twice in a row, and for every way to select t distinct columns in order there is
a row in which the elements in these columns are in increasing order. In particular, a
completely t-scrambling set of permutations provides a perfect hash family in which,
for every set of t columns, there are at least t! rows containing distinct symbols in the
chosen columns, and at least one for each of the t! symbol orderings. For this reason,
it appears reasonable to expect that constructions for perfect hash families may also
prove to be useful for sequence covering arrays.
