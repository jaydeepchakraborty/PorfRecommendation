ABSTRACT

Seasonal nitrification breakdown is a major problem in wastewater treatment plants
which makes it difficult for the plant operators to meet discharge limits. The present
study focused on understanding the seasonal impact of environmental and operational
parameters on nitrifiers and nitrification, in a biological nutrient removal wastewater
treatment works situated in the midlands of KwaZulu Natal.
Composite sludge samples (from the aeration tank), influent and effluent water
samples were collected twice a month for 237 days. A combination of fluorescent insitu hybridization, polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-clone library, quantitative
polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) were employed for characterizing and quantifying
the dominant nitrifiers in the plant. In order to have more insight into the activated
sludge community structure, pyrosequencing was used in profiling the amoA locus of
ammonia oxidizing bacteria (AOB) community whilst Illumina sequencing was used
in characterising the plant’s total bacterial community. The nonlinear effect of
operating parameters and environmental conditions on nitrification was also
investigated using an adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS), Pearson’s
correlation coefficient and quadratic models.
The plant operated with higher MLSS of 6157±783 mg/L during the first phase
(winter) whilst it was 4728±1282 mg/L in summer. The temperature recorded in the
aeration tanks ranged from 14.2oC to 25.1oC during the period. The average ammonia
removal during winter was 60.0±18% whereas it was 83±13% during summer and this
was found to correlate with temperature (r = 0.7671; P = 0.0008). A significant
correlation was also found between the AOB (amoA gene) copy numbers and
temperature in the reactors (α= 0.05; P=0.05), with the lowest AOB abundance
recorded during winter. Sanger sequencing analysis indicated that the dominant
nitrifiers

were

Nitrosomonas

spp.

Nitrobacter

spp.

and

Nitrospira

spp.

Pyrosequencing revealed significant differences in the AOB population which was 6
times higher during summer compared to winter. The AOB sequences related to

iii

uncultured bacterium and uncultured AOB also showed an increase of 133% and 360%
respectively when the season changed from winter to summer. This study suggests that
vast population of novel, ecologically significant AOB species, which remain
unexploited, still inhabit the complex activated sludge communities. Based on ANFIS
model, AOB increased during summer season, when temperature was 1.4-fold higher
than winter (r 0.517, p 0.048), and HRT decreased by 31% as a result of rainfall (r 0.741, p 0.002). Food: microorganism ratio (F/M) and HRT formed the optimal
combination of two inputs affecting the plant’s specific nitrification (qN), and their
quadratic equation showed r2-value of 0.50.
This study has significantly contributed towards understanding the complex
relationship between the microbial population dynamics, wastewater composition and
nitrification performance in a full-scale treatment plant situated in the subtropical
region. This is the first study applying ANFIS technique to describe the nitrification
performance at a full-scale WWTP, subjected to dynamic operational parameters. The
study also demonstrated the successful application of ANFIS for determining and
ranking the impact of various operating parameters on plant’s nitrification
performance, which could not be achieved by the conventional spearman correlation
due to the non-linearity of the interactions during wastewater treatment. Moreover, this
study also represents the first-time amoA gene targeted pyrosequencing of AOB in a
full-scale activated sludge is being done.

CHAPTER ONE: INTRODUCTION

Historically, the epidemics in London between 1831 and 1866, which resulted from
water pollution, necessitated the requirement of specific regulations on wastewater
treatment and discharge. This in turn prompted the construction and operation of
wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) and the eventual development of advanced
wastewater treatment technologies (Glicksman and Batzel, 2010; Sciampacone,
2013).The untreated wastewater is usually laden with high content of pollutants
(organic and inorganic) and pathogens. Discharging this untreated wastewater into
water bodies usually results in disruption of the normal ecological functioning of
aquatic ecosystems and widespread waterborne diseases (Holeton et al., 2011; Uan et
al., 2013). In aquatic environments, the inorganic nitrogen (NH3 and NO2-) and
phosphates at elevated levels (>0.05 mg/L) have been implicated to stimulate
eutrophication (WEF, 2009; Chuai et al., 2012). Even at low concentrations (<0.2
mg/L), the unionized ammonia has been reported to be acutely toxic to fish (Yang et
al., 2010; Chen et al., 2012). As a result, national governments around the globe have
environmental agencies saddled with the responsibility of enforcing compliance with
effluent discharge limits which includes dissolved organic carbon (biological or
chemical oxygen demand) as well as nitrogen compounds and phosphates (Holeton et
al., 2011).

Although there are biological and chemical ways of treating wastewater, the former is
usually the preferred choice as it is more environmentally friendly (Akpor and Muchie,
2010). Activated sludge, membrane bioreactors (MBRs), trickling filters, up-flow
anaerobic sludge blanket reactors, lagoons and artificial wetlands are the most
commonly used biological treatment processes for both industrial and domestic
wastewaters (Akpor and Muchie, 2010; Heffernan et al., 2011). Biological wastewater
treatment harnesses the ability of the microorganisms to metabolize the pollutants in

1

wastewater for synthesizing their cells’ building blocks. These bioreactors are
configured and operated in a way to select and enrich the specialized microbial
consortium that are required for nutrient removal (Lopez-Vazques, 2009). The
bioprocesses through which nutrients are transformed and removed within these
engineered systems depend on structure and concentration of the mixed microbial
community with nitrifiers occupying an important ecological niche within it (Graham
et al., 2007; Ozdemir et al., 2011).

Nitrification as a process is essential for nitrogen removal in biological nutrient
removing (BNR) systems (You and Lin, 2008; Ward, 2013). Nitrifying bacteria form
an important part of this ecological system and are responsible for ammonia
biotransformation and removal through nitrification. Nitrification process involves the
bioconversion of ammonia into nitrite by either ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) or
ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA) and subsequent conversion of nitrite to nitrate by
nitrite-oxidizing bacteria (NOB) (Bae et al., 2013; Ward, 2013). Nitrifiers are
‘vulnerably delicate’, with characteristic slow growth rate (Wei et al., 2013).
Nitrification, like any other process that hinges on microbial physiology, is subject to
failure whenever there is a shift in operational conditions or in the presence of toxic
compounds (Ducey et al., 2010). This shift may result in the loss of key microbial
populations which need to be replenished in order for the system to recover its
functional ability (Kim et al., 2011).

Nitrification process in BNR systems is usually limited by the nitrifiers’ physiological
activities (Zhang et al., 2011a; Dogan et al., 2014; Lotti et al., 2014). Monitoring the
nitrifiers, especially ammonia oxidizing bacteria (AOB) in wastewater treatment
systems, is therefore important in order to prevent nitrification failure (Siripong and
Rittmann, 2007). According to Gentile et al. (2007), it is important to understand how
the microbial communities correlates to system stability in a bid to design functionally
reliable wastewater treatment systems. The nitrifiers could serve as indicator
parameter for preventing washout of important functional groups in wastewater

2

treatment facility. Various studies have reported nitrification depletion or loss due to
seasonal temperature variations especially during winter (Caballero, 2011; FloresAlsina et al., 2011; Yao et al., 2013). It is therefore important to understand the role
of nitrifiers’ diversity and abundance in such functional fluctuations. Majority of the
studies however, have been carried out in regions with extremely low winter average
temperatures (temperate regions) contrary to the sub-tropical temperature regime
experienced in some parts of the Southern hemisphere.

Seasonal fluctuations and failures in nutrients removal due to the operational and
environmental changes have been widely reported in engineered wastewater treatment
systems (Wang et al., 2012). Among these, seasonal temperature variation has been
implicated as a major cause of breakdown in ammonia removal efficiency and
nitrification (Vieno et al., 2005; Wan et al., 2011) and with climate change
experienced globally these impact could be further magnified. Majority of the studies
have been conducted over short period of time. What we knew about the organisms
involved in nitrification is changing with some novel detection tools (Sorokin et al.,
2012; Stahl and de la Torre, 2012). There have been reports by different authors
(Limpiyakorn et al., 2011; Mussmann et al., 2011; Zhang et al., 2011b) on the probable
involvement of AOA in wastewater nitrification which indicate our inconclusive
knowledge of wastewater microbiology. However, there is still need to establish if
AOA are ubiquitous in all engineered systems in order to establish a holistic
knowledge of nitrogen biotransformation and AOA contribution in wastewater
treatment.

Understanding the microbial community structure of activated sludge has never been
an easy task. Culture-dependent methods have been relied upon solely in the past to
study microorganisms present in the natural environment including wastewater
ecosystems. Only a few bacterial species were thought to be involved in the process
based on these laboratory culture techniques, whereas in reality, a great diversity of
organisms have been involved and are nonculturable. The advent of molecular

3

techniques has brought about a better understanding of the structure and functions of
microbial communities including nitrifiers in wastewater treatment systems. In recent
past, the nitrifying community structure of activated sludge systems have been
investigated

using

different

techniques

including;

quinone

profiling,

(a

chemotaxonomic method) (Li et al., 2006), restriction fragment length polymorphism
(RFLP) (Gao and Tao, 2012), fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH), denaturing
gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) (Yu et al., 2011), clone library (Yao et al., 2013),
terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP) (Whang et al., 2012),
quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) (Cho et al., 2014). However, these techniques have
well documented limitations that often reduce their ability to unravel the complete
microbial community structure of the activated sludge (Awolusi et al., 2015). Nextgeneration sequencing which has the capacity of performing about several hundreds
of thousands of reactions simultaneously is gaining ground in studies involving
understanding the microbial community structure of wastewater treatment systems
(Liu et al., 2012; Ye and Zhang, 2013). It has the advantage of revealing the microbial
diversity with more accuracy and details.

South Africa is a sub-tropic region with warm temperate weather conditions.
Wastewater treatment plants in the KwaZulu-Natal have a history of nitrification
failure especially during the winter. This study therefore, investigated the nitrification
efficiency and nitrifying community in one of the full-scale municipal wastewater
treatment plants situated midlands of KwaZulu-Natal province, over two seasons
(summer and winter). The plant’s nitrification efficiency was investigated in
correlation to diversity and abundance of the different nitrifying populations. A
combination of FISH, PCR-clone library, quantitative polymerase chain reaction
(qPCR) and next generation sequencing (pyrosequencing and Illumina) was employed
in understanding the microbial community structure of the plant. The effect of
operating parameters and environmental conditions on nitrification and nitrifiers was
also investigated using an adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS), Pearson’s
correlation coefficient and quadratic models. To the best of our knowledge this is the
first time ANFIS, rather than the typical simple correlation approach would be used

4

for investigating nitrification. The amoA-locus-targeted pyrosequencing was also
employed to study AOB diversity for the first time.

CHAPTER TWO: LITERATURE REVIEW

2.1

NITRIFICATION

Nitrification involves the biological conversion of ammonia/ammonium to nitrite by
ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) and ammonia-oxidizing archaea followed by the
conversion of nitrite to nitrate by nitrite-oxidizing bacteria (NOB) (Bae et al., 2013;
Mukherjee, 2013). In a wastewater treatment process, most of the organic nitrogen
contained in raw sewage in the form of urea and faecal material will be converted to
ammonia by hydrolysis through anaerobic processes while travelling through the
sewer pipes (Daims and Wagner, 2010). Various authors have noted that nitrification
can be carried out by organisms other than bacteria such as protozoa, algae and fungi,
however, at a very low level rate (1,000–10,000 times less than the rates associated
with bacteria) (Gerardi, 2002; Nicol and Schleper, 2006).

Nitrifying bacteria are aerobes and chemolithoautotrophs, obtaining their energy by
oxidation of either NH3 or NO2– (Daims and Wagner, 2010; Jin et al., 2010). Certain
bacteria called anammox (anaerobic ammonium oxidation) are capable of oxidizing
NH3 under anaerobic conditions. These organisms use NH4+as their energy source and
NO2–as electron acceptor with the production of hydrazine in an intermediate process
(Xiao et al., 2013). The AOB uses the enzyme ammonia monooxygenase (amoA) to
catalyse the oxidation of ammonia to hydroxylamine (NH2OH) (Bahadoorsingh,
2010), and the enzyme hydroxylamine oxidoreductase converts it to NO2– (Canfield et
al., 2010). The NOB further oxidizes NO2– to NO3– using nitrite oxidoreductase
enzyme (Bahadoorsingh, 2010) (Fig. 2.1). Although all nitrifiers are known to be slow
growers, NOB has a lower specific growth rate than the AOB (Daims and Wagner,
2010). Thus, a successful nitrification process requires a balance in the linked activity
of these two nitrifying bacterial groups involved. It has been reported that factors such
as high ammonia concentration and low dissolved oxygen (DO) level can result in the
disruption of the equilibrium between these two nitrification steps, resulting in

6

significant reduction in the activities of nitrite oxidizers which can lead to toxic nitrite
build-up and a subsequent failure of nitrification process (Mbakwe et al., 2013).
According to Graham et al. (2007), there is a delicate and vulnerable AOB–NOB
mutualism present, which makes the process prone to chaotic behaviour and
incomprehensible failure at times.

The nitrification process in wastewater is therefore limited by the AOB and NOB
population densities and their physiological activities in different types of wastewater
treatment plants (WWTP), including conventional activated sludge treatment systems
and membrane bioreactor (MBR) (Graham et al., 2007; Huang et al., 2010a; Zhang et
al., 2011b). In both cases, the nitrification efficiency seems to be controlled by the
prevalent operational and environmental conditions (Manser et al., 2005;
Bahadoorsingh, 2010). Various authors have reported 96–99 and 92–98 % ammonia–
nitrogen and chemical oxygen demand (COD) removals in treatment systems
investigated (Liang et al., 2010; Yu et al., 2010; Ozdemir et al., 2011). Specific
ammonia oxidization rate and nitrite oxidization rates were also reported to vary with
no particular pattern during wastewater treatment (Liang et al., 2010; Yu et al., 2010;
Ozdemir et al., 2011).

2.2

NITRIFYING COMMUNITY STRUCTURE

2.2.1 Ammonia oxidizing bacteria and Nitrite oxidizing bacteria
The majority of nitrifiers in wastewater remains uncultivable, and thus, only very few
strains of AOB (25 species) and NOB (8 species) have so far been identified and
classified based on conventional cultivation techniques (Egli et al., 2003; WojnowskaBaryla et al., 2010). The growth rate of autotrophic bacteria (nitrifiers) is five times
slower than that of heterotrophic bacteria in WWTPs (Ozdemir et al., 2011). Thus, the
nitrifiers form only 3 – 20 % of the total bacteria in activated sludge (Gerardi, 2002;
Xia et al., 2010b; Yu et al., 2011; Cydzik-Kwiatkowska et al., 2012), which makes the
isolation of nitrifiers difficult. However, the successful application of molecular
techniques to the complex environmental samples has helped to unravel the
complexity and diversity of these groups in nature (Gao and Tao, 2012).

The 16S rDNA sequences revealed that these two groups of nitrifying bacteria (AOB
and NOB) are phylogenetically distinct (Daims and Wagner, 2010). All ammonia
oxidizers can be classified in the β-subclass of Proteobacteria with the exception of

8

Nitrosococcus, which belongs to a distinct branch of the γ-subclass. The NOB can be
found within the α- and γ-subclasses of Proteobacteria, with the exceptions of
Nitrospira, which has its own distinct phylum (Duan et al., 2013), and Nitrospina,
which belongs to the δ-subclass of Proteobacteria (Zeng et al., 2012) (Fig. 2.2). Due
to their low specific growth rate and sensitivity to stress from environmental and
operational factors, their population and physiological activities can limit the rate of
biotransformation of nitrogen in many WWTPs. Although the dominance of
Nitrospira (K-strategist) over Nitrobacter (r–Strategist) in activated sludge has been
widely reported (Yapsakli et al., 2011; Ye et al., 2011); however, earlier observations
by Nogueira and Melo (2006), and Wagner et al. (2002) were contrary. These authors
noted that there is usually an irreversible prevalence of Nitrobacter spp. over
Nitrospira spp. in plants after spike in nitrite concentration even after subsequent
reduction in nitrite concentration. Nitrobacter spp. usually exhibit inhibitory effect on
the growth of Nitrospira once it dominates (Nogueira and Melo, 2006). Fukushima et
al. (2013) also reported that Nitrobacter spp. though a weak competitor compared to
Nitrospira under low nitrite concentration, however it can be selected over Nitrospira
spp. in plants with low inorganic carbon in addition to low nitrite concentration.

The recognized diversity of NOB has been curiously low and they have been known
to belong to two bacterial phyla. Sorokin et al. (2012) expanded our knowledge of
NOB with the discovery of Nitrolancetus hollandicus isolated from a nitrifying
reactor. This organism belongs to the popular phylum Chloroflexi not previously
known to contain any nitrifying organism. This organism is distinguished from all
other NOB being Gram positive with an unusual membrane lipids consisting 1, 2-diols.
It is thermo-tolerant over a broad range of 25-63oC. It has low affinity for nitrite (Ks
≈ 1 mM). It grows on nitrite and CO2 with ability to use formate as a source of energy
and carbon. It has the genes for CO2 fixation via Calvin cycle and nitrite
oxidoreductase similar to proteobacterial NOB.

2.2.2 Ammonia oxidizing archaea
The developments in molecular biology techniques have helped us to understand the
diversity, distribution and abundance of possible functional archaea in engineered
systems such as WWTPs (Hatzenpichler, 2012). In recent times, the contribution of
archaea to nitrification in WWTPs is being acknowledged by various researchers;

10

however, very little information is available on the physiology and activity of
ammonia-oxidizing archaea in the environment. Among the different AOA,
Candidatus Nitrosopumilus maritimus was the first member of the group to be isolated
(Stahl and de la Torre, 2012). This species is reported to have the same growth and
cell production rates as those of AOB and is capable of using ammonia as the sole
energy source for growth (You et al., 2009).

AOA can tolerate environment with oxygen concentration over the range of <3.1 µM–
0.2 mM; however, the environment with low oxygen may select them in contrast to
AOB (Limpiyakorn et al., 2011). The AOB uses the Calvin cycle to fix their carbon,
whereas the AOA rely on the 4-hydroxybutyrate pathway or citric acid cycle
(Hatzenpichler, 2012). The AOA was previously grouped under phylum
Crenarchaeota (Jin et al., 2010; Zhang et al., 2011a) but have recently been
reclassified under phylum Thaumarchaeota (Stahl and de la Torre, 2012). Ozdemir et
al. (2011) in a study on nitrification, reported the presence of a small fraction of AOA
among other nitrifiers.

An observation of interest about AOA is that they are less sensitive to plant operational
conditions (e.g. DO and ammonia loading) compared to AOB (Jin et al., 2010;
Sonthiphand and Limpiyakorn, 2010). The fact that in natural environments AOA are
associated with significant role in nitrification contrary to what is currently known
about engineered systems leaves the question of whether the optimum conditions for
their ecological functioning have been adequately understood or replicated in such
systems. If the assertion by some authors that AOA are tolerant to fluctuations in
operational conditions (Jin et al., 2010; Sonthiphand and Limpiyakorn, 2010) is valid,
then it may be desirable to harness its potential for a stable and efficient wastewater
treatment. There would be need for the development of engineered systems that can
adequately replicate the conditions which support AOA’s optimal growth as obtained
in the natural environment. The role and efficiency of AOA in nitrification remains
unclear, since their isolation and cultivation is still largely unsuccessful. The archaeal

11

membrane lipids (isoprenoid glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraethers) have been suggested
as a bio-indicator for investigating the ecophysiology of AOA in wastewater treatment
bioreactors. These lipids have been observed to correlate with archaeal amoA gene
copies (You et al., 2009). Recently, AOA that were deficient in both carbon fixation
and NH3 oxidation abilities despite possessing amoA gene were reported (Mussmann
et al., 2011; Stahl and de la Torre, 2012). This indicates that AOA importance in
nitrification cannot be determined based on mere presence or abundance of arch-amoA
gene. Various authors observed that the AOA are able to utilize amino acids as a
carbon source akin to heterotrophs (You et al., 2009; Bouskill et al., 2011). Recently,
studies based on radiocarbon and genomic analyses suggest that the AOA either
include both heterotrophs and autotrophs, or they are single population of mixotrophs
(Bouskill et al., 2011).

2.3

FACTORS AFFECTING NITRIFIERS AND NITRIFICATION

Nitrification, like any other process that hinges on microbial physiology, is subject to
failure whenever there is a shift in operational conditions or in the presence of
inhibitory substances (Ducey et al., 2010). Thus, efficient nitrification in wastewater
treatment plants depends on a combination of environmental and operational
parameters which include pH, temperature (Gerardi, 2002; Kim et al., 2011), DO,
sludge retention time (SRT), hydraulic retention time (HRT), substrate concentration
(Bae et al., 2002; Liu et al., 2010a) and presence of inhibitory or toxic substances
(Cecen et al., 2010).

2.3.1

Environmental factors

2.3.1.1 pH and alkalinity
Traditionally, efficient nitrification has been reported at a pH ranging from 7.5 to 8.5
(Sajuni et al., 2010; Fulweiler et al., 2011). A higher pH value of 8–9 was reported to
favour elevated nitrite accumulation, thereby affecting the optimal nitrification process

12

(Bae et al., 2002). A study conducted by Bae et al. (2002) on activated sludge plants
reported an increase in the specific ammonium oxidizing rate (SAOR) when the pH
increased from 7 to 8; however, the rate dropped as the pH reached 9 and yielded the
lowest activity at pH 10 (Bae et al., 2002). In the same experiment, the specific nitrite
oxidizing rate (SNOR), on the other hand, correlated with an increase in pH from 7 to
9, but was decreased at pH 10. Similarly, He et al. (2009) in their study on nitrification,
noted that pH plays a major role in NH3 and total nitrogen (TN) removal in reactor.
When the influent pH was acidic (approximately 4.8), the NH3 removal rate was 56
%, whereas that of TN was 45 %. An increased removal of NH3 up to 99 % was
observed, while that of TN rose to 91 % when the pH was neutral (7.2), and a decrease
to 75 % (NH3) and 60 % (TN) was noted when the pH increased to about 9.7. These
findings by He et al. (2009) also indicate that efficient nitrification falls within pH
range of 7.5–8.5.

2.3.1.2 Temperature
Temperature typically has a significant effect on nitrifiers and their nitrification
efficiency (Ducey et al., 2010). According to earlier studies, the optimal temperature
range for nitrifiers was observed to be between 15 and 30 oC (Chandra and Sathasivan,
2011). Colliver and Stephenson (2000) reported that most nitrifiers will grow
optimally in a temperature range of 25–30oC. A study conducted by Huang et al.
(2010b) showed that the optimal temperature regime that supported Nitrobacter
growth was between 24 and 25 oC, whereas higher range of 29–30 oC favoured
Nitrospira. The activity of the AOB is generally faster than that of NOB because of
their different activation energy, which is between 72 and 60 kJ mol-1 for AOB,
whereas it is from 43 to 47 kJ mol-1 for NOB (Hulle, 2005). In a reactor treating
synthetic wastewater, Kim et al. (2008) found that when the temperature increased
from 20 to 30 oC, oxidation of ammonia proceeded from 0.253 to 1.33 g N/g VSS d
(5.3-fold increase) whereas nitrite oxidation was just by a multiple of 2.6 times (0.45–
1.18 g N/g VSS d), thereby indicating a high correlation of temperature with ammonia

13

oxidation. These findings therefore indicate that the influence of environmental
conditions on different nitrifying populations (AOB and NOB) varies.

Recent reports on activity of nitrifiers at very low temperature and DO level indicate
that nitrifiers are capable of adapting to extreme conditions such as low temperature.
Zhang et al. (2011a) observed that Nitrosospira spp. thrives at lower temperatures (4–
10 oC) compared to other nitrosifyer bacteria. Ducey et al. (2010) reported a high
nitrification rate of 11.2 mg N/g MLVSS/h at low temperatures (5 oC) by an
acclimatized nitrifying community, which is far above the optimum 1.71–2.0 mg NO3N/gVSS-h reported by Fan et al. (2000) and Kornboonraksa et al. (2009). These
observations show that nitrifiers are capable of adaptation in response to
environmental and operational conditions; however, a sudden shift in environmental
factors would certainly affect the nitrifiers’ activity. Earlier research efforts also
documented the effect of temperature on the nitrifying populations’ diversity.
Caballero (2011) observed in an activated sludge a higher diversity of AOB during
winter compared to summer. Wang (2013) reported significant seasonal changes in
AOB community structures and abundances in a wetland. He noted AOB community
structures were significantly different between winter and summer with winter having
a higher diversity (Wang, 2013). Similarly Miller (2011), observed a higher diversity
of AOB in a pond during winter whereas the AOB amoA gene copy number was higher
during summer.

2.3.2

Plant Operational conditions

2.3.2.1 Dissolved oxygen
A DO concentration of between 3 and 4 mg O2 L-1 has been described as optimum for
AOB and NOB growth (Hulle, 2005). However, Sarioglua et al. (2009) observed a
higher nitrogen removal of about 85–95 % in WWTP treating domestic wastewater
when the DO level was maintained at low level (1.5 mg O2 L-1). Niche-specific
adaptation to DO concentration has been observed within the NOB, with Nitrospira

14

demonstrating a negative correlation to DO concentrations (r = -0.46, P<0.01),
whereas Nitrobacter exhibited a positive correlation (r = 0.38, P<0.01)

(Huang et

al., 2010a). Nitrobacter population was also found to increase in winter (low
temperatures) and high DO levels (Huang et al., 2010b). This shows that nitrifiers can
be highly specialized; exhibiting niche-specific adaptation in response to
environmental and operational conditions. The microbial ecology of nitrifiers reveals
that Nitrospira thrives optimally in an environment with a combination of low nitrite
and oxygen levels, whereas Nitrobacter requires an environment with elevated levels
of nitrite and oxygen. This makes them k- and r-strategists, respectively, based on r–k
selection theory (Bahadoorsingh, 2010). Studies on the relationship between NOB
(Nitrospira

and

Nitrobacter)

populations

and

their

sensitivity

to

environmental/operating factors that favours good nitrification (under high DO and
limited NH3 conditions) are necessary to understand their effect on plant performance
(Huang et al., 2010b). Liu (2012) noted that NOB exhibited a significant O2 affinity
under prolonged low DO concentrations (0.16–0.37 mg/l) which in turn made them a
better competitor for O2 as their abundance increased comparably to AOB. According
to Liu and Wang (2013), under extended period of low dissolved oxygen
concentrations (≤ 0.5 mg/L) the endogenous decay of both ammonia/nitrite oxidizing
bacteria was retarded. This resulted in increased biomass density which nullified some
low DO impact on nitrification. He also reported near complete nitrification with 0.16–
0.37 mg/l DO range. Under extended low DO period NOB demonstrated significant
increase in O2 affinity which in turn made them a better O2 competitor.

2.3.2.2 Sludge retention time (SRT) and Hydraulic retention time (HRT)
It has been reported that longer SRT could impact the biological activities negatively,
including nitrification rate (Yu et al., 2010). A study conducted by Yu et al. (2010),
observed a negative correlation between SRT and the nitrifier activities, i.e. for both
specific ammonia oxidizing rate (SAOR) and specific nitrate formation rate (SNFR).
The reactor operated at a shorter SRT of 30 days showed a higher SAOR and SNFR
(0.22 kg NH4+-N/kg MLSS/day and 0.13 kg NO3-N/kg MLSS/day, respectively),

15

compared to the system operated for a longer SRT of 90 days (0.12–0.14 kg NH4+N/kg MLSS/day and 0.068–0.042 kg NO3-N/kg MLSS/day, SAOR and SNFR,
respectively). This reflects earlier reports which also indicated a negative correlation
of SRT to SAOR/SNFR in wastewater treatment (Li et al., 2006). Similarly, Huang et
al. (2001) reported that SRT has no significant influence on the biological activity
when the reactor was operated at SRT of less than 40 days. Cicek et al. (2001) reported
that when a pilot-scale bioreactor was operated at an increased SRT up till 30 days,
there was no significant effect on nitrification. The impact of hydraulic retention time
(HRT) on nitrification efficiency of wastewater treatment systems has also been
reported. Li et al. (2013) observed that a decrease in HRT from 30 to 5 h resulted in
an increase in specific ammonium-oxidizing and nitrate-forming rates. Additionally,
the study indicated that the decrease in HRT led to a reduction of AOB population
density, whereas the NOB, especially the fast growing Nitrobacter spp., increased
significantly.

2.3.2.3 Substrate concentration and Food to microorganism (F/M) ratio
Research findings have shown that nitrifiers get inhibited by free ammonia and
unionized nitrous acid (Gil and Choi, 2001; WEF, 2011; Mousavi et al., 2014).
Increased accumulation of NH3 in bio-treatment systems occurs whenever toxicant or
any inhibitory factor disrupts the nitrifiers’ functional ability. This increased NH3-N
level often gets to inhibitive level, which can result in loss of nitrification that can last
for several days to months. Concentration of NH3-N above a threshold of 200 mg/L
has been reported to inhibit nitrification efficiency (Mordorski, 1987; Kim and Kim,
2003). Optimizing the carbon: nitrogen (C: N) ratio is also essential for efficient
nitrogen removal in waste treatment systems. A low C: N ratio favours nitrification,
whereas a higher ratio supports the heterotrophs (Fu et al., 2010). In a study of
membrane-aerated biofilm reactor, nitrification efficiency of 93 % was achieved at C:
N ratio 5; however, at C: N ratio of 6, increased heterotrophic bacteria growth was
observed with resultant inhibition of nitrifiers (Liu et al., 2010b). According to Fu et

16

al. (2010) also, it was observed that AOB and NOB showed negative correlation with
C: N ratio.

The available carbon substrate for the unit mass of microorganism (known as F/M
ratio) can impact nitrification. According to Wu et al. (2014), F/M ratio between 0.2
and 0.4 proved to be optimum for nitrification, whilst the inhibitory effect of higher
F/M ratio on the nitrifiers noted.

2.3.2.4 Inhibitory substances
When toxic substances inhibit the nitrifier population, their cell growth and the
ammonia oxidation are affected. Strong toxicity will cause nitrification to be impaired
due to the disappearance of the nitrifiers (Kim and Kim, 2003). According to Caballero
(2011) there are many compounds that can exert inhibitory effect on nitrification which
include; metals, amines, proteins, tannins, phenols, alcohols, carbamates, benzene and
un-ionized ammonia at certain concentrations. Various authors have reported that
metal toxicants inhibits AOB populations and ammonium oxidation whereas it has
little or no effect on NOB and nitrite oxidation (Hu et al., 2002; Kelly et al., 2004 ;
Hawkins et al., 2008; Zhang et al., 2014). In activated sludge treating wastewater
containing Cr(VI), the AOB were found to be more sensitive than NOB to Cr(VI).
However, AOB recovery was rapid both in activity and quantity compared to NOB. In
another study involving cyanide toxicity, Kim and Kim (2003) observed that the free
cyanide has high toxicity on nitrifiers whereas complex cyanide has comparably low
toxicity effect.

2.3.2.4 Predators
Predators grazing can strongly impaired nitrification in wastewater treatment
processes since the plant’s nitrification efficiency is determined by the nitrifying
bacteria abundance in the system and their specific activity. Lee and Welander (1994)

17

noted significant correlation between predators (protozoa and metazoan) abundance
and nitrification efficiency of a nitrifying plant in their study. They also report that
vigorous grazing of these predators on the bacterial population can hamper biotransformations that are critical for process performance. According to different
studies (Carvalho et al., 2006; Shi et al., 2010; Filali et al., 2012), due to nutrient
availability, AOB are usually found at surface of the flocs and granules in activated
sludge whereas the NOB are located deeper. This can give rise to a lowering of AOB
population abundance which is important for the first rate limiting process of
nitrification.

2.4

ASSESSING NITRIFIERS DIVERSITY AND ABUNDANCE

Only a few bacterial species, were thought to be involved in the process, based on the
laboratory culture techniques, whereas in reality, a great diversity of the organisms
involved are nonculturable. The advent of molecular techniques has brought about a
better understanding of the structure and functions of microbial communities including
nitrifiers in wastewater treatment systems. These, however, still have limitations when
applied in full-scale WWTPs. Summary of these techniques used for detecting
nitrifiers from wastewater ecosystem is presented in Tables 2.1 and 2.2. As shown in
the Tables (2.1 and 2.2), FISH and PCR-DGGE has been extensively used for
nitrifiers’ biodiversity, whilst qPCR and FISH among the most widely used techniques
for their quantification. Some advantages and disadvantages of these commonly used
techniques are highlighted below.

2.4.1

Most probable number (MPN)

The MPN involves samples being incubated in a mineral medium selective for
nitrifiers. This method usually involves bias because the synthetic medium and
laboratory conditions cannot truly reproduce the complex ecological interactions
which apply in the activated sludge environment (Hirooka et al., 2009; Xia et al.,
2010a; Ayanda and Akinsoji, 2011). The cells are sometimes bound within the

18

complex matrix called floc, and some microbes interdepend on others for their
metabolic activities, which can only be achieved in a complex ecosystem such as the
activated sludge system (Ducey et al., 2010). In effect negligible diversity and amount
of the nitrifiers are enumerated using the MPN (Xia et al., 2010a; Ayanda and
Akinsoji, 2011). Li et al. (2006) investigated nitrifiers’ population dynamics using
MPN and FISH, and they observed that FISH correlated more with the specific
nitrification rate analysis than the MPN.

2.4.2

Quinone profiling

Quinone profiling, a chemotaxonomic method, is used for microbial community
structure analysis from environmental samples (Kurisu et al., 2002). This technique is
based on the presence of specific respiratory quinone as an indicator of a particular
bacterial population. However, since some bacterial groups that are phyletically
different share similar quinone groups, this technique is inadequate for analysis beyond
the phylum level (Kurisu et al., 2002). In a study by Li et al. (2006), ubiquinones
belonging to UQ-8 (β-Proteobacteria), UQ-9 (α-Proteobacteria) and UQ-10 (γProteobacteria) were recovered. However, the authors noted the difficulty in
reconciling the NOB with the quinone profiles. The entire analysis based on the
quinone profiling is characterized by assumptions and would require more specific
techniques to complement it. Thus, the species specificity was a limiting factor for this
technique when applying to complex environmental samples.

2.4.3

Fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH)

Fluorescent in situ hybridization, a widely used molecular method, involves the
binding of fluorescent oligonucleotide probes to ribosomal ribonucleic acid (rRNA)
(Fig. 2.3) (Nielsen, 2009; Junier et al., 2010; Xia et al., 2010b; Yu et al., 2011). This
method can be employed for both identification and quantification of specific bacterial
groups directly from the environment even up to the species level (Li et al., 2006).
However, the major limitations of this technique include the lack of availability of

19

probes, inefficient cell permeability, inadequate or difference in ribosome content
which can lead to low signal intensity, loop and hairpin formation of rRNA structure,
as well as rRNA-protein interactions which hinders hybridization, auto-fluorescence
and non-specific bindings (Nielsen, 2009; Ge et al., 2015).

Unlike the fast-growing microorganisms, the cellular rRNA content of anammox and
β-Proteobacterial ammonia oxidizers do not really reflect the physiological activity of
these organisms, especially during starvation and inhibition periods (Schmid et al.,
2005). Thus, correlation of the nitrifier population to its physiological activity can be
biased (Schmid et al., 2005). Witzig et al. (2002) observed that due to the low foodto-microorganisms conditions in membrane bioreactor with resultant low rRNA
molecules for the organisms, less than half of the population were detectable by FISH
whereas 80 % in activated sludge. However, few researchers have reported a direct
correlation between nitrifier population and specific ammonium and nitrite oxidation
rate using FISH probes (Yu et al., 2011). Yu et al. (2011) in a study using FISH
observed a direct correlation between the nitrifier population and the specific
ammonium and nitrite utilization rate. In spite of all the above-mentioned limitations,
FISH is still considered important as it provides information about the presence,
relative abundance, morphology and spatial distribution of microorganisms in its
natural habitat. Due to these disadvantages, researchers have come up with new ideas
for its improvement, viz catalysed reporter deposition–FISH, microautoradiography
combined with FISH, FISH–confocal scanning laser microscope, and combinatorial
labelling and spectral imaging–FISH (Egli et al., 2003; Daims et al., 2006; Valm et
al., 2012).

2.4.4

Microarray

Some other less frequently applied techniques for wastewater samples include
microarray and most probable number (MPN). Microarray is a multiplex technique
that harnesses the characteristics of DNA or RNA to bind to their complementary
sequences (Gilbride et al., 2006). Siripong et al. (2006) in a study on WWTPs noted
that the microarray technique was able to confirm the presence of nitrifiers; however,
due to insufficient fluorescence intensity, it failed to differentiate adequately between
matched and mismatched sequence. This indicates a significant shortcoming of this
technique. Kelly et al. (2005) investigated nitrifiers in samples from a wastewater
treatment facility and observed that the microarray technique could detect nitrifiers
directly without any need for complementary PCR amplification. However, they
observed that other methods, especially T-RFLP, were sensitive enough to confirm the
presence of more diversity of nitrifiers (Nitrospira sp. and Nitrobacter sp.) apart from
only Nitrosomonas sp. that microarray could detect (Kelly et al., 2005).

2.4.5

Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) – based techniques

Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is a fundamental, routinely used non-culture based
technique of analysing activated sludge community structure and function. The 16S
rRNA gene is usually targeted when determining the overall microbial diversity in
activated sludge (Fukushima, 2010), whilst genes such as polyphosphate kinase (ppk);
nitrite reductase (nirK and nirS); ammonia monooxygenase (amoA) and nitrate
reductase (narG) among others target functional level (Fukushima, 2010; Kim et al.,
2011). The bacterial 16S rRNA molecule is about 1.5 kb size. When partially or wholly
sequenced, it has sufficient conserved and variable nucleotide regions with reliable
phylogenetic information (Amann et al., 1995; Clarridge, 2004; Ramdhani, 2012).
Hence, the 16S rRNA targeted primers are usually employed to obtain amplicons from
genomic DNA extracted from activated sludge. Some of the widely used PCR-based
techniques are discussed below.

25

2.4.5.1 Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE)
Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis, a PCR-based method, is a common method
of choice by researchers and is based on generating a genetic profile or ‘‘fingerprint’’
of the microbial community of complex environmental samples (Li et al., 2006; You
et al., 2009). The species richness of the microbial community being examined is
revealed by the different base pair sequences in the amplicons (Gao and Tao, 2012).
This method has been employed extensively by researchers to evaluate the microbial
community composition of different wastewater treatment samples (Boon et al., 2002;
Xia et al., 2010b; Zhang et al., 2010) or ‘‘shifts’’ in microbial community composition
over time (Zhang et al., 2009a; Wan et al., 2011; Yu et al., 2011). Yu et al. (2011)
using a combination of PCR-DGGE and clone library analysis established
Nitrosomonas spp. as the dominant AOB. This technique has also been used
successfully by researchers to study the shift in the dominance of different species of
nitrifiers (Yu et al., 2011).

The sensitivity of this method is high, and its main advantage is that the individual
DNA bands, or fragments from the gel can be excised and phylogenetically analysed.
However, since the DGGE analysis can only be performed for shorter PCR amplicons
(≤500 bp), the sequences of the bands obtained from a gel correspond to only short
fragments of DNA (200–500 bp), and thus, the phylogenetic relations are less
constantly established using DGGE bands (Sanz and Kochling, 2007; Gao and Tao,
2012). Analysis from DGGE technique can also be influenced adversely by the
following limitations: the difficulty of DNA extraction and PCR amplification,
depending on the nature of the samples, the variations in DNA copy number after PCR,
depending on the abundance of the specific microorganisms and the intensity of the
band obtained on a DGGE gel (Sanz and Kochling, 2007; Gao and Tao, 2012). The
nonspecific amplification of the PCR primers and the presence of duplex molecules of
DNA can also introduce error into the results obtained by this method (Guler, 2006;
Li et al., 2006).

26

2.4.5.2 Terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP)
Terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP) is one of the techniques
which are being used by the researchers to monitor the microbial shift based on the
restriction banding pattern. The technique involves cleavage of terminally labelled
PCR-amplified gene by the restriction enzymes (Sanz and Kochling, 2007; Gao and
Tao, 2012). The technique can be employed to investigate the shift in both the spatial
and temporal microbial community composition from a given natural or engineered
ecosystem (Yang et al., 2011). It is a highly sensitive technique and can be used for
semi-quantitative analysis of microbial populations in a particular microbial ecological
system as an alternative to PCR-DGGE (Liu et al., 2010b). The fingerprints from TRFLP are usually inadequate for identification of individual taxonomic units (Yang et
al., 2011). Nonetheless, it is possible to sequence and identify the dominant organisms
via comparison of the fragments generated with a sequence from a public database or
a related clone library (Yang et al., 2011). However, like any other PCR-based
techniques, the biases related to DNA isolation steps and amplification also can affect
the accuracy of this method (Sanz and Kochling, 2007). Liang et al. (2010) used the
T-RFLP technique successfully to investigate the difference in nitrifier population
from two different reactors.

2.4.6

Quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR)

The quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) is the most commonly used and accepted
technique in the recent years to quantify microbes from natural and engineered
environments. This technique can be used to quantify the particular gene copies of
target organisms from a complex environment using species-specific primers. It is an
efficient and rapid technique regarded as more sensitive than FISH (Haarman and
Knol, 2005; Fukushima, 2010). However, according to Zhang et al. (2009a), the
application of either AOB 16S rDNA or the functional gene amoA for the analysis
usually has their different shortcomings of false positives and false negatives,
respectively. A combination of the two assays is therefore usually a way of overcoming
and compensating for the disadvantages when applied to AOB detection and

27

quantification. Using qPCR, Ozdemir et al. (2011) investigated nitrifiers and found
that the NOB (Nitrospira sp.) population was 5–10 times higher than that of AOB in
the WWTP. Kim et al. (2011) and Cho et al. (2014) in different studies investigated
nitrifying communities of activated sludge and noted that Nitrobacter spp. had higher
population densities compared to Nitrospira spp.

2.4.7

Next generation sequencing approaches

The traditional Sanger/dideoxy sequencing approach to process complex
environmental samples has shown to be grossly inadequate, due to the hundreds or
thousands of important sequences that go unnoticed when employing this method
(Shokralla et al., 2012). Due to thousands of potential DNA templates usually present
in wastewater samples, there is a strong need for a technique that is capable of
simultaneous detection of diverse microbial communities in different DNA templates
(Morozova and Marra, 2008; Shokralla et al., 2012). The Sanger or dideoxy
sequencing method, though useful in its own right, is limited in the quantity of targets
that can be sampled because of the read length limitations, purity requirements and
expense involved (Mardis, 2008). Contrarily, the Next generation sequencing (NGS)
approach offers a speedy, relatively inexpensive alternative with a vastly improved
amount of data production. This allows for the investigation of microbial ecology on
a larger scale and with more detail than was possible with previously used sequencing
technology (Ju and Zhang, 2015a).

Next generation sequencing offers the advantage of direct sequencing from
environmental samples without a prior cloning step in a bacterial host as in the
traditional Sanger approach. Undoubtedly, NGS has revolutionized environmental
metagenomic research, with stiff competition between manufacturers for ever
improving platforms and technologies allowing for a variety of NGS options at an ever
decreasing cost. The 454/Roche FLX system and Illumina/Solexa Genome Analyzer
NGS platforms have been widely used in deciphering the community structure of

28

activated sludge (Ju et al., 2014; Wang et al., 2014; Yang et al., 2014; Ju and Zhang,
2015a; Keshri et al., 2015).

2.4.7.1 The 454/Roche FLX system
This employs an approach termed as pyrosequencing and it is one of the most widely
used NGS for wastewater study. Pyrosequencing is a real-time DNA sequencing
technique that monitors DNA synthesis through a series of linked enzymatic processes
(Fig. 2.4) (Ronaghi, 2001; Shokralla et al., 2012). Unlike other alternatives, it does not
require cloning, gel electrophoresis, size separation, labelled oligonucleotides or
labelled primers (Ju and Zhang, 2015a). The technique can be employed for detection,
identifying and typing bacteria (Choi and Liu, 2014; Sekar et al., 2014).

The maiden application of pyrosequencing wastewater was to investigate the plasmid
metagenome and the antimicrobial resistance pattern of the activated sludge (Hu et al.,
2012). Ye et al. (2011) noted that the traditional molecular techniques do not give a
complete profile of the community structure present in the wastewater; however,
pyrosequencing has the potential of a truer estimation and more detail reflection of
such communities. In a study of nitrifying communities in WWTPs, Ye et al. (2011)
identified Nitrosomonas spp., Nitrospira spp., Nitrosospira spp., Nitrosococcus spp.
and Nitrobacter spp. by using pyrosequencing technology. They noted that apart from
Nitrosomonas spp. and Nitrospira spp., other nitrifiers did not have significant
contribution in the nitrification process (Ye et al., 2011). Zhang et al. (2011a) in a
study, observed an incongruity in the results when nitrifying communities in different
wastewater bioreactors were analysed using quantitative PCR and pyrosequencing.
Majority of the nitrifiers identified with high-thoroughput pyrosequencing were
related to Nitrosomonas spp. (Zhang et al., 2011a). The abundance and diversity of
AOB and NOB were equally investigated in tannery sludge samples by Wang et al.
(2014). This technique has also been successfully applied in studying the microbial

29

community shift in different wastewater treatment systems different authors (Zhu et
al., 2013; Choi and Liu, 2014; Hai et al., 2014).

Fig. 2.4: Schematic diagram of pyrosequencing System (Gharizadeh et al., 2001)

2.4.7.2 Illumina/Solexa Genome Analyzer
It is based on "DNA clusters" or "DNA colonies", which involves the amplification of
DNA and primer that have been attached on a flow cell. Each cluster contains
approximately one million copies of the original fragment which is enough to indicate
bases incorporated at signal intensity adequate for detection during sequencing
(Mardis, 2008). The Illumina system adopts the sequencing-by-synthesis (SBS)
technology in which DNA polymerase and the four nucleotides are added at the same
time to the flow-cell channels for incorporation into the oligo-primed cluster fragments

30

(Fig. 2.5) (Mardis, 2008; Liu et al., 2012). This SBS technology uses an exclusive
reversible terminator-based method to detect single base as they are incorporated into
DNA template strands and non-incorporated nucleotides are washed away. The
fluorescently labelled nucleotides images are captured by the camera. The fluorescent
dye cum terminal 3' blocker is chemically removed for the next cycle of incorporation
to begin (Quail et al., 2012). Unlike pyrosequencing, the DNA chains are elongated
one nucleotide at a time and image capturing can be done at a delayed time, giving
room for very large arrays of DNA colonies to be captured by successive images taken
from a single camera (Parmar et al., 2014). Illumina platform is more effective at
sequencing homopolymeric regions than pyrosequencing, however, it yields shorter
sequence reads and the accuracy is still comparable to or superior to that of
pyrosequencing (Varshney et al., 2009; Ju and Zhang, 2015a). Ju et al. (2014)
employed Illumina in investigating the seasonal dynamics of activated sludge over a
period of 4 years. A combination of Illumina and pyrosequencing have been used by
Sorokin et al. (2012) for genomic study of NOB and an entirely novel nitrifier named
Nitrolancetus hollandicus.

31

Fig. 2.5: Schematic diagram of Illumina sample preparation and sequencing (Kircher
et al., 2011)

According to Xia et al. (2010a), knowledge of microbial community structure of
wastewater treatment bioreactors is still insufficient, the emergence of molecular
techniques notwithstanding. Hai et al. (2014) noted that there is still a lack of
knowledge of temporal dynamics of microbial community of activated sludge. In this
study, a combination of Pyrosequencing and Illumina sequencing techniques were
employed to investigate the total bacterial and AOB communities involved in the full
scale municipal nitrifying plant over two different seasons. The wastewater
characteristics and operational parameters were also monitored.

2.5

STATISTICAL ANALYSIS AND MODELLING IN WASTEWATER

TREATMENT

Statistical measures such as correlation, covariance and simple regression have been
used in capturing how two data series move together or relate over time (Damodaran,
2011). Many studies have applied simple correlation or cross-correlational approaches
in capturing the relationships or interdependence between the various operational
parameters and plant efficiencies in WWTPs (Kornboonraksa and Lee, 2009; Huang
et al., 2010a; Dong and Reddy, 2012; Wang et al., 2014). However, due to
simultaneous dependence on several factors, relationship between microbial groups in
WWTPs is usually nonlinear (Klemetti, 2010). Hence, modelling the existing complex
relationships in the full-scale WWTPs needs advanced nonlinear modelling tool (Kim
et al., 2011). A robust, nonlinear system known as artificial intelligence (AI) can depict
the existing interactions between WWTP operational parameters as well as their
correlation with the simulation output (Lu et al., 2012; Alambeigi et al., 2015). AI
integrates artificial neural network (ANN), fuzzy inference system (FIS), and adaptive
neuro fuzzy interference system (ANFIS). ANN is capable of modelling nonlinear
systems effectively and have been used widely in engineering (Lu et al., 2012;
Alambeigi et al., 2015; Nasr et al., 2015a). FIS allows a logical data-driven modelling
approach and has the ability to establish qualitative interdependency among variables
(Pramanik and Panda, 2009; Nguyen and Sugeno, 2012). ANFIS is a neuro-fuzzy
system that has the potential to capture the benefits of both ANN and FIS in a single
framework which is capable of handling complex and nonlinear relationships among
several parameters (Azar, 2010; Azar, 2011; Nasr et al., 2015a).

DOMINANT NITRIFERS IN ACTIVATED SLUDGE SYSTEM
USING CONVENTIONAL MOLECULAR METHODS

3.1

INTRODUCTION

Optimum and efficient nitrification hinges on a better understanding of the structure
and dynamics of the nitrifying community structure within the wastewater treatment
systems (Xia et al., 2008; Hu et al., 2012). Nitrification involves two sequential steps
where ammonia (NH3) is oxidized in turn into nitrite (NO2-) and nitrate (NO3-). A
consortium of AOB and AOA are usually involved in the first rate limiting ammoniaoxidizing step in nitrification i.e. oxidation of ammonia to nitrite which is subsequently
oxidized to nitrate by the NOB (Ramond et al., 2015). Activated sludge system is
unique in terms of its microbial community structure which plays an important role in
the stability and efficiency of the plants (Eschenhagen et al., 2003; Zhang et al.,
2012b). The advent of molecular techniques have revealed that only less than 15% of
the microbial community in the activated sludge can be cultured (Wagner et al., 1993).
However, most often than not, the success of the molecular method employed depends
largely on the integrity of the genomic DNA extracted. A representative and accurate
bacterial diversity profiling requires nucleic acid extraction method without bias
(Rajendhran and Gunasekaran, 2008).

Nucleic acids extraction method involves direct or indirect lysis procedures (Bourrain
et al., 1999). The direct lysis procedure involves the disruption of cells within the
environmental sample matrix and subsequent purification of the DNA, whereas
indirect method entails separating the cell from the sample matrix prior to lysis and
nucleic acid extraction (Rajendhran and Gunasekaran, 2008). However, the indirect
approach is usually not efficient as compared to the direct approach (Roh et al., 2006).
It involves an initial cation-exchange resin separation of the cell from the sample
matrix and subsequent centrifugation (Bourrain et al., 1999). Various non-culture

35

based techniques have also been employed in studying the microbial community
structure of the activated sludge. Fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH), is a quick
and widely used molecular method, which involves the binding of fluorescent
oligonucleotide probes to ribosomal ribonucleic acid (Awolusi et al., 2015). It provides
information about the presence, abundance, morphology and spatial distribution of
microorganisms in its natural habitat. Different researchers have used FISH technique
in understanding the nitrifiers present in wastewater treatment plants (Yu et al., 2010;
Yu et al., 2011; Valm et al., 2012). In this chapter, the aim was to ascertain the most
suitable DNA extraction method for the activated sludge; and characterize the
dominant nitrifers (AOA, AOB and NOB) in the activated sludge system, using
conventional molecular methods including FISH, PCR and phylogenetic analysis.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

3.2.1

Plant description

The full-scale WWTP selected for this study is situated in the midlands of KwaZuluNatal province, South Africa. The plant receives a discharge of 82880 ± 20832 m3/d
(average dry weather flow), including 90% domestic and 10% industrial wastewaters.
The plant was designed based on the criteria of a modified Johannesburg (JHB)
configuration, which offered anaerobic, anoxic, and aerobic biological processes
(Daims and Wagner, 2010). As shown in Fig. 3.1, the effluent from primary settling
tank is distributed to the pre-anoxic and anaerobic tanks. The pre-anoxic basin is
enriched with return activated sludge from the bottom of a final settler, whilst effluent
from anaerobic tank is discharged into the anoxic unit. An internal recycle is pumped
from the last part of aerobic units to the anoxic zone. The mixed liquor, containing
activated sludge, flows from the aerobic zone to a secondary settler, where it is
separated under a quiescent condition into treated wastewater and return activated
sludge. Wastewater characteristics and operational parameters for the plant are shown
in Table 3.1.

36

3.2.2

Sample collection

Composite sludge samples (from the aeration tank), influent and effluent water
samples were collected fortnightly for a period of 237 days (May - July 2012 and
November 2012 - March 2013). Sterile sampling bottles were used in collecting the
samples and all samples were maintained at 4oC while in transit to the lab.
Temperature, dissolved oxygen (DO) concentrations and pH measurements were done
using a portable YSI meter (YSI 556 Multiprobe System). The plant operational
parameters were obtained from the plant operators.

Florescent in-situ Hybridization (FISH)

FISH analysis was performed for initial, rapid screening and characterization of the
nitrifying community according to the modified protocols (Amann et al., 1995; Fuchs
et al., 2007).

3.2.3.1 Cell fixation and pre-treatment
Sludge sample (1 ml) was centrifuged, then washed with 1X PBS and the resulting
pellet was fixed in a 3:1 (v/v) mixture of paraformaldehyde solution and 1X PBS (PBS:
130 mM sodium chloride, 10mM sodium phosphate buffer [pH 7.2]). This above
mixture was incubated overnight at 4oC and afterwards span down by centrifugation
and the pellet washed with 1X PBS. The fixed pellet was resuspended in equal volumes
of fresh 1X PBS–absolute ethanol mixture; this was stored at -20oC until used for
hybridization. Before the hybridization step, the fixed samples were washed and
resuspended in 1 ml of fresh 1X PBS. The resulting mixture was pre-treated according
to the optimized wattage (8 watts) earlier reported (Ramdhani, 2012), using an
Ultrasonic Liquid Processor (Misonix XL-2000). The floc dispersion was optimized
at the optimum wattage (8 Watts) for 6, 8 and 10 min to ensure the best result. The
mixture was further diluted with 0.5 ml sterile deionized water (Amann et al., 1995;
Fuchs et al., 2007).

3.2.3.2 Oligonucleotide probe selection
The oligonucleotide probes (Table 3.2) targeting the commonly found nitrifying
groups in the activated sludge (Betaproteobacterial AOB, Genus Nitrospira and
Nitrobacter spp.) were used (Bassin et al., 2012; Li et al., 2013; Lienen et al., 2014).
The 5' end of the oligonucleotide probes used were labelled with CAL Fluor Red 590
fluorescence dye (Inqaba Biotechnical Industries (Pty), South Africa).

39

3.2.3.3 Whole cell hybridization
The Teflon-coated slides were washed in alcohol (1% HCl in 70% ethanol). Coplin jar
was filled with 100 ml of diluted poly-L-lysin (0.01%, Sigma-Aldrich, Germany) at
room temperature and the slides were allowed to stand for 5 min in coplin jar
containing poly-L-lysin. Slides were then drained and dried at 60oC for 1 hour. About
ten microliter volume of the pre-treated fix sample was spotted on the Teflon-coated
slide and dried at 46oC for about 10 min. The specimen on the slide was dehydrated
sequentially in 50, 80, and 100% ethanol for 3 min each (Amann, 1995). Fresh
hybridization buffer was prepared by mixing 5 M NaCl, 1 M Tris-HCl (pH 8),
Formamide (Table 3.2) and 10% SDS. One microliter of FISH probe and 9 µl of
hybridization buffer were added onto the spotted well. The slides were then placed into
a hybridization tube (50 ml falcon tube, protected from light) containing filter paper
soaked with hybridization buffer. This was incubated overnight at 46oC. After
hybridization, the slide was placed in hybridization tube containing pre-warmed (at
48oC) wash buffer (1 M Tris/HCl, 10 % SDS, 0.5 M EDTA and 5 M NaCl [Table 3.2]),
and was incubated in hybridization oven for 1 hour at 48oC. The slides were then
washed with sterile deionized water and air-dried. Furthermore, 8 µl volume of 4′-6diamino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) was added to the slide and left for 10 min. The slide
was washed with 1X PBS and allowed to air-dry in the dark. The slides were thereafter
mounted using anti-fading Vectashield solution (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame,
CA).

The hybridized slides were examined using a Zeiss Axio-Lab HB050/AC microscope
(Carl Zeiss, Germany) equipped with a HBO 50 W Hg vapour lamp, with appropriate
filter sets, specific for TAMRA and FAM using ×100 Plan Apochromat Objective.
Images were captured using the Zeiss AxioCam MRC camera and analysis was carried
out using Zeiss Axio vision Release 4.8 imaging software.

3.2.4

Genomic DNA extraction

Genomic DNA extraction forms a critical and important step for almost all molecular
based analysis, as the extracted DNA becomes the precursor upon which the success
of the analysis hinges. Genomic DNA was extracted from sludge samples (aerobic
samples) collected during the winter and summer seasons. To ensure the integrity of
the genomic DNA used in this study, three extraction methods (enzymatic, freeze-thaw
and sonication) based on different lysis treatment, including enzymatic and physical
techniques were optimized in this study.

41

The enzymatic method was carried out using the protocol described by Purkhold et al.
(2000). Activated sludge sample (2 ml) was centrifuged at 5000x g for 5 min and the
pellet was resuspended in 725 µl DNA extraction buffer (Tris-HCl [pH 8; 100 mM],
EDTA [pH 8; 100 mM]. Fifty microliter volume of enzyme mix A (lysozyme [0.0142
mg/ µl]; lipase [0.0223 mg/ µl]; pectinase [0.017 mg/ µl]; β-Glucuronidase [0.011 mg/
µl]) was added to the resuspended pellet above, mixed gently by inversion and then
incubated at 37°C for 30 min. Furthermore, 50 µl of enzyme mix B [Proteinase K (0.01
mg/µl); Protease (0.01 mg/µl); Pronase (0.04 mg/µl)] was added to the same tube in
step above, gently mixed by inversion and then incubated at 37°C for 30 min.
Afterwards, 75 µl volume of 20% SDS was added to the incubated mixture above and
further incubated at 65°C for 2 hrs. The resultant mixture above was incubated again
at 65°C for 20 min after 600 µl of phenol: chloroform: isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1)
mixture was added and then mixed by inversion. The tube above was then vortexed
and centrifuged at 10,000 x g for 10 min at room temperature and the aqueous phase
was transferred into a fresh Eppendorf tube.

With regards to the aqueous phase obtained, 100 μg/ ml of RNase A was added to a
final concentration of 10 μg/ml and incubated at 37°C for 30 min. The sample was
then extracted with 1 volume chlorofom: isoamyl alcohol (24:1), mixed by inversion,
and centrifuged at 10,000x g for 10 min at room temperature. The aqueous phase was
then transferred into a fresh Eppendorf tube. DNA was precipitated by adding 0.6
volume of isopropanol to the tube and incubated at room temperature for 1 hr. The
DNA was collected by centrifugation (10,000 x g at 4°C for 20 min) and the
supernatant discarded. The DNA pellet was washed with 2.5 volume cold 70% ethanol.
The tube was inverted to air-dry pellets for about 10 min and pellet was resuspended
in TE buffer. The quality and quantity of the extracted DNA was ascertained with
NanoDrop ND-1000 spectrophotometer (NanoDrop Technologies, USA). The
extracted genomic DNA was stored at –20oC until further analysis.

42

The freeze–thaw method was done according to modified Briese (2002) protocol. For
this, two millilitre volume of the sludge sample was centrifuged at 7000 rpm for 5
minutes at 4oC. The pellet was washed with 1X PBS twice. The pellet was resuspended
in 750 µl volume of the lysis buffer (plus 0.2% each of PVP and β-Mercaptoethanol)
and incubated at 65oC for two hours. The mixture was then frozen-thawed (5 minutes
in ice-ethanol slurry and 3 minutes in water-bath at 65oC) for 5 times. To this, equal
volume of Tris-saturated Phenol-Chloroform-Isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1) was added,
vortexed and centrifuged for 2 minutes at 12000 rpm (4°C). The supernatant was
transferred to a fresh tube and equal volume of Chloroform was added, vortexed and
centrifuged 2 minutes at 12000 rpm 4°C. The supernatant was transferred into a fresh
tube and 0.6 volume of Isopropyl alcohol was added. Precipitation was carried out at
–20oC for 1 hour. The DNA was pelletized at 12000 rpm (4°C) for 20 minutes. The
pellet was washed (12000 rpm 4°C) with 1 ml cold 70% ethanol and air dried for 15
minutes at room temperature. The air dried DNA was thereafter dissolved in TE buffer
and stored at -20oC until further analysis. The procedure for the second mechanical
lysis method which involved sonication was similar to the freeze-thaw method except
that the freeze thaw step in ice-ethanol slurry/hot water bath was replaced with
sonication using an Ultrasonic Liquid Processor (Misonix XL-2000). The pellet was
sonicated for 15 minutes at maximal intensity according to the optimized method by
Lemarchand et al. (2005), thereafter the DNA purification was carried out as described
above.

3.2.5

Spectrophotometric analysis

A total of six replicates were used in evaluating the quality and quantity of the different
extraction protocols with the aid of NanoDrop ND-1000 Spectrophotometer (Thermo
Scientific, USA) at 260/230 and 260/280 nm spectrophotometric absorbance ratios.
Three genomic DNA extraction protocols that were based on three different lysis
methods viz: enzymatic, freeze-thaw and sonication were optimized in this study. One
microliter volume of genomic DNA sample was used for the analysis and the resulting

43

DNA was diluted to lower concentration (1-10 ng/µl) using molecular grade water for
further analysis.

3.2.6

Polymerase chain reaction

The DNA was amplified using Veriti TM 96-well Thermal Cycler (Applied
Biosystems, USA) and the thermocycling conditions are as shown in Table 3.3. The
PCR was performed in a total reaction volume of 50 μl containing 10 ng of DNA
template. The final concentrations of the different components in the reaction mix were
200 µM of DNTPs, 1.5 mM of MgCl (Taq buffer with initial MgCl concentration of
20 mM), 2.5 U of Taq DNA polymerase (Thermo Scientific, Lithuania) and 0.5 µM of
each primer (Table 3.3). The extracted genomic DNA and PCR amplicons were
subjected to agarose gel electrophoresis with 1% (wt/vol) agarose gel. The
electrophoresis was carried out and optimized at 80 volts for 60 minutes and the gel
was visualized under UV light using Vacutec gel documentation system (Vacutec,
South Africa).

3.2.7

Cloning, sequencing and phylogenetic analysis

The PCR amplicons with the expected size were purified using QIAquick PCR
purification kit (Qiagen, USA) following the manufacturer’s instruction. The cloning
was carried out using the InsTAclone PCR Cloning Kit (Thermo Scientific).
Competent cells were prepared from Escherichia coli (DH5α). During PCR
amplification, the Taq DNA polymerase enzyme adds one 3'-adenine overhang to the
two terminals of the PCR product. This unique structure of the amplicon makes it
suitable for cloning of amplicons with 3'-adenine overhang into the vector cloning
directly. These overhangs at the insertion site also prevent the restoration of circularity
to a vector.

3.2.7.1 Ligation
The purified PCR product was ligated to pTZ57R/T vector according to the
manufacturer’s instruction (Thermo Scientific, InsTAclone PCR Cloning Kit). The
ligation mixture was prepared by adding 3 μl volume of vector pTZ57R/T, 6 μl 5X
ligation buffer, 5 μl purified amplicon or supercoiled pTZ57R DNA as control DNA ,
1 μl T4 DNA ligase and DNase/RNase free water to make up to 30 μl. The mixture
was vortexed briefly and incubated overnight at 4oC for maximum number of
transformants.

3.2.7.1 Competent cell preparation and transformation
LB broth (2 ml) was seeded with a single colony of freshly streaked E. coli DH 5α and
incubated at 37o C and 200 rpm overnight in a shaking incubator. On the day of
transformation, 1.5 ml of pre-warmed (37o C) LB broth was inoculated with 150 μl
volume of E. coli DH 5α overnight culture and incubated at 37o C for 30 minutes in a
shaker. The resulting bacterial cells were centrifuged at 10000 x g for 1 minute and
the cells were resuspended in 300 μl of T-solution and incubated on ice for 5 min. The
cells were then centrifuged for 1 minute at 10000 x g, resuspended in 120 μl of Tsolution and kept on ice for 5 minutes. In a 2 ml Eppendorf tube, 2.5 μl volume of the
prepared ligation mixture (containing the vector DNA) was incubated on ice for 2
minutes, fifty microliter volume of the prepared cells were mixed with the DNA in the
Eppendorf tube and incubated on ice for 5 minutes. This mixture was plated quickly
plated on pre-warmed LB agar containing 5-Bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl β-Dgalactopyranoside

(X-Gal)/

isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside

(IPTG)

and

incubated overnight at 37oC (Sambrook and Russell, 2001).

3.2.7.2 Recombinant clones selection
Identification of the recombinant clones was carried out using the method previously
described by Padmanabhan et al. (2011). This is based on the alpha complementation,

46

where cells containing vector with an insert may be identified using blue/white
selection. In order to carry out the blue/white screening, a vector (pTZ57R/T) having
both ampicillin resistance (ApR) gene and β-galactosidase (lacZ) enzyme which
cleaves lactose into glucose and galactose was used. Recombinant plasmid was
transformed into E. coli and white colonies that grew on LB plates containing
antibiotics (ampicillin), X-Gal, and IPTG were picked for colony PCR amplification.
The E. coli cells without the vector could not grow on the LB-ampicillin agar due to
antibiotic toxicity. The plasmid pTZ57R/T and the DNA having the gene of interest
(amplicon) were both split with the restriction enzyme. White clones were randomly
selected on LB antibiotic agar plates containing X-gal and IPTG stock solutions and
positive clones were confirmed by colony PCR using appropriate primer-sets and
resolved on agarose gel for further confirmation of plasmids containing the targeted
inserts.

3.2.7.3 Recombinant clone analysis using colony PCR
Colony PCR was carried out in order to confirm the positive transformants. The
concentration of each component of the PCR mix was according to Degrange and
Bardin (1995) protocol earlier described except for the template DNA prepared
differently. Single white colony to be verified was picked from the agar plate randomly
using sterile pipette tip and suspended into the PCR mix. Colony PCR was conducted
using the appropriate primer sets as listed in Table 3 and amplification conditions.

3.2.7.4 Sequencing and phylogenetic analysis
The purified colony PCR amplicons were submitted to commercial lab (Inqaba
Biotechnical Industries (Pty), South Africa) for sequencing and analysis. The obtained
sequences were edited using Finch TV software. Clones that were 97% similar were
assembled into single operational taxonomic unit (OUT), with their representative
nucleotide sequences used for further analysis. The sequences obtained were checked
against the National Centre for the Biotechnology Information (NCBI) GenBank

47

database using the Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) for their
phylogenetic affiliations. A combination of nucleotide sequences from this study and
those obtained from NCBI database were aligned with CLUSTALX implemented in
BioEdit (Hall, 1999). The aligned sequences were exported into MEGA6 (Tamura et
al., 2013) where matrices of evolutionary distances were computed. Phylogenetic trees
were then constructed and checked by bootstrap analysis (based on 1,000 replicates)
(Tamura et al., 2011).

3.2.8

Nucleotide sequence accession numbers

The GenBank accession numbers for the nucleotide sequences of the clones isolated
in this study are KP337415-KP337452.

RESULTS

3.3.1

Comparison of DNA extraction methods

Three different extraction methods namely; enzymatic, sonication and freeze-thaw
were compared. The result obtained from samples A, B and C comparing these three
methods are shown below (Table 3.4 and Fig. 3.2). Samples A, B and C were sludge
samples taken on different days. Using the three extraction methods, DNA was
extracted from replicates of each sample A, B and C. The integrity and shearing of
each extracted DNA was examined visibly via electrophoresis on an agarose gel (1%
[w/v]). Genomic DNA with purity within the acceptable range was successfully
extracted with the 3 methods, but with different DNA concentration yields. The
extraction method involving sonication yielded DNA with significant shearing in all
the 3 samples A, B and C (Fig. 3.2). Furthermore, variability was observed in terms of
DNA concentration obtained from the different extraction techniques, with the
enzymatic method yielding highest concentrations (Table 3.4). Variability in terms of
DNA concentration was also observed among replicates of the same sample (Table
3.4).

Detection of nitrifiers using FISH

Preliminary detection and identification of the nitrifiers was carried out using FISH
probes targeting AOB and NOB (Table 3.2).

The Betaproteobacterial AOB,

Nitrospira spp. and Nitrobacter spp. were detected all through the sampling period.
The FISH micrographs of the samples hybridized with CAL Fluor Red 590 positive
with AOB, Nitrospira spp. and Nitrobacter spp. are shown in Fig.3.3.

3.3.3

Detection of the dominant nitrifiers using PCR

Using primers set amoA1F/amoA2R with the optimized PCR conditions (Table 3.3)
resulted in specific amplicons at the expected base pair length (490 bp) (Fig 3.4). The
primer sets NSR 1113F/NSR 1264R and FGPS872/FGPS1269 targeting the Nitrospira
spp. and Nitrobacter spp. respectively were used to detect the NOB in the plant.

51

Successful amplification of Nitrospira spp. and Nitrobacter spp. were confirmed with
amplicons yielding band size of 151 bp and 497 bp respectively (Fig 3.5). For the
archaea, primer sets targeting the archaea amoA and 16S rDNA primer sets were used
according to the conditions stated in Table 3.3. There was no successful archaea
amplification during this study even after the annealing temperatures was optimized

Cloning and analysis

Successful transformation was confirmed with the growth of white and blue colonies
on IPTG/X-Gal-LB agar plates after overnight incubation (Fig. 3.6). The blue colonies
represent the cells transformed with non-recombinant plasmids, whereas the colonies
formed by recombinant cells appeared white. The PCR amplification from the
recombinant clones (white colonies on IPTG/X-Gal-LB agar plate) yielded amplicons
with expected base pair size on agarose gel after electrophoresis (Fig. 3.7 and 3.8).
These were later sent for sequencing at Inqaba Biotechnical Industries (Pty), South
Africa.

Phylogenetic analysis

The sequences obtained were analysed using the NCBI BLAST programme. The
clones were grouped into the same operational taxonomic unit (OTU) based on 97%
sequence similarity and their representative sequences were employed for further
analysis. The dominant AOB sequences during the study were related to uncultured
ammonia

bacterium,

uncultured

Nitrosomonadaceae

bacterium,

Nitrosomonas sp. and uncultured bacterium (Fig. 3.9). The comparative sequences
analysis for Nitrobacter clones revealed 95 – 97% relatedness to uncultured alpha
proteobacteria, uncultured bacterium, uncultured Nitrobacter sp., and uncultured
Bradyrhizobium sp. (Fig. 3.10). The partial sequences obtained from Nitrospira clones
revealed 98 – 100% similarity to uncultured bacterium, Candidatus Nitrospira
defluvii, uncultured Nitrospira sp. and uncultured Nitrospirae bacterium (Fig. 3.11).
The partial sequences obtained were used in constructing the phylogenetic tree and
also deposited with GenBank to obtain accession numbers (KP337415-KP337452).

DISCUSSION

The success of molecular analyses of environmental samples is largely dependent on
the purity, yield, and molecular weight of the extracted genomic DNA (Shan et al.,
2008). Isolation of high molecular weight DNA allows the characterization of large
regions of the genomes (Rajendhran and Gunasekaran, 2008). In this study, the
efficiency of the different DNA extraction methods was evaluated since cell lysis is
extremely critical. Although there are different studies that have reported optimal DNA
extraction methods from sludge, however, lysis method with the highest DNA yield
for different sludge samples varies with specific sludge sample (Bourrain et al., 1999).
Due to variation in microbial compositions and floc morphology different activated
sludge samples required specific cell lysis method adapted to them (Rajendhran and
Gunasekaran, 2008). Optimization of the DNA extraction method is necessary in order
to have efficient and representative release of nucleic acids from complex community
such as activated sludge (Bourrain et al., 1999). In this study, the enzymatic method
yielded highest nucleic acid concentration (775.20 – 802.90 ng/µl) followed by
sonication (403.90 – 521.00 ng/µl) and freeze-thaw (352.79 – 433.93 ng/µl). However,
the mechanical cell lysis involving sonication proved to be harsh, with resultant
genomic DNA having severe shearing. Sonication has been reported an effective
technique for dispersing sludge sample aggregates during DNA extraction (Picard et
al., 1992; Lemarchand et al., 2005). However, according to earlier studies, high
genomic DNA shearing could result when employing this treatment, since it is capable
of disrupting the DNA molecules (Lemarchand et al., 2005; McIlroy et al., 2009).
According to Rajendhran and Gunasekaran (2008), when comparing mechanical lysis
procedure, sonication is more vigorous than freeze-thaw method (thermal-shock)
resulting in more DNA degradation as evident in this present study (Fig. 3.2).

The physical integrity of the genomic DNA extracted is very important as excessive
shearing can inhibit the amplification of large gene regions or result in PCR artefacts
(chimeras) (McIlroy et al., 2009). There was little shearing effect observed in genomic
DNA isolated with both freeze-thaw and enzymatic methods (Fig. 3.2), which makes

59

the obtained nucleic acid useful for the downstream analysis. McIlroy et al. (2009)
noted that it was impossible to have a total cell lysis for DNA extraction from activated
sludge without unacceptable shearing of the DNA, hence, a compromise must be made
between total cell lysis and shearing. Both freeze-thaw and enzymatic methods yielded
genomic DNA with good purity that was close to 1.8 at 260/280 nm absorbance ratio
(Table 3.4). As indicated in Table 3.4, the sonication and freeze-thaw extraction
methods yielded DNA with 260/230 absorbance ratio within the range for pure DNA
(sonication: 2.11 - 2.52; Freeze-thaw: 1.95-2.20), however, it was relatively lower for
enzymatic method (1.59 - 1.74). According to the Beer-Lambert law, there is a direct
correlation between absorbance and concentration. Although the nucleic acids absorbs
at many wavelengths, however their peak absorbance of UV light occurs at 260 nm.
The 280 nm absorbance is measured because this is typically where proteins and
phenolic compounds have a strong absorbance. Many organic compounds have strong
absorbance at around 225 nm. In addition to phenol, TRIzol, and chaotropic salts, the
peptide bonds in proteins absorb light between 200 and 230 nm (UCR, 2016;
Thermoscientific, n.d.).

The A260/280 ratio is generally used to determine protein contamination of a nucleic
acid sample. The aromatic proteins have a strong UV absorbance at 280 nm. For pure
DNA, A260/280 ratio should be approximately 1.8±0.1 (Lemarchand et al., 2005;
Singka et al., 2012). A lower ratio indicates the sample is protein contaminated which
affect downstream applications involving the nucleic acid (UCR, 2016;
Thermoscientific, n.d.). The A260/230 ratio indicates the presence of organic
contaminants including phenol, TRIzol, chaotropic salts and other aromatic
compounds. The 260/230 ratio for pure DNA samples is between 2.0 and 2.2 (UCR,
2016; Thermoscientific, n.d.). However, according to earlier study by Lemarchand et
al. (2005), DNA extracted from environmental samples with OD 260/280 range
between 1.46 and 1.79 are pure enough for PCR without any inhibition. The freezethaw method gave genomic DNA of higher purity but lower DNA yield when
compared to the enzymatic method. Ferrera et al. (2010) earlier observed that phenol–
chloroform extraction after enzymatic lysis resulted in better DNA yields and

60

detectable diversity when compared to freeze-thaw method. The reduced
concentration associated with the freeze-thaw procedure when compared to enzymatic
lysis could be due to lower cell wall lysis efficiency achieved with the freeze-thaw
treatment (Lemarchand et al., 2005). Bourrain et al. (1999) also noted a lower DNA
yield resulting from freeze-thaw (thermal shock) procedure when compared to
enzymatic treatment of the sludge sample. Rajendhran and Gunasekaran (2008) noted
freeze-thaw method is usually more efficient for lysing gram-positive bacterial cells.
The quality of the extracted DNA with freeze-thaw method was sufficient for PCR
amplification of 16S rRNA and amoA gene of bacterial nitrifiers without inhibition.
Hence, freeze-thaw method was adopted throughout this study.

FISH was used as a quick screening method for identifying the nitrifiers in the samples.
Nielsen (2009) earlier reported inefficient cell permeability as one of the many limits
of the FISH technique. Ramdhani et al. (2013) reported optimum condition for
dispersal of flocs obtained from nitrifying municipal activated sludge as 8 watts for 8
min. However, in this study when sonication was carried out at 8 watts for 8 min, the
floc dispersion was not effective. Efficient floc dispersion was only recorded when
sonication time was increased from 8 min (at 8 watts) to 10 min. The result indicated
that sonication at 8 watts for 10 min was optimum for this particular sludge sample,
and it further demonstrated the need for FISH pre-treatment optimization for sludge
samples (Ramdhani et al., 2010). The presence of the Betaproteobacterial AOB,
Nitrospira spp. and Nitrobacter spp. (Fig. 3.3) were detected in abundance throughout
the sampling period in the sludge samples using the optimized protocol (Table 3.2).
This result is similar to various studies that have reported successful identification of
nitrifiers in activated sludge using Nso1225 (AOB), NIT3 (Nitrobacter spp.) and
Ntspa662 (Nitrospira spp.) FISH oligonucleotide probes (Egli et al., 2003; Li et al.,
2006; Shi et al., 2010).

The importance of molecular techniques in understanding the microbial community
structure of activated sludge has been documented by different authors (Gao and Tao,

61

2011). However, the need for complementary use of these molecular techniques in
order to obtain a better assessment of microbial diversity has been noted, since they all
have both advantages and pitfalls (Rastogi and Sani, 2011). In this study, the FISH
analysis was complemented by PCR, sequencing and phylogenetic analysis for
identification purpose. All the nitrifier primers used in this study (Table 3.3) produced
positive amplicons from the sludge samples, except the AOA that could not be
successfully amplified using primer set amoAF/Arch-amoAR. Although, some earlier
studies have reported AOA (using the same primer set) to be involved in ammonia
biotransformation in engineered systems (Ozdemir et al., 2011; Hatzenpichler, 2012),
however, this organism was not identified to be involved in nitrification all through
this study. This could suggest that AOA was not important in the nitrification process
of this plant and may not be ubiquitous in all engineered wastewater treatment systems.

The phylogenetic analysis showed that the AOB sequences in this study were related
to uncultured ammonia oxidizing bacterium, uncultured Nitrosomonadaceae
bacterium, Nitrosomonas sp. and amoA gene of the uncultured bacterium (Fig. 3.9).
This finding indicated similarity to previous report in which the dominant AOB in
eight different activated sludge systems were closely related to Nitrosomonas spp.
(Wang et al., 2010). Siripong and Rittmann (2007) likewise reported the dominance
of Nitrosomonas spp. in seven different WWTPs studied. The AOB in this study could
not be identified beyond the genus level and there was no evidence of high species
richness among them based on the results obtained (Fig. 3.9). Wang et al. (2012) also
reported, the phylogenetic analysis of cloned amoA genes that indicated all the
dominant AOB in the WWTP studied to be closely related to Nitrosomonas spp. It has
been reported that Nitrosomonas spp. has a relatively high Ks for ammonia and this
makes them frequently found in environments with moderately high ammonia
concentrations (Wang et al., 2012). An average ALR of 121 ± 22.0 - 144 ± 29.0 gNH4/m3.d recorded in this plant could be one of the reasons for Nitrosomonas spp.
dominance. Another possible reason for the low AOB diversity observed in this
present study could be as a result of the industrial component of the municipal influent
being received in this plant. Wang et al. (2010) earlier reported that WWTPs receiving

62

mixed domestic and industrial influent usually have low AOB diversity. Studies have
also shown that activated sludge systems can possibly select for preponderance of
single bacterial population or highly diverse bacterial populations can exist together
(Rowan et al., 2003; Ding et al., 2011). Ramdhani (2012) reported variations in the
abundance and nitrifying community structures of different South African’s WWTPs.
Identifying the microbes responsible for pollutants biotransformation and removal can
reveal some information about the properties of the activated sludge (CydzikKwiatkowska et al., 2012). The prevailing factors in different wastewater treatment
plants are complex and this usually results in high variability in microbial structure,
which differs from plants to plants (Ahmed et al., 2007; Calderon et al., 2012;
Fukushima et al., 2013).

The Nitrobacter clones isolated in this study showed more affiliation to uncultured
alpha proteobacterium, uncultured bacterium, uncultured Nitrobacter sp. and
uncultured Bradyrhizobium sp. (Fig 3.10) whereas the Nitrospira clones were closely
related to uncultured bacterium, Candidatus Nitrospira defluvii, uncultured Nitrospira
sp. and uncultured Nitrospirae bacterium (Fig 3.11). Nitrospira defluvii was first
isolated in pure culture from activated sludge treating municipal wastewater by Spieck
et al. (2006). Nitrobacter spp. and Nitrospira spp. have been commonly reported in
different WWTP receiving municipal influent by many authors (Ramdhani, 2012;
Ramdhani et al., 2013; Fujitani et al., 2014). Nitrobacter and Nitrospira have been
reported as the key NOB that coexist in different activated sludge systems (Kim and
Kim, 2006; Ramdhani, 2012; Hoang et al., 2014). Other AOB species (Nitrosolobus,
Nitrosovibrio, Nitrosospira and Nitrosococcus) were not identified in this plant. This
indicates that the nitrifiers’ community of the plant was not highly diverse. Various
studies have reported the existence of Nitrosomonas, Nitrosospira and Nitrosococcus
as the AOB in nitrifying wastewater treatment plants (Guler, 2006; Nielsen et al.,
2010; Duan et al., 2013).

CONCLUSIONS

 The study revealed that DNA extraction method involving freeze-thaw yielded DNA
with the best purity and minimal shearing. Sonication method resulted in significant
degradation of the DNA, hence it was not suitable for this sample.
 The phylogenetic analysis of the dominant nitrifying populations in the plant revealed
similarity in species richness over the seasons. Perhaps this is because the PCR-clone
libraries of environmental samples could be limited in resolution; hence there is need
for next generation sequencing which can give a better detail in terms of microbial
diversity in environmental samples over time and space.
 This municipal reactor has its nitrifying community made up of Nitrosomonas spp.
Nitrobacter spp. and Nitrospira spp. This indicates that the species richness among
AOB in the plant was not high. Hence, the community did not exhibit substantial
congeneric homotaxis, which can impart high functional redundancy on them.
 This study revealed that AOA was not part of the dominant nitrifiers in this plant.
Hence, it was not an important player in ammonia biotransformation in this WWTP
and may not be ubiquitous in all nitrifying WWTPs.

INTRODUCTION

Understanding the complex microbial community in WWTPs is important in
designing functionally stable and effective treatment systems. The advent of molecular
techniques has revealed the inadequacies of traditional microbiological methods of
identifying and quantifying microbes in wastewater (Xia et al., 2010a). The different
Sanger-sequencing based molecular approaches including; polymerase chain reaction
– denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (PCR-DGGE), terminal restriction fragment
length polymorphism (T-RFLP), temperature-gradient gel electrophoresis (TGGE)
and cloning have been successfully used in profiling the high microbial diversity
harboured in WWTPs (McMahon et al., 2009; Gomez-Silvan et al., 2010). Fluorescent
in situ hybridization among others have also been used in microbial diversity profiling
of engineered wastewater treatment environments with some degrees of success
(Awolusi et al., 2015). More recently, it has been shown that the traditional Sanger
sequencing is yet, grossly underestimating the communities of the complex
environmental samples due to the hundreds or thousands of important sequences that
go unnoticed when employing this method (Shokralla et al., 2012). A major
shortcoming of this technique is that it requires in vivo amplification of DNA
fragments in bacterial hosts (cloning) prior to sequencing. Cloning is labour-intensive,
tediously long and subject to bacterial host bias (Morozova and Marra, 2008).

Due to the thousands of template DNA usually present in wastewater samples there is
need for technique that is capable of simultaneous reading from different DNA
templates (Shokralla et al., 2012). The dideoxy or Sanger sequencing, due to the
expenses involved, can limit the depth of diversity that could be sampled (Mardis,
2008). Moreover, the diversity of clones being selected for subsequent dideoxy

65

sequencing is highly subjective and limited by human bias. Contrarily, the Next
generation sequencing (NGS) approach offers a speedy, and extensive data production
with the opportunity of investigating the microbial ecology on a larger scale and with
more details (Ju and Zhang, 2015a). Next generation sequencing offers the advantage
of direct sequencing from environmental samples without prior cloning into a bacterial
host before sequencing, as obtained in the traditional Sanger approach. The NGS has
revolutionized the genomic and metagenomic research with different platforms being
commercially available. In this chapter, variation in community structure of the
aerobic nitrifying activated sludge over the winter and summer was evaluated using
the combination of pyrosequencing and Illumina sequencing techniques.

Wastewater treatment plant operation

Wastewater characteristics and operational parameters for the selected plant in this
study are shown in Table 3.1.

4.2.2

DNA extraction

Genomic DNA was extracted from sludge samples (aeration basin) taken over the
winter and summer seasons using the freeze-thaw method as described in section 3.2.4.

4.2.3

Seasonal analysis of community structure in the activated sludge

4.2.3.1 Sample preparation and DNA extraction
The total bacterial community diversity was investigated using Illumina Genome
Analyser whilst the diversity of AOB group was assessed using high-throughput
pyrosequencing approach. Samples taken between the 1st and 78th day represented the
winter period (May - July 2012) whilst the samples from 79th through 237th day

66

(November 2012 - March 2013) represented summer. The extracted DNA samples for
the winter months were pooled together in equimolar quantities to make up the winter
template DNA sample, whilst the same was done for the summer months. These
resulted in two separate template DNA samples that used for the Illumina and
pyrosequencing analysis. The detail freeze-thaw DNA extraction protocol is shown in
Section 3.2.4.

4.2.3.2 Sequencing and Analysis
The pooled DNA (winter and summer samples) were subjected to high-throughput
sequencing using the Illumina MiSeq platform at Inqaba Biotechnical Industries (Pty),
South Africa, using the universal bacterial fusion primer sets targeting the
hypervariable V3-V4 region of the 16S rRNA with adapter primers attached to its 3′
end (Wang et al., 2014). The obtained reads were trimmed and filtered where only q30
(i.e. high quality) reads and a minimum length of 50 bp (after trimming) were selected
(Dogan et al., 2014). Using the genomic CLC software, the selected reads were aligned
and this was compared to known 16-18S rRNA gene tag database (E-value cut-off at
0.005) using BLASTn programme (Sekar et al., 2014). Dissimilarity cut-off of 0.03
and 0.20 was used to cluster the cleaned (selected) reads into operational taxonomic
units. Taxonomic classification into domain, phylum, order, class, families and genus
was performed using a set of confidence threshold based on OTU diversity and reads
(OTU abundance) (Keshri et al., 2015). The percentage or relative taxonomic
abundance of individual taxon within the community was computed by comparing the
number of sequences assigned to a specific taxon with the total number of sequences
obtained from the sample. The raw Illumina file (fastq) has been deposited into NCBI
sequence Read Archive.

The amoA locus of the AOB in the activated sludge was amplified using the primer
set: amoA-1F/amoA-2R. The PCR was performed in a total reaction volume of 50 μl
containing 10 ng of DNA template. The final concentrations of the different

67

components in the reaction mix (200 µM of DNTPs, 1.5 mM of MgCl [Taq buffer with
initial MgCl concentration of 20 mM], 2.5 U of Taq DNA polymerase [Thermo
Scientific, Lithuania] and 0.5 µM of each primer) were according to modified
protocols from Degrange and Bardin (1995). The PCR products were purified and endrepaired.

The amoA amplicons generated from the PCR were sent to Inqaba

Biotechnical Industries (Pty), South Africa, where the composition of the amplicon of
amoA targeted locus was then determined by pyrosequencing. The barcodes for
multiplexing were incorporated between the forward primers (amoA-1F) and the 454adpter sequence for pyrosequencing using Roche 454 FLX Titanium sequencing
platform (Roche, USA) (Schloss et al., 2009). After sequencing, the unique tags
obtained were aligned with the 16S rRNA database with the aid of the BLASTN
programme (Sekar et al., 2014). The tag redundancy was eliminated and sequences
were assigned into OTU based on similarities of greater than 90%. With the aid of
MEGA6 software, representative sequences were aligned using the ClustalW
programme. The neighbour-joining method was employed for the phylogenetic
analysis (Tamura et al., 2013). The raw pyrosequencing .sff file has been deposited
into the NCBI sequence Read Archive.

4.2.4

Short-read archive accession numbers

The raw reads for the pyrosequencing and Illumina have been deposited into NCBI
Sequence Read Archive under the accession numbers SRP053412 and SRP058452
respectively.

RESULTS

4.3.1

The total microbial community diversity as revealed by Illumina

sequencing analysis
The total bacterial community diversity in summer and winter was investigated using
Illumina (Miseq) sequencing platform. Seasonal variation was observed in the species

68

richness of the plant’s microbial community. The summer sample was higher in
diversity compared to the winter samples (Figs. 4.1 – 4.4). In total, 9 and 12, bacterial
phyla apart from the unclassified sequences were identified for the winter and summer
seasons respectively. Verrucomicrobia, Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, Chloroflexi,
Planctomycetes, Actinobacteria, Proteobacteria and Acidobacteria sequences were
common in both samples. Representatives of Spirochaetes, Fusobacteria and
Fibrobacteres were present in abundance in summer sample (Fig. 4.1). Actinobacteria
(29.4%) was the most abundant during winter, whilst majority of the sequences from
the summer sample were related to Proteobacteria (13.2%). The majority of sequences
from both seasons could not be classified even at the phylum level [50.6% (winter)
and 66.5% (summer)]. Substantial variations in proportions of the phyla (i.e.
composition) were observed over the seasons (Fig. 4.1). During winter, Proteobacteria
(9.5%) was the second predominant category followed by Planctomycetes (2.7%),
Firmicutes (2.5 %), Bacteroidetes (1.8 %), Verrucomicrobia (1.5 %), Chloroflexi (1.3
%), Acidobacteria (0.5 %) and Euryarchaeota (0.3 %). Spirochaetes, Fibrobacteres
and Fusobacteria were not identified during this season. However, in contrast, during
summer Verrucomicrobia (5.6 %) were found to be the second most dominant phyla
followed by Planctomycetes (4.4 %), Actinobacteria (3.4 %), Firmicutes and
Bacteroidetes were both fourth most dominant (2.0 %), followed by Acidobacteria
(1.0 %), Spirochaetes (0.7 %), Fibrobacteres (0.5 %) and Fusobacteria (0.2 %).

The class Actinobacteria accounted for 29.9 % during winter, whilst it was 3.4 % in
summer (Fig. 4.2). Flavobacteria, Deltaproteobacteria, Betaproteobacteria,
Alphaproteobacteria, Acidobacteria, Chloroflexi, Clostridia, Gammaproteobacteria,
Bacteroidetes, and Planctomycetacia were found during both seasons (Fig. 4.2).
Methanobacteria and Bacilli were exclusively found during winter whilst
Sphingobacteria,

Gemmatimonadetes,

Spirochaetes,

Fusobacteria,

Verrucomicrobiae, Fibrobacteres and Chlamydiae where found only during summer
(Fig. 4.12). The sequence reads were classified taxonomically which showed high
diversity at lower taxonomic levels with 20 orders and 26 families identified during
winter whilst it was 27 orders and 35 families during summer (Figs. 4.3 and 4.4). The

69

Mycobacteriaceae, Planctomycetaceae and Verrucomicrobiaceae were the most
dominant families among the sequences classified during the two seasons sampled
(winter and summer).

The rank abundance plot which is used in NGS analysis to represents the species
richness (number of species) and evenness (relative abundance of species) (Kim et al.,
2013; Keshri et al., 2015) was constructed with the abundance of the uncultured
sequences during the study (Fig 4.5a and b). During winter, the uncultured bacterium
was the most abundant followed by Methylocella silvestris, uncultured Chloroflexales,
Tetrasphaera australiensis, Mesorhizobium sp., and Hyphomicrobium sp. These
groups accounted for 92 % of the total sequences. The six most abundant groups during
summer were uncultured bacterium, uncultured Betaproteobacteria, Knoellia
subterranean, uncultured planctomycete, Afipia genosp, uncultured verrucomicrobia,
which covered 82 % of total sequences. In total, about 0.04 % of the sequences could
not be classified up to genus level during the winter whilst it was only 0.03 % during
summer. The analysis based on diversity and relative abundance of different species
indicated a strong difference among the bacterial communities at different seasons in
the plant (Fig 4.5a and b). It was observed that the plant harboured diverse microbial

73

communities over the different seasons and only a small microbial community overlap
was observed during the winter and summer. About 30 sequences were found in
common to both seasons whilst there were 33 other sequences that were found in the
winter samples which did not exist in summer and 49 others that were found only
during summer.

Ammonia oxidizing bacteria profiling based on amoA gene using high

throughput pyrosequencing
Ammonia oxidation has been identified as the rate limiting step in nitrification hence,
the diversity of the AOB in this system was examined to understand their role in
nitrification efficiency. The AOB diversity for the different seasons was revealed by
454-pyrosequencing using the amoA-1F and amoA-2R primer sets (with multiplex
barcodes inserted between the forward primers and the 454 adapter sequence). With
the aid of MEGA6 software, representative sequences were aligned using the ClustalW
programme and the neighbour-joining method was employed for the phylogenetic
analysis (Figs. 4.6 – 4.7). A total record of 212 and 1192 effective sequences were
obtained from the winter and summer samples respectively. After comparing them
with the NCBI database, substantial percentages of the read from either sample (72 %
in winter and 78 % in summer samples) returned no hits and could not be assigned to
any phylum. (Fig. 4.8).

The identified AOB populations during study include the uncultured ammonia
oxidizing bacteria, uncultured bacterium and Nitrosomonas oligotropha. Among these
identified AOB populations, the uncultured ammonia oxidizing bacteria was the most
dominant throughout the study with 97% and 95% during summer and winter seasons
respectively, whilst the uncultured bacterium was 2% and 5% during the summer and
winter respectively. The Nitrosomonas oligotropha was about 1% of the AOB
population during the summer season, however, it was not detected during the winter
(Fig. 4.8). The AOB diversity was 6 times higher during summer than winter (Fig. 4.8)
when a higher NH3 removal rate and temperature were recorded (Table 3.1). The AOB
sequences related to uncultured bacterium and uncultured AOB showed increase of
133% and 360% respectively when the season changed from winter to summer (Fig.
4.8).

DISCUSSION

The seasonal population dynamics of nitrifying and total bacterial communities of the
full-scale municipal bioreactor was investigated. The physicochemical analysis during
winter and summer revealed significant difference in operating conditions for the
investigated seasons (Table 3.1). Higher organic and ammonia loading rates, solid

78

retention time, MLSS, COD, were noticed during winter (Phase 1), whereas
temperature and influent flow rates during the phase 2 (summer) were higher for the
plant (Table 3.1). According to Cydzik-Kwiatkowska et al. (2012), identifying the
microbes responsible for pollutants biotransformation and removal reveals a lot of
information regarding the properties of the activated sludge. Previous studies by
Keshri et al. (2015) and Imarla et al. ( 2006) showed a high correlation between the
microbial community structure and physicochemical parameters as noted by previous
studies. The importance of the molecular techniques in understanding the microbial
community structure of activated sludge has been documented by different authors
(Gilbride et al., 2006; Gao and Tao, 2011; Rastogi and Sani, 2011). Generally, the
traditional molecular techniques such as ribosomal intergenic spacer analysis (RISA),
terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (t-RFLP), denaturing gradient gel
electrophoresis (DGGE), 16S rRNA clone libraries and FISH are known to be effective
for microbial community characterization, however, they are inefficient for full
spectrum or in-depth taxa detection in highly complex communities (Xia et al., 2010a;
Rastogi and Sani, 2011; Shokralla et al., 2012). On the other hand, next-generation
sequencing approach (including Illumina and pyrosequencing) provides sufficient
sequencing depth to cover the complex microbial communities (Zhang et al., 2012b;
Keshri et al., 2015).

In this study, the Illumina sequencing technique was employed in profiling the
microbial communities of the activated sludge system treating municipal wastewater
at different seasons. The community structure as revealed by Illumina indicated that
during summer, a season characterized with warmer temperature had more species
richness when compared to the winter. Researchers have shown that temperature has
an influence on microbial community compositions (Cydzik-Kwiatkowska et al.,
2012). On the contrary, earlier findings by Ju et al. (2014) indicated that there was
higher bacterial species richness in the activated sludge studied during winter as
compared to summer. However, geographical comparisons is difficult since
environmental conditions and operating parameters differ substantially across regions.
Activated sludge systems can either select for preponderance of single bacterial

79

population or highly diverse bacterial populations can exist together simultaneously
(Ramdhani, 2012). It was also observed that despite overall higher microbial diversity
obtained during summer; certain microbial populations (Tetrasphaera spp. and
Ruminococcus spp.) had higher abundance during winter when compared to summer.
This was similar to earlier finding by Ju et al. (2014) that reported higher abundance
of Tetrasphaera spp. and Ruminococcus spp. during winter compared to summer.
However in this present study, genus Bifidobacterium had a lower abundance in winter
contrary to earlier observations by Ju et al. (2014). This result indicates that knowledge
of activated sludge metagenomics is still incomplete and that individual plant may
select for their unique microbial community compositions based on the prevailing
operational conditions of the plant (Miura et al., 2007; Ramdhani, 2012; Ramdhani et
al., 2013; Ju and Zhang, 2015b). The plant had significant variation in the influent
wastewater compositions, prevailing operational and environmental parameter (Table
3.1) which correlated with variations in the microbial community structure of the
reactor. This variation in microbial diversity affects the plant’s seasonal nitrification
performance as earlier reported (Rowan et al., 2003; Miura et al., 2007). The highest
percentage ammonia removal efficiency was recorded during summer when the
greatest AOB diversity was found in the reactor (Table 3.1). It indicates that AOB
diversity could be a contributory factor to efficient ammonia removal in activated
sludge. However, the significant variation in the total bacterial community diversity of
the plant had no significant effect on the carbon removal of the plant. The average
COD removal of the plant across the two seasons investigated did not indicate
significant variation (Table 3.1).

Based on the pyrosequencing analysis, the higher AOB diversity was observed in
summer when there was a comparatively higher ammonia removal efficiency (Table
3.1). The Nitrosomonas oligotropha was only detected in the summer sample which
indicate a possible higher diversity during summer compared to the winter period (Fig
4.8). Furthermore, the AOB diversity was 6 times higher during summer than winter
when a higher NH3 removal rate and temperature were recorded. Using
pyrosequencing, Zhang et al. (2015) also observed higher AOB diversity in summer

80

compared to winter when monitoring three different WWTP. Niu et al. (2016) also
reported a significant decrease in bacterial amoA genes copy numbers during winter,
in a water purification plant. In this study, the AOB sequences related to uncultured
bacterium and uncultured AOB showed increase of 133% and 360% respectively when
the season changed from winter to summer. Nitrosomonas oligotropha-like sequence
that were detected from summer samples (1%) were absent in winter samples (Fig 4.8).
Earlier research efforts have documented similar trend in different environment.
Temperature has a major influence on AOB diversity and population structure with
lower species richness correlating to lower temperatures (Urakawa et al., 2008).
Similarly, Ju et al. (2014) observed a higher abundance of Nitrosomonas in activated
sludge during summer. Faulwetter et al. (2013) also reported seasonal impact on AOB
community structure in constructed wetland with higher diversity during summer
compared to winter. A higher diversity of amoA gene was also recorded during
summer in the tidal wetland investigated by Zheng et al. (2013).

Overall, the summer period harboured larger AOB diversity compared to winter as
revealed in this study. A significant proportion of the effective sequences (72 % in
winter and 78 % in summer sample) termed "no hits" could not be successfully
classified into any known bacterial 16S rRNA sequences since they showed no
similarity to the available sequences in NCBI database. This suggests yet unidentified
populations and vast unexploited AOB diversity. Yang et al. (2011) reported that
unassigned or unclassified bacteria usually consists higher proportion in activated
sludge compared to other environments such as soil, because activated sludge have a
more complex microbial communities. Shi et al. (2013) also reported the occurrence
of unclassified bacteria sequences in chlorination and clear water tanks. They noted
that these unclassified OTUs from the different samples were closely clustered in the
phylogenetic tree. There is need for more study in order to identify these ecologically
significant diversity of novel AOB species which makes up the complex activated
sludge communities.

CONCLUSIONS

 Pyrosequencing reveals higher diversity of AOB in the reactor during summer that was
characterized by higher temperature. Furthermore, N. oligotropha was only identified
during summer. This indicates that higher temperature elicited increased AOB
diversity.
 The AOB diversity was 6 times higher during summer than winter when a higher NH3
removal rate and temperature were recorded. The AOB sequences related to uncultured
bacterium and uncultured AOB showed increase of 133% and 360% respectively when
the season changed from winter to summer. This suggests that higher AOB diversity
resulted in increased nitrification in activated sludge.
 Despite the high variability in seasonal diversity of total bacteria in the plant, the
carbon removal efficiency of the plant was not affected as it remains stable across the
two seasons.
 Our finding suggests that vast diversity of novel, ecologically significant AOB species,
which remain unexploited still inhabit the complex activated sludge communities
 Future research should target characterization of the nitrifying populations in
wastewater as pyrosequencing revealed a large percentage of the microbial community
that did not match any of the know sequences on the existing database.

CHAPTER FIVE: IMPACT OF ENVIRONMENTAL AND
OPERATIONAL PARAMETERS ON NITRIFYING
COMMUNITY AND PLANT PERFORMANCE

5.1

INTRODUCTION

The activated sludge has been largely successful in treating municipal wastewater;
however, it is sensitive to operational or environmental variations, as well as toxic
loading (Kim et al., 2011). There are a number of physiochemical and operational
factors that affect the success of nitrification in WWTPs. It has been reported that
factors such as high ammonia concentration and low dissolved oxygen (DO) level can
result in the disruption of the equilibrium between the two nitrification steps, resulting
in significant reduction in the activities of nitrite oxidizers which can lead to toxic
nitrite build-up and a subsequent failure of nitrification process (Mbakwe et al., 2013).
The nitrifying populations are also sensitive to variability in pH, temperature,
alkalinity, NH3–N and NO2–concentrations, the presence of inhibitory or toxic
substances which often lead to failure of the system (Kim et al., 2011). Nitrification
could also be impacted by influent variability, organic loading, Sludge retention time
(SRT) and Food/microorganism ratio (F/M ratio). A balance between the two linked
ammonia and nitrite oxidation steps is required for nitrification to proceed efficiently.

Nitrification efficiency of a WWTP can be determined by directly monitoring the
nitrogen species biotransformation (plant’s) in the wastewater treatment plants. Also
the biomass from the WWTP can be used in laboratory batch experiments to estimate
the nitrification capacity of activated sludge in the full-scale plant (Yu et al., 2011).
Generally, this laboratory batch estimation is done in terms of the specific ammonia
oxidizing rate (SAOR) and specific nitrite formation rate (SNFR) (Yu et al., 2011; Li
et al., 2013). SAOR and SNFR are usually estimated from the rates of decrease in
NH4+–N concentration and increase in NO3−–N concentration over time. These have

83

been used in determining the activities of activated sludge biomass in oxidizing
ammonia and nitrite respectively (Yu et al., 2010; Yu et al., 2011; Li et al., 2013).
In a quest for rational design of functionally stable biological wastewater treatment
systems there is need to understand the basic relationships between microbial
community structure, its dynamics and functional stability (Gentile et al., 2007). Also
there is need to study and understand the effects of various environmental factors on
the two bacterial groups and on the overall nitrification in order to know how best to
operate the reactor for maximum nitrification and stability. The aim of this chapter was
to quantify the dominant nitrifying bacterial populations using qPCR and determine
their nitrification performance. The cross-correlational relationship existing between
the nitrifier populations (copy numbers) and the plant’s nitrification performance was
also determined.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

5.2.1

Wastewater treatment plant operation and samples

The configuration, wastewater characteristics and operational parameters for the plant
under investigation are shown in Table 3.1. The detailed sampling procedure for this
study is also shown in section 3.2.2.

5.2.2

Process monitoring and chemical analysis

The collected samples were filtered with MN 85/90 filter papers (Macherey – Nagel,
Germany) and the supernatant were analysed for the nitrogen species (NH4+ −N, NO2−N, NO3- −N) using Thermo Scientific™ Gallery™ Automated Photometric Analyser
(Vantaa, Finland) (Appendix 1). Samples for chemical oxygen demand (COD)
measurement were first digested according to standard method 5220D (APHA, 1998)
– closed reflux colorimetric method – in the microwave digester (Milestone Start D,
Sorisole, Italy) at 150oC for 1 h in COD vials containing the digestion solution
(Appendix 2). The COD concentration in the resulting digest was measured using

84

Gallery™ Automated Photometric Analyser. Temperature, dissolved oxygen (DO)
concentrations and pH measurements were done on-site using a portable YSI meter
(YSI 556 Multiprobe System). The mixed liquor suspended solids (MLSS) was also
measured using standard methods (APHA, 1998).

5.2.3

Calculating nitrification rate of the wastewater treatment plant

Nitrification rates in the plant were calculated based on the parameters monitored in
the plant and the information supplied by the plant operators (Surmacz-Górska, 2000;
Ramdhani et al., 2013) in this study. The nitrification rate was calculated according to
the equation below:
𝑅𝑛𝑖𝑡𝑟𝑖𝑓𝑖𝑐𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛 =

𝑄𝑖𝑛[𝑁𝐻4+ – 𝑁]𝑖𝑛 – [𝑁𝐻4+ – 𝑁]𝑜𝑢𝑡 )
𝑉𝑟𝑒𝑎𝑐𝑡𝑜𝑟𝑠 [𝑀𝐿𝑆𝑆]𝑟𝑒𝑎𝑐𝑡𝑜𝑟𝑠

Where:
𝑅𝑛𝑖𝑡𝑟𝑖𝑓𝑖𝑐𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛 = rate of plant’s nitrification
𝑄𝑖𝑛 = influent flowrate (L3/ T)
[𝑀𝐿𝑆𝑆]𝑟𝑒𝑎𝑐𝑡𝑜𝑟𝑠 = Mixed liquor suspended solid of the reactor (M/L3) and
𝑉𝑟𝑒𝑎𝑐𝑡𝑜𝑟𝑠 = reactor working volume (L3).

5.2.4

Batch experiment for specific nitrification rate determination

Specific nitrification rate which includes specific ammonium oxidization rate (SAOR)
and specific nitrate formation rate (SNFR) were measured on sampling days in the
laboratory according to the method previously described (Zhang et al., 2009b). Batch
experiments were performed to evaluate the variations of nitrification activities of
activated sludge (AOB, and NOB) in the bioreactor. Sludge sample (100 ml) from the
aerobic tank was centrifuged at 8,000 rpm for 10 min and then washed with buffer
medium to remove the background concentrations of nitrogen. The biomass (pellet)

85

was then transferred to a 250-ml Erlenmeyer flask and suspended with 100 ml of
mineral medium. This was performed in a shaking incubator at 30oC. Samples were
taken at an interval of 30 min to analyse the concentrations of NH4+-N and NO2--N.
The SAOR and SNFR was determined by monitoring the decreased rate of NH4+-N
concentration and NO2--N concentration versus time, respectively.

5.2.5

DNA extraction

Genomic DNA was extracted from sludge samples (aerobic samples) as described in
section 3.2.4. The quality and quantity of the extracted DNA was ascertained with
NanoDrop ND-1000 spectrophotometer (NanoDrop Technologies, USA). The
extracted genomic DNA was stored at –20oC until further use.

5.2.6

Standard curve preparation for quantitative real-time PCR analysis

Individual standard curves were prepared for different species of nitrifiers using
purified 16S rRNA gene fragments (target DNA) obtained from PCR-amplified
Nitrobacter spp. (FGPS872f and FGPS1269r), Nitrospira spp. (NSR1113F and
NSR1264R) and AOB (amoA-1F and amoA-2R) respectively (Lienen et al., 2014).
The concentrations (µg/µl) of the purified DNA (purified 16S rRNA gene fragments)
used as templates for the standard were determined using NanoDrop ND-1000
spectrophotometer (NanoDrop Technologies, USA). This was used in calculating their
copy numbers, which was based on their molecular weight and Avogadro’s number
(Trivedi et al., 2009). The formula used in estimating the copy number is as shown
below:
(Amount in ng x Avogadro′ s number)
𝑁𝑢𝑚𝑏𝑒𝑟 𝑜𝑓 𝑐𝑜𝑝𝑖𝑒𝑠 =
Lenght in bp x 1 x 109 x 650

86

The average weight of a base pair (bp) is 650 Daltons and Avogadro’s number is
6.022×1023. The Ten-fold serial dilutions of the target DNA were prepared from 108
to 102 copy numbers.
5.2.7

Quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) analysis

The real time PCR quantification was carried out with the primer sets targeting
different species of nitrifiers (Table 5.1) according to the modified method described
by Steinberg and Regan (2009). A Bio-Rad C1000 Touch Thermal Cycler-CFX96
Real-Time System (BIO-RAD, USA) was employed for the qPCR. The qPCR reaction
mixture was made up of 8 μl of SsoFast EvaGreen Supermix (Bio-Rad Laboratories
Pty Ltd, USA), 1 μl of each primer (final concentration of 0.4 μM), 4 μl of template
DNA (final concentration of 1 ng), and molecular grade water to a final volume of 20
μl. A modified Steinberg and Regan (2009) amplification protocol was employed
(Table 5.2). For each experimental set up, appropriate negative controls containing no
genomic DNA were subjected to the same amplification condition. The specificity of
each qPCR assay was confirmed by using both melting curve analysis and agarose gel
electrophoresis.

In each assay, a plot of the threshold cycle (Cq) against the logarithmic starting quantity
value of every 16S rRNA gene fragment (target DNA) was made and the standard
curve with linear range having regression analysis correlation co-efficient (R2) value
that is greater than 0.98 was considered suitable (Kumari et al., 2009; Yapsakli et al.,
2011). In addition, each qPCR assay with standard curve having suitable efficiency
(90 to 110 %), and slope ranging from –3.58 to –3.1 only were considered. In order to
quantify the 16S rRNA gene concentration of each nitrifier in the unknown DNA
sample, the Cq values of each sample was interpolated into the respective standard
curve.

Statistical Analysis

GraphPad Prism version 5.00 for Windows (GraphPad Software, San Diego California
USA) was used in carrying out Pearson correlation, one-way analysis of variance and
unpaired t-test. Microsoft Excel 2010 was used in calculating standard deviation.

RESULTS

5.3.1

Process performance and operational conditions

A full-scale system treating municipal wastewater was monitored for 237 days. The
sampling regime was divided into two: phase 1 (winter) which lasted from the 1st day
up till the 78th day; and phase 2 (summer) which was from 79th to 237th day. The
average precipitation of the study site, influent wastewater characteristics and
operational parameters measured in the plant during the study period is shown in Table
3.1. The temperature recorded in the aeration tanks ranged from 14.2oC to 25.1oC (Fig.
5.1a). The average temperature during summer and winter seasons were 22.8±1.5 and
16.5±2.0 oC respectively. The aeration tanks had fifteen surface aerators for sludge
mixing. Simultaneous breakdown of two to three aerators was frequently observed
during the sampling at the plant. The average DO concentration in the aeration tank
during the summer and winter were 0.60±0.10 and 0.66±0.40 mg/l respectively (Fig.
5.1a).

The influent COD load varied during the sampling period with an overall average of
999.3±694 mg/L. The lowest influent COD (377 mg/l) load was recorded during
summer, whereas the highest COD load of 1340 mg/l was observed during winter (Fig.
5.1b). The plant showed an efficient COD removal rate during the two seasons
(95.44±2.754%). The average mixed liquor suspended solids (MLSS) of 6157±783
mg/l was recorded during winter whereas it was 5070±1172 in summer (Fig. 5.2a).
The SRT of the plant was lower during summer (average of 22 days) as compared to
the winter period (average of 25 days). The pH in the reactor over the entire sampling

89

period (winter and summer seasons) was relatively stable with a mean of 7.3±0.2 pH
units (Table 3.1).

The average influent ammonia concentrations during the first 78th days (winter) was
31.69±6.04 mg/L whilst it was 24.47±4.58 mg/l during the summer. The effluent
NH4+–N concentrations were 3.40 and 13.24 mg/l summer and winter respectively (Fig
5.2b). The influent and effluent nitrite concentrations were always lower than 1 mg/l
during winter and summer periods. The nitrogen removal performance of the plant in
terms of ammonia is shown in Fig 5.2. There was a significant variation in ammonia
removal efficiency across the two seasons. The average ammonia removal during
winter was 60.0±18.0% whereas it was 83.0±13.5% during summer and this was found
to correlate with temperature (r = 0.7671; P = 0.0008). The ammonia removal also
demonstrated significant correlation with the AOB population (copies/l) (r = 0.55; P
=0.03).

Nitrification rate

In this study, the plant’s highest nitrification rate was observed during the summer
with an average of 0.085±0.020 g N-NH4+ g MLSS-1 d-1; whereas the lowest average
rate of 0.063±0.054 g N-NH4+ g MLSS-1 d-1 was recorded during winter (Fig. 5.3).
Nitrification rate of the plant ranged from 0.022 to 0.071 g N-NH4+ g MLSS-1 d-1 during
winter whilst it was between 0.035 and 0.138 g N-NH4+ g MLSS-1 d-1 during summer.
The percentage ammonia removal (Fig. 5.2) and the calculated nitrification rate of the
plant (Fig. 5.3) showed a significant correlation (r = 0.74; P = 0.003). The nitrification
rates of the plant during the period investigated is shown in Fig 5.3. At the peak of
winter, when the lowest temperature (Fig. 5.1) of 14oC was recorded on day 64,
nitrification rate was 0.022 N-NH4+ g MLSS-1 d-1 (Fig. 3) which was the lowest
recorded during the study.

Specific nitrification rate determination by batch experiment

The specific nitrification rate of the biomass in terms of specific ammonium
oxidization rate (SAOR) and specific nitrate formation rate (SNFR) were determined
in a laboratory batch experiment (Fig. 5.4). The SAOR obtained ranged between 0.010
and 0.148 g N g-1 MLSS d-1 whilst SNFR was from 0.1700 to 0.6310 g N g-1 MLSS d1

. The highest values of both SAOR and SNFR recorded during the batch experiment

were 0.1488 and 0.6310 g N g-1 MLSS d-1 respectively. These values were obtained
from the biomass taken during summer period (day 88). The estimated SNFR from the
batch experiment was higher than the SAOR all through the experiment. A significant
correlation was observed between the plant’s nitrification rate and SAOR (r = 0.65; P
= 0.04). The SNFR (r = 0.70; P = 0.02) also had a significant correlation with the
plant’s nitrification rate.

Quantification of AOB and NOB

Parameters for the qPCR standard curve, obtained after optimization is shown in Table
5.3 below. The qPCR efficiencies were between 90 and 110 % and the standard curves
were linear over six order of magnitude (R2>0.99) (Fig. 5.5). The AOB population
abundance was quantified using the primer set targeting the amoA (ammonia
monooxygenase) gene locus whereas Nitrospira and Nitrobacter 16S rDNA were
targeted for the NOB (Table 5.1). The AOB abundance was within the range of 1.6 x
107 – 1.7 x 109 copies/l. The Nitrospira and Nitrobacter spp. were found to be 2.4 x
108 – 3.8 x 109 copies/l and 9.3 x 109 – 1.4 x 1011 copies/l respectively. The Nitrobacter
spp. abundance was highest during the study, having about 2 orders of magnitude
above the AOB throughout the study. The Nitrobacter spp. was the dominant NOB
throughout this study. The changes in AOB, Nitrospira spp. and Nitrobacter spp.
abundance across the study period is shown in Fig. 5.6 below. A significant correlation
was found between the AOB (amoA gene) copy numbers and temperature in the
reactors (α= 0.05; P=0.0498). The lowest AOB abundance was recorded during the
winter, whereas there was no correlation observed between the NOB and temperature.
The NOB population remained almost stable with slight shifts throughout the sampling
period (Fig. 5.6).

DISCUSSION

Seasonal temperature variation has been implicated as one of the environmental factors
affecting nitrification rates in wastewater treatment facilities (Kim, 2013; Arévalo et
al., 2014). In this study, a significant seasonal variations in temperature (α= 0.05; P=<
0.0001) was observed in the reactor. The experimental site had its highest rainfall
during its summer season as observed during the study (Table 3.1). The dilution effect
of the rainfall contributed to lowering the plant’s loading rates during summer (Table
3.1). There was a significant variation in the influent ammonia concentration of the
plant. The average influent ammonia concentration was 24.5±4.6 mg/l during summer
whilst it was 31.7±6.1 mg/l in winter. The highest NH3 concentration in the effluent
(17.4 mg/l) was observed during the winter period when the temperature was 16.0oC
(Fig 5.2). The lowest ammonia removal of 12.1% and AOB abundance (1.6 x 108 ±

97

Ammonia removal (%)

1.010 13

1.3 x 107 copies/l) were observed when the lowest temperature (14.2oC) was recorded
(Figs. 5.2 and 5.6). Similarly, Kim et al. (2008) earlier noted a significant correlation
between temperature and ammonia oxidation. In this study, a reduction in the average
NH3 removal efficiency of the plant from 83.0±13.0% during summer (day 1 – 78) to
60.0±18% during winter (day 79 – 237) was observed. This was also found to correlate
significantly with seasonal temperature fluctuation (α= 0.05; P=0.0008). However,
neither temperature nor NOB population density had correlation with nitrite oxidation
rate of the plant. The non-correlational relationship observed between NOB and the
plant’s operational parameters could be because of the cross-correlation approach that
was employed. It has been noted that several parameters interact simultaneously to
influence the biological process under the uncontrolled environment which prevails in
the full-scale WWTP (Kim et al., 2011). Hence, there is need for an advanced
nonlinear modelling tool in order to be able to determine some of the relationships that
exists in the WWTP.

The highest percentage ammonia-nitrogen removal (83 ± 13%) and nitrification rate
(0.138 N-NH4+ g MLSS-1 d-1) were recorded at the plant during summer. The SAOR
was found to be lower than the SNFR throughout the study period with the average
values of 0.07036 and 0.4368 g N g-1 MLSS d-1 respectively. This is in accordance
with earlier findings in an aerobic batch experiment, where a lower SAOR was
obtained in comparison to SNFR (Fujita et al., 2010). Furthermore, it was observed
that the SAOR and SNFR obtained had no proportional relationship with ammonia and
nitrite-oxidation measured in their experiment (Fujita et al., 2010). However, in the
current study, both SAOR and SNFR obtained showed significant correlation with the
plant’s nitrification rate. Moreover, the specific nitrification (SNFR and SAOR) results
obtained in this study reflects the population densities (higher NOB copy numbers
compared to AOB) of the nitrifiers obtained using qPCR. This demonstrates that
specific nitrification rate determined in the laboratory batch experiment, can serve as
an indicator of the plant’s nitrifying community and performance. Yu et al. (2011)
reported similar finding in which the SAOR and SNFR obtained were related to the
AOB: NOB ratio in a batch experiment.

98

The quantitative PCR results revealed the constant dominance of Nitrobacter spp.
among the nitrifier’s community and the NOB was clearly more abundant than AOB
throughout the study. Due to the limiting oxygen levels observed (Table 5.3), there
was a possibility of nitrite-loop and hence an increased NOB population. The average
copy number of AOB to NOB ratio varied from 0.11 (summer) to 0.02 (winter) during
the period investigated (Fig. 5.6), which was lower than the theoretical ratio of 2.0
reported for good nitrification (Winkler et al., 2012). However, low AOB/NOB ratios
of 0.2 and 0.3 was recorded by Winkler et al. (2015) in an investigation of a lab-scale
and pilot-scale aerobic granular sludge. It was observed that an increase in temperature
and/or a decrease in DO level led to an elevated NOB/AOB ratio (Winkler et al., 2015).
Seasonal temperature was observed to have positive correlation with the AOB gene
copy number (r = 0.5; P = 0.05) whereas NOB was not affected by the temperature
shifts (Fig. 5.6). This result is consistent with earlier findings, which revealed that
AOB abundance had correlation with the wastewater effluent quality; with AOB
population decrease resulting in nitrification rate reduction (LaPara and Ghosh, 2006;
Zhang et al., 2009a).

Under low DO level, denitrifiers can carry out incomplete nitrate reduction which can
serve as additional nitrite source for NOB and partially uncouple their growth from
AOB, thereby resulting in their elevated population density (Winkler et al., 2012). Liu
(2012) noted that NOB exhibited a significant O2 affinity under prolonged low DO
concentrations (0.16 - 0.37 mg/l) which in turn made them a better competitor for O2
as their abundance increased comparably to AOB. Another possible reason for the
higher population load of NOB observed in this study could be due to the fact that
under extended period of low dissolved oxygen concentrations (<= 0.5 mg/l) the
endogenous decay of both ammonia/nitrite oxidizing bacteria would be retarded (Liu
and Wang, 2013). According to Liu and Wang (2013), this reduced endogenous decay
would result in increased biomass density which would nullify some low DO impact
on nitrification. They also reported near complete nitrification with 0.16 - 0.37 mg/l
DO range. Furthermore, they noted that under extended low DO period, NOB
demonstrated significant increase in O2 affinity which in turn made them a better O2

99

competitor than AOB. However, it is important to note that these results were based
on laboratory experiments, unlike the different scenario in this study, involving a fullscale plant where more than one factor influence each other.

The dominance of Nitrospira (K-strategist) over Nitrobacter (r – Strategist) in
activated sludge has been previously reported (Yapsakli et al., 2011; Ye et al., 2011),
however in this study a contrary observation was noted. The Nitrobacter/Nitrospira
ratio was 5.4 and 10.2 during summer and winter respectively. This could possibly be
explained based on the earlier observations of Nogueira and Melo (2006); and Wagner
et al. (2002) in which irreversible prevalence of Nitrobacter spp. over Nitrospira spp.
in WWTP after a spike in nitrite concentration and even after subsequent reduction in
nitrite concentration was recorded. Nitrobacter usually exhibit inhibitory effect on the
growth of Nitrospira once it dominates. Fukushima et al. (2013) also reported that
Nitrobacter spp., though a weak competitor compared to Nitrospira under low nitrite
concentration, can be selected over Nitrospira spp. in plants with low inorganic carbon
in addition to low nitrite concentration. The plant studied had low AOB population
density which could result in lowered rate of ammonia conversion to nitrite. This could
probably give a selective advantage to Nitrobacter spp. as observed in this study.
Furthermore,

et

al.

(2015)

observed

an

high

Nitrobacter/Nitrospira ratios in different aerobic reactor. They observed an increase
in the ratio from 1.5 to 3.5 when the temperature increased from 10oC to 30oC.

CONCLUSIONS

 The seasonal dynamics of nitrifying community in full-scale municipal bioreactor was
investigated and there was a significant difference in the nitrification efficiency of the
plant during the two seasons monitored with a two-fold increase in nitrification
observed during summer compared to winter.
 The ammonia removal efficiency of the plant had a significant linear correlation with
the AOB population density of the plant. However, no significant correlation could be

100

established between NOB and operational parameters, which may be due to the crosscorrelational approach used. Hence, there is need for the application of a nonlinear
modelling approach such as ANFIS, in order to determine the relationship.
 There was a significant correlation between the nitrification rates of the plant and the
batch specific nitrification rate (in terms of SAOR) determined in the laboratory
experiment. Hence, the specific ammonia oxidation rate (SAOR) can be used as
indication of nitrifying population densities and nitrification performance of
wastewater treatment plants.

INTELLIGENCE FOR EVALUATING OPERATIONAL
PARAMETERS INFLUENCING NITRIFICATION AND
NITRIFIERS IN AN ACTIVATED SLUDGE PROCESS

6.1

INTRODUCTION

Harnessing chemolithotrophic nitrifiers’ ability to remove ammonia from wastewater,
is one of the primary tasks in protecting water resources from pollution discharges
(Wang et al., 2012). However, these nitrifying bacteria are highly sensitive to changes
in environmental parameters and plant operational conditions, such as pH,
temperature, dissolved oxygen (DO) level, organic loading rate (OLR), ammonia
loading rate (ALR) and hydraulic retention time (HRT) (Hu et al., 2009). Neutral to
slightly basic pH range (7.5 to 8.5) has been reported as optimum for efficient
nitrification (Fulweiler et al., 2011). According to an earlier finding, at neutral pH,
99% of ammonia was removed, however, this dropped to about 75% at a basic pH of
9.7 whilst acidic pH (4.8) resulted in an impaired removal efficiency of 56% (Hu et
al., 2009). Although it was reported that nitrification would proceed at a temperature
range of 20°C to 37°C (Stark, 1996), nonetheless niche differentiation exists among
the members of NOB group, with Nitrobacter having preference for relatively low
temperatures (24 – 25°C) whist Nitrospira thrives at higher temperatures (29 – 30°C)
(Huang et al., 2010a). Kim et al. (2011) demonstrated that, raising temperature from
20 to 30oC resulted in a 5.3-fold increase in ammonia oxidation, and a 2.6-fold increase
in nitrite oxidation.

Lower nitrification performance has been observed at higher organic loading due to
the competition for DO between total bacteria and nitrifying organisms (autotrophic
bacteria) in wastewater treatment system (Wu et al., 2013). Huang et al. (2010a)
demonstrated that higher DO concentrations were more suitable for Nitrobacter
growth, whilst Nitrospira was selectively enriched when DO concentrations were less
than 1.0 mg/L. The available carbon substrate for the unit mass of microorganism

103

(known as F/M ratio) can also impact nitrification. A study by Wu et al. (2013)
suggested that high F/M ratio should be avoided to minimize its negative impact on
nitrification, and it indicated that F/M between 0.2 and 0.4 was the optimum range for
nitrification. The influence of HRT on nitrification efficiency was also observed when
HRT decreased from 30 to 5 h with a resultant increase in specific ammoniumoxidizing and nitrate-forming rates (Li et al., 2013). Additionally, the decrease in HRT
led to a reduction of AOB population density, whereas the NOB, especially the fast
growing Nitrobacter spp., increased significantly (Li et al., 2013).

Modelling of a full-scale wastewater treatment plant (WWTP), operated under an
uncontrolled environment, requires advanced nonlinear modelling tools to simulate the
complex relationships between inputs and outputs (Kim et al., 2011). According to
Klemetti (2010), due to simultaneous dependence on different factors, competition
between microbial groups are usually nonlinear. Artificial intelligence (AI) is an
example of a nonlinear system that is capable of depicting the interactive influence
between variables as well as their correlation with the simulation output (Nasr et al.,
2015b). AI incorporates artificial neural network (ANN), fuzzy inference system (FIS)
and adaptive-neuro fuzzy inference system (ANFIS). ANN has the ability to model
nonlinear systems efficiently, owing to their high accuracy, adequacy and quite
promising applications in engineering (Nasr et al., 2012). FIS allows a logical datadriven modelling approach, which uses "if–then" rules and logical operators to
establish qualitative relationships among the variables (Nasr et al., 2014).

ANFIS is a neuro-fuzzy system that has the potential to capture the benefits of both
ANN and FIS in a single framework (Nasr et al., 2015b). Moreover, ANFIS can handle
complex and highly nonlinear relationships between several parameters, without the
difficult task of dealing with deterministic non-linear mathematics (Nasr et al., 2015a).
Modelling based on ANFIS needs a little knowledge about the process to track given
input/output data. In this context, it is expected that the effect of system operation on
nitrification process could be studied using ANFIS. To the best of our knowledge, this

104

is the first study applying ANFIS technique to describe the nitrification performance
at a full-scale wastewater treatment plant subjected to dynamic operational parameters.
In this chapter, the focus was to evaluate the influence of operational and
environmental parameters, on nitrification and the different nitrifiers’ population
abundance in the plant, using an advanced nonlinear modelling tool (ANFIS). ANFIS
results were further validated with cross-correlation coefficients and quadratic models.

The full-scale WWTP under study is situated midlands of KwaZulu-Natal province,
South Africa. The plant description has been given previously (Section 3.2.1 and Fig.
3.1).

6.2.2

Sampling protocol

The WWTP was monitored for a period of 237 days; i.e. from May to July 2012 and
from November 2012 to March 2013. The sampling protocol is as described in Section
3.2.2.

6.2.3

DNA extraction and real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) amplification

The freeze-thaw DNA extraction procedure employed in this study has been
previously described in Section 3.2.4. The qPCR was carried out as described in
chapter 4. For the quantitative real-time PCR, the primers already described in Table
4.1 were used. The optimized protocols used for quantifying the nitrifiers are shown
in Table 4.2. To confirm amplification of the correct product, the amplicons from
qPCR were electrophoresed in 1.2% (wt/vol) agarose gel for the presence of the
expected gene product sizes. The qPCR standard curve parameters used for the
analysis are listed in Table 4.3.

Adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system (ANFIS)

6.2.5.1 Architecture of ANFIS
To present the ANFIS architecture, two fuzzy "if–then" rules based on a first-order
Takagi–Sugeno fuzzy model were considered:
Rule-1: If ( x is A1 ) and ( y is B1 ) then ( f1 = p1 x + q1 y + r1 )
Rule-2: If ( x is A2 ) and ( y is B2 ) then ( f 2 = p2 x + q2 y + r2 )
Where x and y are the inputs,

Ai and Bi are the fuzzy sets, f i are the outputs within

the fuzzy region specified by the fuzzy rule;

pi , qi and ri are the design parameters

determined during the training process.

As shown in Fig. 6.1, the ANFIS architecture to implement these two rules has a total
of five layers, in which a circle indicates a fixed node, whereas a square indicates an
adaptive node. The functioning of each layer can be described as follows (Jang, 1993):

Where ai ,

bi and ci are the MF parameters, governing the bell-shaped functions

accordingly.

Layer-2 (Rule nodes): In the second layer, the nodes are labelled with M , indicating
that they perform as a simple multiplier. The AND/OR operator is used to get one
output that represents the antecedent of the fuzzy "if–then" rule. The outputs of this
layer are defined as firing strengths of the rules. Each node analyses the firing strength
by cross multiplying all the incoming signals (Eq. 8).

(Eq. 8)

108

Layer-3 (Average nodes): In the third layer, the nodes are labelled with N ,
demonstrating that they play a normalization role to the firing strengths from the
previous layer. Thus, outputs of this layer are called "normalized firing strengths". As
shown in Eq. 9, the ith node calculates the ratio of the ith rules firing strength to the
sum of all rules’ firing strengths.

(Eq. 9)

Layer-4 (Consequent nodes): In this layer, every node i is an adaptive node with a node
function. The output of each node is the product of the normalized firing strength and
a first order polynomial (for a first-order Sugeno model). Hence, the outputs of this
layer are expressed by Eq. 10.

Where wi is the output of layer-3, and { pi , qi , ri } are consequent parameters,

Layer-5 (Output node): In the fifth layer, there is only one single fixed node labeled
with  . The single node computes the overall output as the summation of all incoming
signals. Thus, the overall output of the model is given by Eq. 11 as follows:

6.2.5.2 Application of ANFIS
The function exhsrch in MATLAB was used to select the set of inputs that
considerably impact the nitrification activity. Theoretically, exhsrch builds an ANFIS
model for each combination and trains it for one epoch, sequentially reports the
performance achieved. ANFIS uses a hybrid learning algorithm to tune the parameters
of a Sugeno-type fuzzy inference system (Azar, 2011). The algorithm uses a
combination of the least-squares and back-propagation gradient descent methods to
model a training data set (Jang, 1993). The dataset is randomly classified into training
(70%) and checking (30%) arguments. The training process stops if the designated
epoch number is reached or the error goal is achieved, whichever comes first. The
checking data are used for testing the generalization capability of the ANFIS, and
monitor how well the model predicts the corresponding dataset output values.
Moreover, ANFIS validates models using a checking data set to test for overfitting of
the training data. Recently, this technique has been successfully implemented in the
field of wastewater treatment technology (Fawzy et al., 2015; Nasr et al., 2015a).

The results and discussion in this chapter was combine into a single section as it
appears in the already published article (Appendix Four: Microbial Ecology, DOI
10.1007/s00248-016-0739-3). Hence, it does not follow the separate “results” and
“discussion” format used in other chapters.

6.3

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

6.3.1

Environmental conditions and system performance

The winter season (1st – 78th d) experienced little or no rainfall resulting in an average
influent flow rate of 61,990 ± 2,172 m3 d-1, whilst it increased to 93,062 ± 18,106 m3
d-1 during the summer (79th – 237th day). The influent COD during the summer was
1.3-fold lower than in the winter due to the dilution effect of increased rainfall (Table
6.1). The OLR increased during summer with increasing flow rate, despite the lower

110

COD, and reached 4.5 ± 1.8 kg COD m-3 d-1. The deviations in OLRs could be
attributed to the variation in the type of influent as a result of commercial and industrial
activities occurring around the treatment plant. The F/M ratio was 0.6 ± 0.1 d-1 in the
winter and increased by 48% during the summer (Table. 6.1). There is no ideal F/M
ratio that can work for all activated sludge treatment systems. Previous studies indicate
that the recommended range for F/M ratio in conventional, completely mixed and high
rate activated sludge processes ranged between 0.2 – 0.4, 0.2 – 0.6 and 0.4 – 1.5 d-1,
respectively (Tchobanoglous and Burton, 1991).

Although the influent ammonia during summer was 1.2-fold lower than in winter, the
respective ALR increased by 18.8% resulting from the summer rainfall (Table. 6.1).
The ammonia removal efficiency improved from 60 ± 18 to 83 ± 13% although the
ALR rose from 121 ± 22 to 144 ± 29 g N-NH4+ m-3 d-1 through winter to summer,
respectively. The increase in ammonia removal efficiency and nitrification rate with
ALR indicated that ammonia concentration was not the nitrification limiting factor in
this plant. This suggested that other operational conditions had a greater influence on
the nitrification process rather than ALR. Results from this study (60.0 ± 18.0 - 83.0±
13.0%) were lower than the 97 - 99.9% ammonia removal that was obtained by
Campos et al. (1999) when the nitrifying activated sludge unit was subjected to high
nitrogen loading rates (up to 7,500 g N-NH4+ m-3 d-1).

The higher nitrification performance of the plant could be due to operation of the unit
under a controlled environment, where the nitrifying activated sludge was fed with
synthetic wastewater containing ammonia and other nutrient sources with regulated
pH. The influent nitrate concentration during the study period varied between 0.25 and
3.68 mg/l with an average value of 1.51 ± 0.77 mg/l (Fig. 5.3; Chapter 5). Nitrate
removal efficiencies exhibited 64.6 ± 27.6% and 88.0 ± 26.3% during winter and
summer seasons, respectively. The concentration of effluent nitrate during the winter
was 3.6-fold higher than summer. This might be an indication of the increased

111

NOB/AOB ratio during the winter that promotes nitrate accumulation and thus a higher
effluent nitrate concentration in winter (Zhang et al., 2012a; Mozumder et al., 2013).

The DO levels throughout the aeration tank varied between 0.24 and 1.27 mg/l, with
an average value of 0.63 ± 0.22 mg/l. The DO concentration in our study was lower
than the optimum value of 1.7 mg/l for a complete nitrification process (Ruiz et al.,
2003). The pH in the feed over the entire sampling period was relatively stable with
an average value of 7.2 ± 0.1, which is close to the optimum for nitrifiers (7.5 – 8.0)
(Ruiz et al., 2003). Ruiz et al. (2003) reported that at the range of pH 6.45 – 8.95, as
observed here, a complete nitrification to nitrate occurs, while at pH lower than 6.45
and higher than 8.95 would result in complete inhibition of nitrification.

6.3.2

Temporal changes in dominant nitrifiers’ abundance ratios

The AOB abundance was within the range of 1.55 × 108 – 1.65 × 1010 copies/l MLSS,
whereas the Nitrobacter spp. and Nitrospira spp. were found to be in the range of 9.32
× 109 – 1.40 × 1011 copies/l MLSS and 2.39 × 109 – 3.76 × 1010 copies/l MLSS,
respectively (Fig. 5.6). The Nitrobacter spp. abundance was 29-fold higher than AOB
throughout the study period showing a clear dominance of NOB in the selected WWTP
(Fig. 6.2). The average AOB to NOB ratio varied from 0.03:1 (winter) to 0.15:1
(summer), which was lower than the theoretical ratio of 2:1 reported for good
nitrification (Winkler et al., 2012). Due to the prevailing limiting oxygen levels (0.63
± 0.22 mg O2 l-1) in the reactor, there was a possibility of nitrite-loop. This
phenomenon usually occurs when denitrifiers reduce nitrate to nitrite supplying
additional nitrite for NOB, leading to a higher NOB/AOB ratio than theoretically
expected (Winkler et al., 2012). Additionally, Liu (2012) noted that under long-term
low DO, the oxygen affinity of NOB increases significantly, which makes NOB a
better competitor for oxygen compared to AOB. This high NOB/AOB ratio resulted
in sub-optimal ammonia transformation in this study. Whereas earlier studies have
recorded about 99% ammonia removal (Hu et al., 2009), in this study the highest NH3
removal that was recorded was 83 ± 13%.

A higher Nitrobacter: Nitrospira ratio of 7.4: 1.0 was also recorded. This could
possibly be explained based on the earlier observations of Wagner et al. (2002) and
Nogueira and Melo (2006). They noted an irreversible prevalence of Nitrobacter spp.
over Nitrospira spp. in WWTP after a history of spike in nitrite concentration, even
after subsequent reduction in nitrite concentration. Nitrobacter usually exhibit
inhibitory effect on the growth of Nitrospira once it dominates. Furthermore,
Fukushima et al. (2013) reported that Nitrobacter spp. can be selected over Nitrospira
spp. in plants with low inorganic carbon in addition to low nitrite concentration.
However, there have been no studies on the distribution of Nitrospira and Nitrobacter
in DO-limiting condition over an extended period of time at a full-scale WWTP.
Despite several other reports that Nitrospira spp. often are the dominant NOB in

6.3.3

Effect of operational conditions on specific nitrification rate

In this investigation, it was observed that the efficiency and effectiveness of a
nitrifying activated sludge system depended on several factors. The specific
nitrification rate (qN) showed a strong positive correlation to temperature (r 0.726, p
0.002). The qN noticeably increased by 2.2-fold and exhibited 26.6 ± 10.7 mg N-NH4+
g-1 MLSS d-1 during the summer season when the temperature was elevated to 22.4 ±
2.7°C. The ANFIS model indicated that temperature exhibited the least error,
demonstrating its relevance with respect to the qN (Fig. 6.3a). The considerable impact
of temperature on qN could be attributed to the high seasonal variation observed during
the monitored period. This observation was in agreement with previous studies, which
stated that increasing temperature could enhance the rate of nitrification and nitrifier

114

growth (Tarre and Green, 2004). Xu et al. (2012) reported that growth rate of nitrifiers
increased exponentially at a temperature range of 10 – 25°C, reaching a constant and
optimal growth rate between 25 and 35°C, however, at 40°C the growth rate
diminished drastically.

According to the ANFIS results in Fig. 6.3a, HRT has the second rank after
temperature regarding the operational conditions affecting qN. The current study
witnessed a significant increase in qN with a decrease in HRT (r -0.651, p 0.009). This
result was in agreement with a study by Li et al. (2013), where qN increased from 320
to 450 mg N-NH4+ g-1 MLSS d-1 (elevated by 41%) when the HRT decreased from 10
to 5 h, showing that the decline in HRT led to an enhancement in ammonia oxidation
activity. On the contrary, other studies have reported that lower HRT results in
increasing loading rates, which negatively affect the nitrifiers due to their competition
with heterotrophic bacteria for substrates (oxygen and ammonia) (Nogueira et al.,
2002). In our study, the negative trend between qN and HRT can be linked to the
seasonal change, which was the key factor in the development of nitrification, since
qN increased to 26.6 ± 10.7 mg N-NH4+ g-1 MLSS d-1 in summer season when
temperature increased to 22.4 ± 2.7ºC, while HRT declined to 4.3 ± 1.0 h.

In the current study, the qN showed a significant positive correlation with ALR (r
0.571, p 0.026). However, it was found that high concentration of ammonia in the
influent can negatively affect nitrification due to substrate inhibition by free ammonia
(Kim et al., 2006). This discrepancy could be attributed to the fact that the ALR of 120
- 140 g N-NH4+ m-3 d-1 observed in our study was still lower than the inhibitory limits
reported in previous studies (Campos et al., 1999; Kim et al., 2006). For example,
Campos et al. (1999) investigated the possibilities of obtaining a full ammonia
oxidation at increasing ALR from 500 to 7,500 g N-NH4+ m-3 d-1. Additionally, Kim
et al. (2006) found that nitrification efficiency increased to 100% with N-NH4+ loading
of 700 g m-3 d-1 at 18°C, and leachate was completely nitrified up to a load of 1,500 g
N-NH4+ m-3 d-1 at 28°C.

115

Other operational conditions such as DO showed no significant effect on qN (r -0.141,
p 0.617). This observation was in agreement with a study by Kim et al. (2006), where
the DO was not a limiting factor for nitrification. Additionally, the role of pH in our
study was not significant when compared to other environmental conditions (p 0.332)
due to its narrow range of variation. The pH range observed in this study (6.97 – 7.47)
was within the optimal range for the metabolism and growth of autotrophic nitrifiers
(Zhang et al., 2012a).

Referring to the ANFIS model (Fig. 6.3a), the training and checking errors were
comparable, which implies that no overfitting occurred. This means that selection of
more than one input can be explored to re-build the ANFIS model. The plot in Fig.
6.3b showed all two input variable combinations and their influence on qN.

116

Fig. 6.3: Effect of operating conditions on qN (The left-most input variable is the most
relevance with respect to qN). a) Every input variable's influence on qN; b) All two
input variable combinations and their influence on qN.

It was found that HRT and F/M (the left-most input variable) formed the optimal
combination of two input attributes. Additionally, it was observed that the minimal
training and checking errors reduced significantly from that of the best 1-input model,
indicating that the combination of HRT and F/M improved the prediction performance.
A quadratic model was developed to confirm the ANFIS results by estimating the qN
over independent variables (HRT and F/M). The polynomial equation (Eq. 12),

117

including constant, linear, interaction, and squared terms, provided a determination of
coefficient (r2-value) with the experimental data of 0.50.

Effect of operational conditions on AOB

The AOB was found to be HRT dependent with r-value of -0.741 (p 0.002). The high
correlation between HRT and AOB was in accordance with the ANFIS results, where
HRT exhibited the least training error among other operational conditions (Fig. 6.4a).
It was found that AOB exhibited a negative correlation with the current range of HRT
(4.3 – 6.3 h). Similar results were reported by Li et al. (2013) where an enhancement
in AOB community was observed when HRT declined from 7 to 5 h. They also noted
that AOB had a positive correlation when HRT became higher than 10 h (Li et al.,
2013). Our results showed a good correlation between AOB and temperature (r 0.517
and p 0.048), indicating that temperature had a positive impact on the AOB
community. The positive correlation between temperature and AOB was previously
illustrated by Park et al. (2008), who found that low temperature could not only
decrease the attached biomass and activity of AOB, but also produced a change in the
composition of the AOB species. According to ANFIS results, the two variables, HRT
and temperature were the most relevant parameters with respect to AOB (Fig. 6.4a).
Our results suggested that an increase in AOB during the summer season resulted from
an increase in temperature in line with a decrease in HRT.

As noticed from the ANFIS model (Fig. 6.4b), interaction of HRT with other
environmental factors provided a reliable assessment of the plant performance. This

118

might be due to the fact that the current study was based on full scale observations
where several environmental parameters were interacting together in a dynamic
manner. The influence of two environmental parameters indicated that the
combination of HRT and temperature exhibited lower training error than either HRT
or temperature by 64% and 70%, respectively. These results further confirm our
hypothesis that the AOB dominated in summer season due to the impact of both HRT
and temperature.

most relevance with respect to AOB). a) Every input variable's influence on AOB; b)

120

Comparable to the qN results, the ANFIS model indicated that the combination of HRT
and F/M could be the most relevant input to the AOB (output) (Fig. 6.4b).
Subsequently, HRT and F/M were employed in a polynomial function of degree 2 to
determine their quadratic regression (Eq. 13). The estimated coefficient of
determination showed r2-value of 0.614.

Effect of operational conditions on NOB (Nitrobacter and Nitrospira)

The presence of NOB is necessary for wastewater treatment plants to achieve complete
nitrification. In this investigation, Nitrobacter spp. indicated no significant correlation
with the operational conditions (p > 0.1). This suggests that the abundance of
Nitrobacter could tolerate seasonal and environmental variations. The ANFIS model
indicated that F/M had the highest impact on Nitrobacter abundance (Fig. 6.5a). The
strength of the relationship between the F/M and Nitrobacter spp. was further
estimated by Pearson correlation coefficient which showed an r-value of 0.359 (p >
0.1). The importance of F/M was previously reported, where some organic compounds
in the wastewater positively affected the activity of NOB (Kim et al., 2006). The
ANFIS model was also used to identify relationships between Nitrobacter spp.
abundance and the combination of two operational parameters (Fig. 6.5b). The model
indicated that F/M and temperature form the optimal combination of two input
attributes. The polynomial equation of their quadratic interaction is presented in Eq.
14 (r2-value 0.49).

122

Cross-correlation coefficients indicated that increase in Nitrospira spp. was
significantly affected by a decline in HRT (r -0.627 and p 0.012). Similarly, the ANFIS
model showed that the input HRT exhibited the least training error (Fig. 6.6a), which
was in accordance with the p values. Additionally, HRT showed inverse correlation
with Nitrobacter spp. (r -0.364 and p > 0.1). Similarly, Li et al. (2013) reported that a
short HRT favoured the relative growth of NOBs, particularly the fast-growing
Nitrobacter spp., in the conventional activated sludge system. As observed from the
ANFIS results (Fig 6.6b), the combination of HRT and F/M exhibited a 4-fold
lowering of the training error when compared to HRT individually. Therefore, the
quadratic polynomial formula indicating the combinatory effect of HRT and F/M on
Nitrospira can be presented by Eq. 15 (r2-value 0.716).

In a similar study, Huang et al. (2010a) investigated the impact of environmental
variables on Nitrobacter and Nitrospira. They observed that, Nitrobacter populations
were negatively correlated to temperature (r -0.49 and p < 0.001), while the Nitrospira
abundance showed a strong positive correlation to temperature (r 0.59 and p < 0.0001).
Additionally, Nitrobacter populations were significantly and positively correlated to
DO (r 0.38 and p < 0.01). However, Nitrospira abundance showed a significantly
negative correlation to DO (r -0.46 and p < 0.01). Moreover, HRT showed a significant
impact on Nitrobacter spp. (r 0.334 and p < 0.05). When comparing our findings with
that of Huang et al. (2010a) both studies used the cross-correlation coefficients to
determine the significant impact of operational parameters on Nitrobacter and
Nitrospira. However, our study further applied artificial modelling technique in
confirming the r results, as well as to determine the optimum combination of two input
variables.

CONCLUSIONS

The AI approach succeeded in describing the effect of operating condition on
nitrification process. Results from the ANFIS model were in accordance with
Spearman's correlation coefficients, and it was concluded that:
 The qN was noticeably increased by 2.2-fold and exhibited 26.6 ± 10.7 mg NNH4+ g-1 MLSS d-1 when the temperature elevated from 16.5 ± 2.1 to 22.4 ±
2.7°C (r 0.726, p 0.002).
 The qN was also significantly affected by these individual parameters: HRT (r
-0.651, p 0.009) and ALR (r 0.571, p 0.026).
 HRT and F/M formed the optimal combination of two inputs affecting the q N,
and their quadratic equation showed r2-value of 0.50.
 AOB increased in the summer season, when temperature was 1.4-fold higher
than during winter (r 0.517, p 0.048), and HRT decreased by 31% as a result
of rainfall (r -0.741, p 0.002).

125

 No single input had a significant effect on Nitrobacter spp., indicating that the
abundance of Nitrobacter could tolerate seasonal and environmental variations
once the population is established in the system.
 Nitrospira spp. increased by 3.6 times when HRT declined during the summer
season (r -0.627, p 0.012).
 A polynomial function of 2nd degree for (HRT, F/M and AOB), (F/M,
temperature and Nitrobacter) and (HRT, F/M and Nitrospira) showed r2values of 0.61, 0.49 and 0.72, respectively.

CHAPTER SEVEN: GENERAL CONCLUSIONS AND
RECOMMENDATIONS

CONCLUSIONS
This study examined the nitrifying community structure in a full-scale municipal
wastewater treatment plant. The diversity and abundance of the different nitrifying
populations in the plant was investigated, and their impact on nitrification efficiency
was determined. A combination of FISH, PCR-clone library, quantitative polymerase
chain reaction (qPCR) and next generation sequencing was applied. The effect of
operating parameters and environmental conditions on nitrification was investigated.
ANFIS, Pearson’s correlation coefficient and quadratic models were used to determine
and rank the plant’s operational conditions that influenced the nitrification
performance.

The research succeeded in establishing the following key findings:
 PCR-clone libraries of environmental samples was limited in taxonomic
resolution, whereas pyrosequencing yielded a better detail in terms of
microbial diversity in activated sludge.
 The species richness among AOB in the plant was not high. Hence, the
community did not exhibit substantial congeneric homotaxis, which can impart
high functional redundancy on them.
 Pyrosequencing reveals higher diversity of AOB in the reactor during summer
that was characterized by higher temperature. Furthermore, N. oligotropha was
only identified during summer. This indicates that higher temperature elicited
increased AOB diversity.
 The AOB diversity was 6 times higher during summer than winter when a
higher NH3 removal rate and temperature were recorded. The AOB sequences
related to uncultured bacterium and uncultured AOB showed increase of 133%

127

and 360% respectively when the season changed from winter to summer. This
suggests that higher AOB diversity resulted in increased nitrification rate of
the activated sludge.
 There was a significant difference in the nitrification efficiency of the plant
during the two seasons monitored with a two-fold increase in nitrification
observed during summer compared to winter.
 The cross-correlational approach could not establish any significant correlation
between NOB population abundance and operational parameters except when
ANFIS was used.
 There was a significant correlation between the nitrification rates of the plant
and the batch specific nitrification rate (in terms of SAOR) determined in the
laboratory experiment. Hence, the specific ammonia oxidation rate (SAOR)
can be used as indication of nitrifying population densities and nitrification
performance of wastewater treatment plants.
 The qN was noticeably increased by 2.2-fold and exhibited 26.6 ± 10.7 mg NNH4+ g-1 MLSS d-1 when the temperature elevated from 16.5 ± 2.1 to 22.4 ±
2.7°C (r 0.726, p 0.002).
 Based on ANFIS, HRT and F/M formed the optimal combination of two inputs
affecting the qN, and their quadratic equation showed r2-value of 0.50.
 AOB increased in the summer season, when temperature was 1.4-fold higher
than during winter (r 0.517, p 0.048), and HRT decreased by 31% as a result
of rainfall (r -0.741, p 0.002).
 Using ANFIS, no single input had a significant effect on Nitrobacter spp.,
indicating that the abundance of Nitrobacter could tolerate seasonal and
environmental variations once the population is established in the system.

SIGNIFICANCE AND NOVELTY OF THE RESEARCH FINDINGS
 This study can be considered as novel since it was the first time pyrosequencing
was used for amoA locus profiling of AOB community composition in full scale
wastewater plants.

128

 The findings from the current study have set the foundation for future application
of these advanced molecular techniques in understanding the diversity and role of
uncultured AOB in wastewater treatment
 This study suggests that vast population of novel, ecologically significant AOB
species, which remain unexploited, still inhabit the complex activated sludge
communities.
 The PCR yielded no positive amplification for AOA, which could suggests that
archaea did not play an important role in the nitrification process of this WWTP
and may not be ubiquitous in all nitrifying WWTPs.
 Furthermore, novelty was demonstrated in this study since earlier studies on
nitrification used the cross-correlation coefficients to determine the significant
impact of operational parameters on nitrifiers. This study in addition to crosscorrelation, further applied artificial modelling technique in confirming the
results, as well as to determine the optimum combination of two input variables.
 This study indicated that artificial intelligence could be used as a tool to elucidate
the factors influencing nitrification process in full-scale wastewater treatment
plants. It further indicates that ANFIS, is better than conventional Spearman
correlation, since the latter could not (in some cases) detect correlation between
microbial populations (NOB) and plant’s operating parameters due to the nonlinearity of the interactions in wastewater treatment.

RECOMMENDATIONS
 There is need for more research effort towards isolating and characterization of the
nitrifying populations (AOB, AOA and NOB) in wastewater, as pyrosequencing
revealed a large diversity of uncultured AOB and previously unidentified
organisms.
 The operational conditions of the WWTP including HRT and loading rates should
be manipulated in order to overcome the diminishing nitrification arising from low
temperature during winter.

129

 The findings of the research would be workshopped with staff from Umgeni Water
Board whom commissioned the research.

APPENDIX TWO: Determination of total chemical oxygen demand (cod) in
wastewater sample
Procedure
Water samples for analysis were collected in bottles from the sampling points of both
full and pilot-scale UASB reactors. The closed reflux colorimetric method (APHA,
1998) with was used. The COD concentration in the wastewater was determined
according to the standard method 5220D, microwave digestion (Milestone Start D,
Sorisole, Italy) was first used to digest the samples at 150 °C for 1 h in COD vials
containing the Digestion Solution (0–15,000 mg COD/L). Then, the concentration was
measured using Aquakem Gallery discrete autoanalyser (Thermo Scientific, UK).
Five millilitre sample was measured and transferred into a microwave Teflon tube.
The Teflon tube was inserted into the microwave safety vessel. Three millilitre (3ml)
of digestion solution (0.01667M, K2Cr2O7) and 7 ml of sulphuric acid reagent were
carefully added to the sample. The sample was carefully mixed, tightly capped and
digested at 150oC for 55 minutes using the microwave digester (Milestone Start D,
Sorisole, Italy). Standard were prepared and blank reagent was also digested with the
sample as control. After cooling, the solution was transferred into Gallery cuvettes for
colorimetric analysis using the Thermo Gallery photometric analyser. Results were
recorded in mg/L.

Cell dispersion using sonication
Introduction:
The sludge was compact and thick. In order to get to all cells in the sludge, it is often
necessary to disperse the cells by sonication using a sonicator at low frequency, after
paraformaldehyde fixation.
Procedure:


Fill a 2 mL Eppendoff tube with 1 mL fixed sample.



In order to prevent spillage of the sample, slightly cover the opening of the
Eppendoff tube with the cover.



Insert the probe so that the tip of the probe is approximately 1 cm above the base
of the Eppendoff tube and sonicate 8 watts for 5 to 10 min for an ML =2500 3000

Immobilization of fixed microbial cells on treated microscope slides
Procedure:


Dilute sonicated sample in ddH2O



Spot 10 µL of sonicated sample onto each well of a pre-treated microscope slide.



Allow the spots to air dry



Dehydrate the spots through successive passages through 50%, 80% and 100% v/v
ethanol washes (lasting 3 min each).



Subsequently slides can be stored dry at room temperature in a desiccators
indefinitely.

Calculation of working probe dilution
Since 50 ng of probe is required per hybridization and 10 µL of hybridization solution
is required per spot, a working concentration of 5 ng/µL is used.
