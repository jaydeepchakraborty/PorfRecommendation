Since all confirmed transactions are visible to the public, the blockchain's inherent transparency has proven to be ineffective in preserving the anonymity of its users (legitimate users and cybercriminals alike). While Bitcoin addresses alone are not explicitly tied to any real-world entities, a number of recent research efforts have shown that monetary movements and address links can be traced throughout the blockchain data structure [3]­[8]. Even though there have been many attempts to enhance user privacy with varying degrees of success (i.e. generating multiple addresses, using bitcoin mixers such as Bitcoin Fog [8], or using privacy-enhancing overlays such as Coinjoin [9]), user privacy is further undermined when real-world information and quasi-identifiers found on the Internet can be imputed to users' Bitcoin addresses. Given Bitcoin's meteoric rise in popularity and scale, such a condition was inevitable and the overlap between publicly available data and blockchain data has improved identification and attribution throughout a vast, connected network of users-- there are addresses tied to forum usernames, anonymous online marketplaces, Bitcoin exchanges, and popular Bitcoin services. Privacy-preserving online services, such as the Tor hidden network [10] and the Bitcoin system, while undoubtedly useful in many aspects, play nontrivial roles in the burgeoning I.

Abstract--Bitcoin, a decentralized cryptographic currency that has experienced proliferating popularity over the past few years, is the common denominator in a wide variety of cybercrime. We perform a measurement analysis of CryptoLocker, a family of ransomware that encrypts a victim's files until a ransom is paid, within the Bitcoin ecosystem from September 5, 2013 through January 31, 2014. Using information collected from online fora, such as reddit and BitcoinTalk, as an initial starting point, we generate a cluster of 968 Bitcoin addresses belonging to CryptoLocker. We provide a lower bound for CryptoLocker's economy in Bitcoin and identify 795 ransom payments totalling 1,128.40 BTC ($310,472.38), but show that the proceeds could have been worth upwards of $1.1 million at peak valuation. By analyzing ransom payment timestamps both longitudinally across CryptoLocker's operating period and transversely across times of day, we detect changes in distributions and form conjectures on CryptoLocker that corroborate information from previous efforts. Additionally, we construct a network topology to detail CryptoLocker's financial infrastructure and obtain auxiliary information on the CryptoLocker operation. Most notably, we find evidence that suggests connections to popular Bitcoin services, such as Bitcoin Fog and BTC-e, and subtle links to other cybercrimes surrounding Bitcoin, such as the Sheep Marketplace scam of 2013. We use our study to underscore the value of measurement analyses and threat intelligence in understanding the erratic cybercrime landscape.

analytics. Our contributions are the following: · We design and implement a framework that collects data from the blockchain and automatically identifies ransom payments to Bitcoin addresses belonging to CryptoLocker. From this, we measure CryptoLocker's economy in Bitcoin and provide a lower-bound estimate of financial damages from September 5, 2013 through January 31, 2014. · We present a novel approach to analyzing Bitcoin transactions by examining ransom payment timestamps both longitudinally across CryptoLocker's operating period, as well as tranversely across times of day, to distinguish trends and changes in timestamp distributions. · We construct a non-trivial, topological network of CryptoLocker addresses and systematically examine CryptoLocker's financial infrastructure and money laundering strategies. By leveraging external, real-world data, we find connections to popular services such as Bitcoin Fog and BTC-e, and speculate connections to other Bitcoin cybercrime, such as the Sheep Marketplace heist. II. BACKGROUND To understand our analysis of the CryptoLocker economy, we first discuss the Bitcoin protocol in Section II-A, and we next discuss the CryptoLocker ransomware in Section II-B. A. Anatomy of a Bitcoin Transaction Bitcoin is a decentralized cryptographic currency that was proposed by Satoshi Nakamoto in 2008 [1]. A bitcoin can be abstracted as a chain of transactions among owners who are identifiable by public keys generated from an asymmetric encryption scheme2 . We will refer to these public keys as Bitcoin addresses, or simply addresses, throughout the rest of this paper. To transfer bitcoins, a user issues a transaction, which consists of a set of inputs, a set of outputs, and a change address. The inputs are Bitcoin addresses that belong to the payer. The outputs are Bitcoin addresses that identify the payee accounts, and the change address (which is optional) is where the leftover bitcoins from the transactions are sent (the change address belongs to the payer). Bitcoin's transaction protocol stipulates that inputs to a new transaction must reference the exact value of outputs from previous transactions. In other words, users must specify from whom they received the bitcoins, thus forming a chain of transactions, and inputs to a new transaction may reference as many previous transactions needed to sufficiently fund the new output. These are known as multiinput transactions. Finally, the payer digitally signs a hash3 of the transaction from which he or she received the bitcoins and the public key address of the payee. We illustrate Bitcoin's transaction protocol in Figure 1. We see that there are three transactions, A, B, and C, and we will refer to their respective owners as Alice, Bob, and Charlie. In transaction A, a transaction of 2.0 BTC sent to Alice is used as

Fig. 1. The diagram illustrates the anatomy of bitcoin transactions. We have transactions A, B, and C owned by Alice, Bob, and Charlie, respectively. We can see that previous transactions to Alice and Bob are referenced in their respective transactions to Charlie, forming a chain of transactions.

an input to a transaction of 1.5 BTC to Charlie. Since the input value exceeds the output value, the remaining 0.5 BTC is sent to a change address belonging to Alice. In transaction B, we see a similar scenario in which Bob transfers 1.0 BTC to Charlie, but a change address is not necessary because the input and output values were equivalent. In transaction C, we see that Charlie transfers 2.0 BTC to an unnamed user. To issue this transaction, transaction C references the two previous transactions, from Alice and Bob, that Charlie received as inputs. Again, the total input value exceeds the required output value, so 0.5 BTC are sent to a change address belonging to Charlie. We can see that the validity of a bitcoin is dependent on the correctness of each signature in the transaction chain, it is simple to verify a transaction's history but difficult to tamper with confirmed transactions that are deeply embedded in the blockchain (usually six blocks of confirmation is considered secure against double-spending attacks [12]). Therefore, Bitcoin transactions are essentially irreversible. This feature, coupled with Bitcoin's pseudonymity, enables cybercriminals to commit financial fraud that is virtually impossible to reverse and difficult to trace. B. CryptoLocker Ransomware On September 5, 2013, CryptoLocker emerged as a new family of ransomware that encrypted files on a victim's system until a ransom is paid [11]. The decryption keys were withheld by the threat actors who demanded ransoms to be paid either through MoneyPak or Bitcoin within 72 hours, otherwise the decryption keys would (allegedly) be destroyed and recovery of the encrypted files would be virtually impossible. CryptoLocker's infection vector took two forms. In its initial release, CryptoLocker threat actors primarily targeted business professionals via spam emails taking the form of "customer complaints" against recipients' organizations. Malicious executable files were attached in ZIP archives, which would aggressively encrypt all the files on a system if opened. Later versions of CryptoLocker, beginning on October 7, 2013, were distributed through Gameover ZeuS [13], a peer-to-peer botnet that used Cutwail spam botnet to send massive amounts of spam email impersonating well-established online retailers and

financial institutions. These emails typically spoofed invoices, order confirmations, or urgent unpaid balances to lure victims into following malicious links which redirected to CryptoLocker exploit kits. From September 2013 through early 2014, CryptoLocker infections were most prevalent in the United States. A study from the Dell SecureWorks Counter Threat Unit (CTU) research team [11] shows that from October 22, 2013 to November 1, 2013, 22,360 systems were infected in the United States, constituting 70.2% of global CryptoLocker infections. During this period, CryptoLocker was also prevalent in Canada, Great Britain, India, and several countries in the Middle East and South Central Asia. In a later sample, gathered from December 9, 2013 to December 16, 2013, during a sinkhole when CryptoLocker activity was limited, CryptoLocker infections became more dispersed. The concentration of infected systems in the United States dramatically declined to 23.8% (1,540 infected systems) and CryptoLocker activity became more prevalent in Great Britain (1,228 infected systems constituting 19.0% of global infections), Australia (836 infections constituting 12.9% of global infections), several other European countries, China, India, and Brazil. Although the United States is disproportionately represented in total global CryptoLocker infections, most ransom payments from the United States were issued through MoneyPak, an invariably more economical option than Bitcoin. This was due to bitcoin's price volatility at the time. Conversion rates soared from $120/BTC in September 2013 to well over $1,300/BTC in late November 2013. We show the exchange rate of US dollars and bitcoin throughout CryptoLocker's operational period in Figure 2. As a result, the CryptoLocker threat actors adjusted the ransom demand on several occasions to ensure that ransom demands were not exorbitant. Since, in almost all cases in the United States, there were no advantages to paying through the Bitcoin system, individuals who elected to pay via Bitcoin presumably resided in countries outside of the United States where MoneyPak was unavailable [11]. For this reason, bitcoin ransom payments represent only a small portion of the total financial damages caused by CryptoLocker. III. M EASUREMENT M ETHODOLOGY We next explain our approach to collecting information from the blockchain and various online fora in an effort to measure CryptoLocker's economy and generate threat intelligence on the CryptoLocker operation. We begin by highlighting how we generated an address cluster belonging to CryptoLocker, which we call SCL , from two seed addresses in Section III-A. Based on information from previous efforts and a preliminary examination of SCL , we designed and implemented a framework for identifying ransom payments from the set of all transactions sent to our cluster in Section III-B. A. Collecting and Generating Addresses To collect Bitcoin addresses belonging to CryptoLocker, we used an approach similar to M.

for forensic analysis of the blockchain. Initially, we found two known CryptoLocker addresses by manually investigating a reddit thread4 in which victims and researchers posted Bitcoin addresses belonging to the ransomware. We will refer to one of these seed addresses, which collected 27 ransom payments, as Aseed1 , and the other seed address, which collected 23 ransom payments, as Aseed2 , throughout the remainder of this paper. An interested reader can find the hashes of all Bitcoin addresses mentioned in the Appendix. To expand our dataset of addresses, we use the following two clustering heuristics (based on the Bitcoin transaction protocol detailed in Section II-A) to generate a set of Bitcoin addresses controlled by the same user(s), known as clusters [4]: 1) Multi-input Transactions: A multi-input transaction occurs when a user u makes a transaction in which the payment amount p exceeds the available bitcoins (references of prior payments to u) in u's wallet5 . In such a case, the Bitcoin protocol inputs a set of bitcoins B from u's wallet to sufficiently fund p. Therefore, we can conclude that if the bitcoins in B are owned by a set of distinct input addresses Si , the input addresses in Si are controlled by the same user u. 2) Change Addresses: The Bitcoin protocol generates a new change address in u's wallet to collect change when the sum of inputs in B exceeds p. When the set of output addresses So contains two addresses such that one is a newly generated address an and the other corresponds to a payment's destination address ad , we can conclude that an is a change address and is controlled by u. From Aseed1 , we generate a set of 968 Bitcoin addresses belonging to the CryptoLocker cluster, SCL , which happens to include Aseed2 . Although our study does not claim to be representative of the entire CryptoLocker population within the Bitcoin ecosystem, which is difficult to quantify due to a lack

of confirmed Bitcoin addresses belonging to CryptoLocker, we can systematically measure a subset of CryptoLocker's economy, SCL , and make inferences about CryptoLocker and its constituents. B. Ransom Identification Framework

IV. DATA OVERVIEW We begin by validating the accuracy of our data and showing how conservative our estimates are in Section IV-A. We then perform valuations of the CryptoLocker economy and measure ransom payments at different stages in its operational period in Section IV-B.

The goal of our ransom identification framework is to distinguish ransom payments from the set of all transactions to SCL . A. Data Validation Foremost, we designed and implemented our identification We realize that it is difficult to both comprehensively framework to be precise -- we wanted to identify ransom measure SCL 's economy and precisely identify all ransom payments with a high degree of confidence and minimize the payments to SCL beyond a reasonable doubt. In turn, the number of extraneous transactions included in our dataset. stringent transaction value and timestamp parameters used in Second, we built our framework to be lightweight -- rather our ransom identification framework provide a lower bound than querying the entire Bitcoin blockchain, we chose a semi- estimate of ransom payments and SCL 's economy. To gauge automatic approach to crawl and parse transactions to SCL how conservative our previous estimates are using the aforemenusing the Blockchain API [14]. For each address in SCL , points tioned framework, we take three different measurements with of interest included the total number of transactions, total sent varying transaction value and timestamp parameters. The three and received bitcoins, and the number of ransom payments measurement methods are as follows: Method 1) transactions to received. For each transaction, we were interested in input SCL without any transaction value or timestamp filters, Method and output addresses, bitcoins transferred, and timestamps (in 2) transactions to SCL filtered only by transaction values, and UNIX epoch time).

Fig. 3. The plots show longitudinal trends in the value of ransom payments to SCL from September 2013 through January 2014. We compare data yielded by our identification framework to two other measurements detailed in Section III-B.

This is important because filtering by ransom bitcoin's exchange rate. In Figure 4, we show a valuation amounts is a relatively strong and straightforward heuristic, in US dollars of the CryptoLocker economy throughout its whereas filtering by time intervals is an invariably weaker operational period. We can see our estimate of $310,472.38 with heuristic. This is because the date that a ransom is paid is the assumption that the CryptoLocker threat actors cashed out dependent on the date that an individual's system is infected ransom proceeds at the end of each day ("daily cash in"). In the and the 72-hour payment window, so it is entirely possible "cumulative cash in" curve, we assume that the CryptoLocker that a system could have been infected by an older version threat actors aggregated the bitcoins collected from ransom of CryptoLocker demanding an outdated ransom. We consider payments, and we perform a valuation commensurate with these anomalous ransom payments and omit these transactions the USD/BTC exchange rate on each day. Based on the by choosing Method 3 for the purpose of maintaining reliable latter assumption, we estimate that the peak valuation of and precise data for analyzing trends in ransom payments in the CryptoLocker economy occurred on November 29, 2013 Section V. when they had collected a total of 1,044.13 BTC worth upwards of $1.18 million. The USD/BTC exchange rate also reached its peak on that day at $1,332.26/BTC. This estimate B. CryptoLocker Economy in Bitcoin is corroborated by the valuation of CryptoLocker provided Using Method 3, we identify 795 ransom payments to by Spagnuolo et al. at $1.1 million taken on December 15, SCL , which contribute a total of 1,128.40 extorted bitcoins. 2013 [7]. Using daily bitcoin to USD exchange rates, we estimate It is difficult to accurately measure or visualize the rate of that these ransom payments valued $310,472.38. However, CryptoLocker infections from Figure 3 due to the changing as we mentioned before these figures are conservative and the ransom demands and exchange rates for bitcoins, so we payouts to SCL may have been as much as 1,541.39 BTC and construct a time series plot showing the frequency of ransom $539,080.69 based on Method 1, though we cannot be certain payments to SCL throughout CryptoLocker's operational period. that the unaccounted transactions are ransom payments. From Figure 5, we begin to see low levels of activity starting Since the exchange rates for bitcoins were quite volatile on September 9, 2013 when the first ransom9 of 1.99 BTC is throughout the months of CryptoLocker's operation, the value 9 https://blockchain.info/tx/33208314/ of these extorted bitcoins would have seen a meteoric increase

paid to SCL . On October 8, 2013 through October 11, 2013, we see a sharp increase in ransom payments (27, 21, 37, and 29, respectively), which is consistent with our knowledge on CryptoLocker's use of the spam botnet Gameover ZeuS starting on October 7, 2013 [13]. As a result, we see that the original ransom of 2 BTC constituted 422 of the 795 identified ransoms and nearly half of the total transaction volume in US dollars. This was undoubtedly CryptoLocker's most prolific period in terms of successful infections. Over the next two months, we see undulating periods of activity which leads us to believe that CryptoLocker may have been distributed in several batches throughout its operation. SCL experiences a significant decline in ransom payments starting in mid-December of 2013 and eventually comes to a close by the end of January 2014; we are not aware of any further CryptoLocker addresses after this period. V. DATA A NALYSIS Our goal is to gain insight on CryptoLocker's targets and changes in targets throughout its operation by statistically determining distinct distributions in the times of day that different ransom types (i.e. 2 BTC, 1 BTC) were paid to SCL . We achieve this by performing Kolmogorov-Smirnov (goodness of fit) tests on ransom payment timestamps to

determine whether different ransom types come from different populations in Section V-A. We analyze these trends and explain our findings in Section V-B. A. Kolmogorov-Smirnov Tests The Kolmogorov-Smirnov test for goodness of fit is based on the maximum difference between either an empirical and a hypothetical cumulative distribution (one-sample) or two empirical cumulative distributions (two-sample) [15], [16]. For our study, we use two-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests to determine, using ransom payment timestamps, whether or not samples from different ransom types come from different parent populations at the 99.5% confidence level. Our sample populations include 2 BTC, 1 BTC, 0.5 BTC, 0.3 BTC, and 0.6 BTC ransoms, but exclude 10 BTC (Late) and 2 BTC (Late) ransoms, because we do not have sufficient sample sizes. We provide metadata on each type of ransom in Table II. We begin by stating the null hypotheses of our KolmogorovSmirnov tests: fn1 (x) and fn2 (x) are samples of two empirical cumulative distribution functions f1 (x) and f2 (x), and that H0 : f1 (x) = f2 (x) -   x  + (1)

The alternative hypotheses are that H1 : f1 (x) = f2 (x) -   x  + (2)

Analysis of Timestamp Data

Before we go into detail on the time series and density plots in Figure 6 and a statistical summary of time distributions in Table III, we put into perspective a hypothetical time distribution that CryptoLocker victims from the United States We then compute empirical cumulative distribution functions, paid primarily in bitcoin (which we know to be false from f1 (x) and f2 (x), from the two samples. To compute the test the CryptoLocker study by CTU researchers [11]). What we statistic D from f1 (x) and f2 (x), we find the maximum do know is that CryptoLocker targeted business professionals, absolute difference over all values of x given by so we would expect ransom payments to be transacted during D = max|Fn1 (x) - Fn2 (x)| (3) typical working hours, or at the very least, during the daytime. x Let us assume a typical 9:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. working day After computing D for all permutations of our sample pop- for business professionals in the United States. In Pacific Time ulations, we compute critical values, Dcrit , at the 99.5% (PT, UTC-08:00), 9:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. would correspond to confidence level for each permutation given by 17:00 UTC to 1:00 UTC on the following day. In Eastern Time (ET, UTC-05:00), 9:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. would correspond to Dcrit = 1.73 (n1 + n2 )/n1 n2 (4) 14:00 UTC to 22:00 UTC. Based on Figure 6 and Table III,

Fig. 7. The table compares the test statistic D and the critical value Dcrit for all permutations of ransom types. If D > Dcrit , we may reject the null hypothesis and assume that the samples come from two different parent populations at the 99.5% confidence level. These are shown in red.

the only sample that could follow such a distribution is the 1 BTC sample, however, we cannot conclude that 1 BTC ransom payments were primarily paid by victims from the United States without further evidence. Because we have no reason to believe that the marginal number of CryptoLocker victims in the United States who opted to pay using bitcoin would choose to pay in the nighttime, we assume that ransoms paid to SCL came from outside of the United States. From our Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests, we find that the timestamp sample of 2 BTC ransoms differs from samples of 1 BTC and 0.3 BTC ransoms. Additionally, we find that the sample of 1 BTC ransoms differs from the sample of 0.3 BTC ransoms. Thus, we know that all three samples come from different populations at the 99.5% confidence level. In the 2 BTC sample, the median time of payment is 13:55:06 UTC with an interquartile range (Q3 - Q1 ) of 09:05:24 hours. From the density curve in Figure 6, we see that it has a unimodal distribution, which suggests that a large portion of ransom payments during this time came from the same region. Referring back to the CTU researchers' study, we see that from October 22, 2013 to November 1, 2013, they measure 1,767 infections from Great Britain, which has the second highest percentage of total global infections (5.5%) after the United States (70.2%). If we use our rough 9:00 a.m.­5 p.m. "working day conjecture", we would expect ransom payments from Great Britain (GMT, UTC±00:00) to be concentrated between 9:00 UTC and 17:00 UTC. This is consistent with the first and third quartiles from the 2 BTC sample (08:55:20 UTC and 18:01:00 UTC), but again, we make no solid claims without further evidence. Turning to the 1 BTC sample, the median time of payment is 17:07:49 UTC with an interquartile range of 07:00:20 hours. We see that it also has a unimodal distribution and restate that the distribution of timestamps from this sample roughly models what we would expect if a majority of these ransoms were paid from the United States. Next, we take a look at the 0.3 BTC sample, which has a median time of payment of 11:33:30 and an interquartile range of 13:13:18. We see that the large spread can be attributed to the 0.3 BTC sample's bimodal probability distribution, which suggests that the ransom sample came from two distinct sources. One of these sources closely resembles the time distribution from our 2 BTC sample, which we imputed to ransom payments from Great Britain. The second source of ransoms in early December falls between a 6-hour time interval from 23:00 UTC to 5:00 UTC on the following day. Referring back to the CTU researchers' study, from December 9, 2013 to December 13, 2013, their measurements show that CryptoLocker infections become more dispersed with 23.8% from the United States, 19.0% from Great Britain, and 12.9% from Australia. We continue to see CryptoLocker infections in Great Britain, which is consistent with one of the peaks in the bimodal 0.3 BTC sample. If we convert the time interval from 23:00 UTC to 5:00 UTC using our "working day conjecture" and set 23:00 UTC as 9:00 a.m., we would expect these ransoms to come from time zones with an offset of UTC+10:00. This corresponds to the Australian Eastern Time Zone, which is,

Fig. 8. A visualization of outgoing bitcoin transactions from the CryptoLocker cluster, SCL , network. Based on Louvain Modularity for community detection, we distinguish 17 distinct sub-communities in the SCL network. We see that the ransom balances from all addresses within a community are transferred to a single aggregate address at the center. We group several sub-communities together based on shared addresses and the times they were active (i.e. Community 1, or c1 ) and identify eight communities of interest (c1 through c8 ).

again, consistent with measurements by the CTU researchers' CryptoLocker study, however we make no solid claims that a large portion of the 0.3 BTC ransoms undoubtedly came from Australia. VI. F INANCIAL I NFRASTRUCTURE We next turn to understanding CryptoLocker's financial infrastructure by analyzing communities in the CryptoLocker cluster, SCL . We begin by overviewing SCL 's topology in Section VI-A. Examining SCL at a lower level, we impute realworld data found on various online fora and Bitcoin services to distinct communities in Sections VI-B to VI-C. We find connections to BTC-e and Bitcoin Fog and speculations to the Sheep Marketplace scam and other bitcoin cybercrime. A. Transaction Graph To better understand CryptoLocker's financial infrastructure, we use Gephi10 , an open source software for network visualization and exploration, to visualize outgoing transactions from SCL (Figure 8). In total, the network contains 993 nodes (addresses) and 1,020 weighted (by BTC), directed edges, which delineate one or more transactions between two addresses. The 993 addresses in the network are comprised of 968 addresses from SCL and 25 additional addresses that are recipients of outgoing transactions from SCL , which we

Examining the transaction history of Asheep1 , 3) Community 4: We next take a look at c4 , which is we find that it has a balance of 50,000 BTC on November 16, comprised of 110 addresses.

On the same day, the aggregate address transfers discontinued use after transferring its balance to aggregate its balance into a multi-input transaction of 1,000 BTC to addresses, we speculate that Aseed1 's anomalous 0.0002 BTC the Sheep Marketplace's secondary money laundering address, may have been part of the Sheep scam.

This indicates that Aseed1 's anomalous transactions of 400 BTC, 500 BTC, and 300 BTC, which are transaction is not an isolated incident and we use this finding also sent to Sheep's secondary address, Asheep2 . as a point interest for other CryptoLocker addresses. 2) Community 1: While canonical communities c2 through C.

considering how rapidly the cybercrime landscape is changing, there will be circumstances in which we, as researchers, do not possess substantial evidence on nascent cybercrimes. In this regard, we may use some of the techniques discussed in our study to form a rudimentary understanding on these new schemes.

We have performed an in-depth, measurement analysis on CryptoLocker's economy and financial infrastructure. Initially, from two seed CryptoLocker addresses gathered from online fora, we generate a cluster of 968 addresses belonging to the CryptoLocker enterprise. From there, we identify and quantify ransoms paid (in bitcoin) by victims and produce an estimate upwards of $310,472.38 in financial damages. Based on our analysis of ransom timestamps, we form conjectures on regions where CryptoLocker infections were prevalent from trends in the times that ransom payments were made and compare our findings with other studies on CryptoLocker. Finally, we visualize the CryptoLocker operation's underlying financial infrastructure and analyze the topology in a modular fashion. We find subtle links between CryptoLocker, the Sheep Marketplace heist, and other Bitcoin cybercrime schemes. Our findings suggest that Bitcoin cybercrime may be much more interconnected than originally considered and that further analysis could uncover and confirm any existing relationships in the underground cybercrime landscape. Given the increased prevalance of ransomware in the cybercrime landscape as of late, we believe that our study may enable further research in longitudinally measuring the evolution, economies, and strategies of ransomware criminal enterprises. We plan to further develop our heuristics for identifying ransom transactions from the Bitcoin blockchain in order to comprehensively measure the economies of CryptoLocker, as well as newer families of ransomware, and better understand their underlying financial infrastructures and money laundering strategies.
