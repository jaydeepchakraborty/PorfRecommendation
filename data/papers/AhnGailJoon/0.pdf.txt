A six-year analysis of 12 multilingual online marketplaces focuses on underground commerce, including
stolen user data, fake identities, and attacking tools and services. Migration trends, items for sale, and
seller and buyer characteristics reveal commonalities among these fraudulent markets.

R

esearchers have dissected and analyzed many technologies designed to facilitate cybercrime, such as
malware and botnets, and have proposed and deployed
countermeasures against such technologies. However,
studying the economy behind these technologies and
campaigns is imperative for obtaining a holistic view of
cybercrime. The majority of research examining online
underground markets considers small samples of mostly
English-language markets; few studies have systematically examined or compared multiple markets over long
periods of time (see the “Related Work in Online Market Analysis” sidebar).
To remedy this, we collected multilingual online
underground marketplace data from 12 market forums
between December 2005 and July 2011 and systematically examined and compared them to gain a deeper
understanding of cybercrime.

Forums and Data Overview

We first discovered three English-language forums
through Google using common terms in stolen data
markets, including “carding,” “dump,” “purchase,” “sale,”
32

and “CVV” (card verification value).1 By exploring the
contents of the Russian Speaking Carder subforum of
these three English-language forums, we discovered
three Russian-language forums via user-shared links. We
found the other six forums in the same way—by analyzing the posts in the previously discovered forums. These
12 forums were geared toward commerce, whereas most
previously studied forums were designed for computer
hackers to communicate and share.
Most of the 12 marketplace forums were publicly
accessible without registration. A few were available
only for registered users. To access these, we created a
separate username for each forum but didn’t interact
with other registered users.
We don’t claim the data we have is complete; in fact,
we analyzed only certain subforums highly related to
cybercrime. For each forum, we gathered data that a
registered user would see, such as posts, replies, number
of posts from a specific user, and so on. We didn’t collect private data that was available only to specific users
or administrators, such as private messages and banned
user logs. The data was in HTML format and more than

o peek into the understudied cybercrime economy, some
groups have studied specific underground economy cases,
such as keyloggers and spam campaigns; others have examined
online marketplaces that rent, sell, and distribute malware, botnet,
stolen user data, illegal services, and so forth. However, few published studies on cybercrime markets actually assess the pricing
structures for data and services. Even though “Exploring Stolen
Data Markets Online: Products and Market Forces” and “Examining the Risk Reduction Strategies of Actors in Online Criminal
Markets” touch on the subject, few papers have systematically
examined or compared multiple marketplaces communicating
in different languages over long periods of time.1,2 As a result,
it’s difficult to assess the scope of harm that cybercrime markets
cause, whether they operate on the open Web or Internet relay
chat (IRC). The 12 forums in our study were all geared toward
commerce, whereas most forums analyzed in previous literature
on underground society were designed for computer hackers to
communicate and share.1,3–7. For instance, “Examining the Social
Networks of Malware Writers and Hackers” explored the social
networks of a group of Russian hackers to understand the nature
of relationships and the ways that they affect information sharing
and action. “SocialImpact: Systematic Analysis of Underground
Social Dynamics” modeled online underground social dynamics by considering both social relationships and user-generated
contents and systematically quantified social impacts of individuals and groups.
Our study also differs from studies on Silk Road, a fraudulent market that focused on illegal and controlled substances.8 The forums

6 Gbytes in size. Some of the forum webpages contained direct evidence of financial and computer-aided
crime, whereas others contained conversations related
to such suspicious activities.

Data Preprocessing Methodology
Manual analysis of this large volume of data is tedious
and difficult; therefore, we chose a semiautomated
approach by developing programs and scripts that were
guided by our initial manual analysis. Then, we manually investigated and verified the extracted results.
After acquiring the forum webpages, we used
freshly designed parsers and our in-house social analysis tool to perform preprocessing.2 Our parsers automatically went through all the collected HTML pages
and identified and extracted basic information such
as each thread’s title, date information, usernames,
and post contents. Even though the input HTML
format differed among forums, our parsers output
­well-formatted information and stored it in a database.

in our dataset were fraught with threads that were highly related to
financial crimes, identity fraud, and other suspicious activities.

Our in-house tool then took over and went through all
the webpages stored in the database, using a language
detection tool to determine the posts’ languages. Posts
that weren’t in English were translated using a language
translation tool. Our in-house tool computed the most
active and influential users in the dataset and visualized
their social dynamics.
To understand our marketplaces, we first automatically
identified selling and buying posts. For selling posts, we
used four criteria, classifying a post as a selling post when
the first and at least one other criterion were satisfied:
■■ At least one word related to selling appeared in the post.
Such words include “sell,” “offer,” “sale,” “give,” “trade,”
“vendor,” “dealer,” “merchant,” and their derivatives.
■■ The post’s length was sufficiently long (more than 150
characters). We used this feature because sellers usually provide product information, which invariably
made their posts quite long.
■■ The words “ICQ” or “PM” appeared in this post.

Sellers usually provided their ICQ (an IM program)
numbers or asked to use private message (PM) for
further communications.
■■ At least one word related to money was present.
Examples include a dollar sign, “webmoney,” “wm,”
“roubles,” “cash,” and “wallet.”
Buying posts had to meet the following two criteria:
■■ At least one word related to buying appeared in
the post. Such words include “buy,” “seek,” “look,”
“search,” “purchase,” and their derivatives.
■■ The post was short (less than 150 characters).
Our tool’s search engine component indexed all
original and translated text in webpages. Given one or
more keywords, our tool returned the webpages, posts,
and users related to such words. By building programs
and scripts on top of our in-house tool, we were able to
perform more sophisticated analysis on the original and
translated data.
During an initial manual analysis of our dataset, we
noticed that a substantial volume of valuable information resided in nontextual resources, so we also analyzed images and flashes in this dataset. To make this
analysis scalable, our tool first went through all folders
in our dataset and extracted unique images (based on
their hash values) larger than 20 Kbytes. This resulted in
fewer than 1,000 unique GIF and JPEG files. We manually went through these images to choose the ones that
pertained to commerce. After this process, we ended up
34

with fewer than 100 images. A Russian translator helped
us understand the content on those images.

Domain Names, Whois Records,
and IP Addresses
In addition to the previous data, we acquired the Whois
records and IP address histories of the 12 domain names
while the forums were active. Our funding agencies
requested that we not publish the domain names publicly. Such information would provide unique insights
into where these underground forums were registered
and hosted and how they migrated from country to
country during their lifetime. Table 1 summarizes each
forum’s basic information, including registrant country,
IP locations, and registration and expiration dates, and
Table 2 shows the data we collected from each forum,
including its subforums; dates analyzed; and number of
threads, posts, and users.
Forum1 was an English-language forum dedicated
to trading credit cards and other financial information.
It was registered in November 2011 by a person who
lived in Russia for a year. During that year, the forum
had 10 different IP addresses that indicate that the
server migrated across six countries. Forum1 data contains 56 threads from the Market subforum, generated
by 86 users.
Forum2 was an English-language forum that had a
Russian-language carders subforum. Its domain name
was registered through privacyprotect.org, which
acts as a registrant proxy and obfuscates the real registrants’ identities. Therefore, we don’t know how

migrated across five countries.
Forum5 was a Russian-language website and forum
that was active at the time of this writing. Its Whois

2004 to April 2015, and was hosted in England. Forum5
data belongs mainly to the subforum Flea market.
Forum6 was an active Russian-language website and
forum that reported crime-related news. It also had a
registration record of 11 years, from December 2004
to December 2015, and was hosted in Sweden. Its data
mainly belongs to the subforum Banks, Auction.
Forum7 was an active English-language forum with
a Russian-language carders subforum. Its domain name
was registered through several privacy-reserving proxies, including privacyprotect.org. Forum7 data covers
December 2010 to July 2011 in the Russian-language
carders subforum.
Forum8 was an English forum with a subforum
called Verified services only, which was further divided
into many subforums, each of which focused on one
area, such as bank drops and botnet, viruses, or exploits.
Forum8 acted like a “one-stop shop” where users could
find a variety of services. Our Forum8 data includes
user-generated content from 727 users.
Forum9 was an active Russian-language hacker
forum. The records indicate that it was registered by
someone living in Ukraine, and its server was located in
Germany. The domain name was registered from April
2009 to April 2015. We have data from its Buy/Sell and
Job subforums.
Forum10 was a Russian-language hacker forum with
a Payment systems subforum under Hacking & Security. We have data posted by 320 users from April 2007
to March 2011.
Forum11 was an active Russian-language hacker
forum. Its registration record is obfuscated. We have
the posts from subforums Trojans and keyloggers,
Scanners and rest, and SEO/Financial Objectives—all
­subforums of Ack Software.
Forum12 is a live Russian-language hacker forum
that has a popular carding subforum and Fraud Sell/
Buy/Exchange subforum with more than 700 posts and
800 users. The domain name was registered through
privacyprotect.org.
In summary, five out of the 12 forums were out of
service at the time of writing. According to our Whois
and IP address information, these five forums changed
their IP addresses many times during their life cycles. All
five forums provided few features apart from discussion
boards on selling and buying. Their Whois registration
records also show relatively short registration periods
that could indicate that the administrators planned to
run these forums and domain names for a short period
of time. These forums might have been reincarnated
through new domain names.
On the other hand, most of the active forums
were part of a larger website. Even though evidence of
36	

IEEE Security & Privacy

financial and computer-aided crime can be found in
these forums, their parent websites host legitimate news
articles and blogs. Their Whois records also show that
their domain names were registered for up to 11 years.
We assume such websites weren’t designed merely for
underground commerce; however, the communities
built around them participate in suspicious activities.

Marketplace Analysis

Here, we present analysis results on the marketplaces,
describing representative goods, seller and buyer characteristics, popular payment methods, and some persistent advertisements.

Goods
Common goods sold in underground markets include
dumps, skimmers, identities, attack tools, and mules.
Dumps. Dumps comprise stolen credit card or bank

account numbers and associated customer data;1,3 they
were the most popular goods for sale in our 12 marketplaces. Using our semiautomatic approach, we found
1,781 dumps sellers in this dataset. The prices for dumps
ranged from US$6 for a standard American credit card
to $200 for a corporate Canadian corporate card.
We found dumps all over the world including Europe,
Asia, the Middle East, Canada, and the US. Some had
service code 101 or 201, which means the cards could
be used internationally with a normal authorization
process and no restrictions on merchant type. Some
dumps had both International Air Transport Association track 1 data, which contains the cardholder’s name
as well as account number and other discretionary data,
and American Banking Association (ABA) track 2 data,
which contains the cardholder’s account, encrypted
PIN, plus other discretionary data. Some had only
track 2 data, for which sellers often offered free tools to
extract track 1 data.
There were some dumps with track 2 data and customer names. Dumps were sold either with or without
PINs and CVVs. Buyers sometimes left feedback on
sellers and helped other buyers to decide where to buy.
Examples include, “Bought 43 dumps with bonuses …
90% HIT OVER 2K AMAZING!” It’s hard to estimate
the amount of dumps in these markets of the sellers’ revenue, but most sellers claimed to update dumps every
day. Even though most sellers didn’t broadcast how they
acquired these dumps, one post, as shown in Figure 1a,
says the dumps were stolen with skimmers.

Skimmers. Users could buy skimmers for many types of
ATMs (such as Wincor, NCR, and Diebold Opteva);
prices ranged from $425 to $6,000 for a skimmer and its
accessories. Our tool identified 17 posts selling skimmers.

Figure 1. Dumps and skimmers. (a) A post selling dumps. The title implies the dumps were obtained by skimming. (b) A
post selling skimmers. The presented skimmer cost US$5,000 and claimed to work on NCR ATMs. The original post was in
English and Russian.

Figure 1b shows such a selling post in which the
seller promoted Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM) skimmer for NCR ATMs. The seller
advertised that this skimmer could be installed in less
than six minutes, including the time for removing NCR
ATMs’ green antiskimming solution.
Identities. Identity-related goods were popular in our
marketplaces. Figure 2a shows the identity-related
items a user can buy from these markets. The left column shows a fake Russian passport, Israeli passport, and
Russian driver’s license. The middle column shows a
fake Russian ID with a hologram that the seller claimed
could “pass tests.” A Russian-speaking seller created
these fake IDs and charged 5,000 rubles apiece. This
seller claimed to provide customized fake IDs within
days. The right column shows several fake holograms,
which resembled the Russian Federation’s coat of arms.
English-speaking sellers also provided fake IDs.
For example, we found an English-speaking seller who
claimed to provide fully swipeable and scannable IDs
with correct hologram and ultraviolet display. This
person claimed to have holograms of Florida, Rhode
Island, New Jersey, Illinois, and Pennsylvania (with
UV) in stock and asked for $1 per hologram for orders
of less than 200 IDs. The price dropped to $0.50 per
hologram for orders over 500.
Attacking tools and services. The marketplaces were

fraught with attacking tools and services. For example,

www.computer.org/security

89 posts were selling distributed denial-of-service
(DDoS) tools and services. Figure 2b shows such a post
wherein the seller sold DDoS attacks for $50 per night.
The seller claimed the DDoS service had been verified by three markets, including Forum4, and sold the
Optima botnets as well.
An April 2011 post was selling the famous bankbot
Carberp, including links to a video of the tool. The seller
asked 2,500 WMZ (WebMoney transfer title unit that’s
equivalent to US dollars) for a version with loader and
grabber, 5,000 WMZ for a version with backconnect
and the ability to inject Internet Explorer and Firefox,
and 8,000 WMZ for a version with Virtual Network
Computing (VNC)-like remote control. Other attack
tools in the market were the PickPockeT botnet, Katrin
exploits pack for rent, webinjects for Zeus/Spyeye, and
a black hole exploits kit.
Mules. Four posts were either selling or buying mules.

The buyers posted the destinations for which they
needed muling services; however, it’s unclear which
goods they were trying to move.

Sellers and Buyers
We were interested in whether sellers were as well connected as buyers and other users. Because no explicit
social networks were defined in these forums, it was
impossible to retrieve users’ buddy lists or contacts,
as we can in Facebook or LinkedIn. Instead, we generated the connections between users based on the visible

represent users’ social connectivity in each category.
As Table 3 shows, we identified the number of sellers,
buyers, other users, and their CPUs in each forum using
the aforementioned criteria. There were a total of 2,121
buyers and 3,165 sellers. On average, sellers had 8.2
contacts and buyers had 9.4, whereas users who weren’t
classified as a seller or a buyer had 13.4 contacts on average. We conducted two-sample t-tests (with the significance level set at 5 percent) to determine whether the
two user groups differed in terms of number and type
of contacts. We found that the buyers and sellers didn’t
significantly differ in number of contacts (p = 0.127, H0
accepted at a 5 percent significance level). However,
buyers and sellers did significantly differ from unclassified users in terms of number of contacts (p < 0.001, H0
rejected at a 5 percent significance level).
Manual verification reveals two reasons behind this
phenomenon. First, the selling and buying posts possibly triggered fewer replies than other types of threads.
We suspect that selling and buying transactions were
moved to private channels, such as PM or ICQ, soon
after an initial advertisement or solicitation, as research
has shown that private communications are frequently
used rather than overt purchases on the forums.1,4,5
However, other types of posts, such as discussion of
recent news, would receive more comments. Second,
sellers and buyers preferred to keep a low profile and
weren’t seen participating in other threads as much as
other users.
www.computer.org/security

We classified the 3,165 sellers into dumps sellers and
other types of sellers. There were 1,781 dump sellers
in the 12 forums, as Table 4 shows, which is more than
other sellers in total.
We were interested in whether dumps sellers’ posts
generated more discussions in public than other sellers’ posts. Although dumps sellers did dominate all
products sold, other resources were needed to facilitate
actual thefts. Thus, feedback is invaluable to assess their
quality. We used replies per user to represent the average
number of comments that users in a category receive.
We conducted a two-sample t-tests to determine
whether dump sellers’ posts received equal replies to
other sellers’ posts. No significant difference was found
between the groups in number of replies per user (p =
0.085, H0 accepted at a 5 percent significance level).
We analyzed the number of overlapping usernames
across all pairs of marketplaces. The results show these
forums didn’t share many users, with most pairs of forums
having less than 5 percent overlapping usernames. However, 57 percent of Forum2 users were also members of
Forum7, and 18.9 percent of Forum7 users were members of Forum2. Besides user overlap, we were also interested in seller overlap across all pairs of marketplaces. By
comparing the seller usernames, we found that most of
the overlapping usernames belonged to sellers. In the
66 market pairs, the shared usernames from five pairs all
belonged to sellers. In addition, 21 market pairs had more
than 50 percent of shared users acting as sellers.

Payment Methods
We identified several payment methods mentioned
in these forums and counted their occurrence in each
forum. Manual analysis revealed that most buyers
and sellers mentioned acceptable payment methods,
whereas in some cases, sellers were trying to sell credentials of those payment methods.
We differentiated the number of times a payment
method appeared in original posts and the number of
times it appeared in replies. This is because our manual
analysis revealed that a payment method’s appearance
in an original post was an indicator for buyers or sellers
to regard it as an acceptable financial channel to make
transactions. And, its appearances in the replies might
have been due to discussions and queries. However,
we don’t have transaction data to show the actual use
of any payment method. We use original post–to–all
posts ratio (OAR)—that is, the number of times a payment method appeared in an original post divided by
the number of times it showed in all posts—as a metric
to denote how often a method appeared in an original
post. The higher the OAR, the more likely the payment
method was acceptable for buyers and sellers.
Table 5 shows our database’s most popular payment
methods. WebMoney was mentioned the most and had
a 66.3 percent OAR. Yandex was the second most popular with 1,247 occurrences and a 55.3 percent OAR.
Liberty Reserve, a Costa Rica–based digital currency,
was mentioned the third most times. Liberty Reserve,
which was shut down by law enforcement agencies in
May 2013 for money laundering, was mentioned 702

times and had a 26.3 percent OAR. Western Union
and PayPal were mentioned 669 times and 530 times,
respectively. E-gold—a digital gold currency operated
by Gold & Silver Reserve located in Florida—appeared
179 times and had a 64.2 percent OAR. E-gold was shut
down by the US government around 2008.
Most studies capture only a few months of data at a
time, which limits the assessment of preferred payment
types to what’s popular during that period. Even though
E-gold is no longer used, it’s still found in our sample
due to the fact that some posts were made when it was
in circulation. Nowadays, Bitcoin is the dominant anonymous online payment system.6 However, there were
only 6.5 million bitcoins in circulation among an estimated 10,000 users as of June 2011, compared to 12.5
million bitcoins and more than 6.5 million users today.7,8
In our dataset, Bitcoin was mentioned only 43 times in
total, and its OAR was significantly lower than average.

Persistent Advertisements
The marketplaces featured some persistent advertisements, which were placed as banner images using GIF
files or flashes. These ads weren’t posted by forum users
but by website administrators. The most common were
dump ads, shown in Figure 3a. These ads, both in English and Russian, usually had contact information—
either ICQ numbers or email addresses.
Black markets also advertised on other black markets
to attract more visitors. We found two ads for Forum2
and Forum1 in Forum4 and Forum11, respectively.
Recall that Forum11 was still running at the time of
May/June 2016

Based on the length of its lifetime, we suspect Forum11
has a reputation in this community and attracts new
markets to promote on it.

Discussion

Although this analysis provides an important overview
of the practices of cybercrime markets, it’s necessary
to recognize our data’s limitations. First, the forums in
this study were accessible during December 2005 to
July 2011 without using an anonymity network. Some
were even indexed by commercial search engines, such
as Google. Evidence suggests that more popular underground forums aren’t open to the public and require
vetting by known members to gain access.9 Second, the
forum data we collected comprises only posts made in
the forum threads, rather than PM exchanges between
users. Third, we don’t have users’ payment transaction data, which is important for understanding actual
money movement. This kind of data might be available
only from collaborations with financial sectors.
Despite these limitations, publicly accessible forums
provide an entry point in the underground cybercrime
marketplace, which many low-skilled hackers might use
to engage in illegal activity.1,4 The services available and
price points might differ from those of more hidden communities, although there is some evidence that a proportion of the vendors operating in this sample had solid
www.computer.org/security

reputations and engaged in transactions across multiple
forums to increase their prominence underground. As
such, this analysis demonstrates that sellers in these markets have some degree of complexity and sophistication,
even though the communities aren’t closed or vetted.

A

nalysis of our marketplace dataset led to several
key findings. First, the domain names and websites dedicated to black markets had shorter lifespans,
and their website servers migrated among multiple
countries in their lifetimes. Second, most goods sold
in these marketplaces included dumps, identity-related
documents and services, and attacking tools and services. Third, sellers and buyers had fewer contacts in
public threads than other users. Their posts triggered
fewer replies, and they were less likely to participate
in others’ threads. Fourth, there were more dump sellers than other kinds of sellers. Fifth, dump sellers did
not receive more feedback than other forms of sellers
in public threads. And finally, even though many pairs
of marketplaces didn’t share many users, most of the
shared users were sellers.
