Game Context and Methods. We designed Saving Lake Wingra, a 10-day game-based learning curriculum
for argumentation based on the situated argumentation design framework. The curriculum aims at
restructuring classroom discourse for argumentation through three phases. The first phase (days 1- 4) aims
at reconditioning classroom discourse patterns from a usually teacher-centered and turn-taking pattern to a
student-centered, dialogic, and collaborative format. The second phase (days 5-8) engages students in
extended practices of dialogic and collaborative arguments as teams of three professionals. In the last phase
(days 9-10), students present arguments collaboratively and individually to argue for the best interest of
Lake Wingra.
Data Results and Significance. The results indicate that all three middle school students participating in this
study were socially and intellectually engaged in practicing and developing arguments about the future of
Lake Wingra. Some constructed claims with supporting evidence and even countered claims proposed by
peers, though the degree to which each participant was able to argue differed. Role-playing and open-ended
knowledge representation empowered students to express personal opinions supported by evidence. The
findings suggest that (1) conceptual understanding plays a key role in constructing evidence-based claims
and (2) the situated argumentation design framework can be improved by foregrounding the importance of
conceptual understanding in constructing arguments.

Virtual Environment-based Assessments of Science Content and Inquiry:

Research Goals and Theoretical Framework. The SAVE Science project is focused on creating,
implementing, and evaluating assessment modules designed to capture evolving patterns of scientific
understanding among middle-school students based on data collected from their interactions in a virtual
environment. In this presentation, we report on findings from implementations of our first assessment
module. In particular, we focus on how the module can reveal misconceptions held by students about
scientific phenomena, and describe student perceptions of virtual environment-based activities designed
primarily as assessments rather than as learning environments.
Game Context and Methods. In SAVE Science, students try to uncover likely contributors to a host of
problems facing a virtual world. To accomplish this, students must apply knowledge and skills studied in
their classroom-based science curricula through multiple assessment quests over the course of a school
year. We are looking to see if learning outcomes on district and state assessments by learners in SAVE
Science differ from those in control classes not participating in the project. The module in the current study
assessing understanding of adaptations and structure/function asks students to investigate possible causes
for poor survivability among a flock of sheep recently moved to the farm from a far-distant (and
environmentally distinct) location. In completing the assessment task, students can interact with two
computer-based characters (a farmer and his brother). For healthy indigenous or failing new sheep, students
can measure legs, bodies, and can access weight, age, and gender data.
Data and Results. This presentation will focus on results from our pilot and first year of implementations.
We conducted our pilot in spring 2009 with nineteen 7th grade science students who participated in the first
SAVE Science assessment module, assessing understanding of adaptation of organisms to a local
environment. Automatically collected data lends insight to student actions and understanding. For example,
all students gathered data before reaching conclusions, indicating that students understand the concept of
evidence-based inferences. Some students asked questions of the two non-player characters multiple times,
and all observed sheep characteristics. Further, students used their observations to support their responses
to questions from the farmer. The data also helped illustrate student misconceptions of inference versus
observation and other science concepts. At the same time, students in the pilot study noted a strong sense
of engagement while completing the assessment module activities. One student said, “[I] like how the
people talk. [I] like the sound. [I] like how you can move yourself around. [IT’S] MORE FUN THAN A
REGULAR TEST.” This student’s sensory experience in the virtual world made for an enjoyable, effective

learning experience.
Significance. Initial analysis indicates that we are able to differentiate between students who understood
and used the appropriate methods in their inquiry from those with had misconceptions about the content or
inquiry processes. Further, and perhaps not surprisingly, we found that students perceived the assessments
as engaging and game-like (rather than stressful and test-like). The findings, while tentative, provided
useful information for the redesign of the first assessment module that we are now implementing in
multiple classrooms.

GameBuilder: Does Reduced Software Complexity Allow More Time on
Task?
Eric Klopfer, Chuan Zhang, Judy Perry, Josh Sheldon; Massachusetts Institute of Technology
Research Goals and Theoretical Framework. To allow for greater student engagement and learning as a
result of involvement with augmented reality (AR) games, several programs are underway in which
students, not teachers or researchers, develop their own AR games. Previous tools for developing AR
games had very complex user interfaces. As a result, the team developed GameBuilder, an AR editor with a
much simpler interface, under the assumption that such a tool would allow for more focus on the game to
be built and learning components to be included in the game. This research is designed to test that
assumption.
Game Context and Methods. A protocol was developed to test the abilities of middle-school aged children
to engage with the game design and content of their games, as opposed to spending effort managing the
software. Participants were randomly assigned to two groups, one that would use the more complicated AR
game editor, and one that would use GameBuilder. Each group was asked to complete a tutorial on using
the assigned software, and then asked to build a simple game, with a topic of their own choosing, using that
software. A researcher observed each study participant through both the tutorial and the free design session,
and participants were then asked to rate their satisfaction with the software and the experience overall.
Data Results and Significance. Results from the free-design period and surveys show that participants were
equally able to use the two pieces of software to develop their own games, after completing the tutorial. It
is interesting to note, however, that participants using the more complex game editor, which had a number
of features in which they were not trained, did not take advantage of any of these more advanced features.
In addition, though the surveys did not reflect any additional dissatisfaction with the tool, the researcher
observing use of the more complex software saw that in a number of cases, users inadvertently opened
parts of the software they did not mean to and were distracted for some period of time trying to get back to
their planned task. This suggests that the simplified interface is beneficial. Further research should test the
ability of users to complete basic tasks without the benefit of the initial tutorial.

MUVEs and Meta-Knowledge
Jody Clarke-Midura & Eugenia Garduno, Harvard University
Research Goals and Theoretical Framework. Numerous researchers have emphasized the role of
metacognitive processes in inquiry learning (White & Frederiksen, 1998, 2005; Kuhn, Black, Keselman, &
Kaplan, 2000; Kempler, 2006; Kuhn & Pease, 2008). As an example, White et al offer a framework for
inquiry learning, the meta-knowledge framework, which contains four primary processes: theorizing,
questioning and hypothesizing, investigating, analyzing and synthesizing (White & Frederiksen, 1998;
White, Frederiksen, Collins, in press). As part of this framework, they claim there is a meta-processing
level where one evaluates not only what process should be carried out but how well it is being carried out.
Similarly, research on games and multi-user virtual environments (MUVEs) suggest curricula delivered via
these technologies have the potential to offer more authentic science inquiry learning that reflect the
processes in White et als framework (Gee, 2003; Dede, 2009, Clark et al, 2009). We are studying how
curricula delivered via immersive technologies have the potential to create learning experiences that (1)
allow for authentic inquiry learning (2) enable metacognitive processes laid out by White et al. The
research questions we will address in this poster are: what aspects of learning influence students’

Abstract— We investigate the impact of data placement on two
Big Data technologies, Spark and SciDB, with a use case from
Earth Science where data arrays are multidimensional.
Simultaneously, this investigation provides an opportunity to
evaluate the performance of the technologies involved. Two
datastores, HDFS and Cassandra, are used with Spark for our
comparison. It is found that Spark with Cassandra performs
better than with HDFS, but SciDB performs better yet than
Spark with either datastore. The investigation also underscores
the value of having data aligned for the most common analysis
scenarios in advance on a shared nothing architecture.
Otherwise, repartitioning needs to be carried out on the fly,
degrading overall performance.

INTRODUCTION

Several Big Data technologies based on shared-nothing
architecture (SNA) [12] offer cautious hope to scientists
facing the daunting challenge of analyzing datasets of
unprecedented volumes in the Big Data era. Among SNA’s
important advantages are: 1) it provides a simpler
distributed programming model better suited for data
parallelism than that of traditional network programming
such as MPI; 2) it can take advantage of relatively
inexpensive commodity hardware; and 3) it supports
redundancy and resiliency resulting in better system
availability (long system uptime).
A very common category of analysis in Earth Science is
comparing values of the same geophysical variable obtained
by different means. These comparisons may involve
observations from different instruments or observations and
model results that require binary operations such as join.
While parallel database systems, e.g. Vertica or Oracle, are
especially adept at such operations and facilitate various
data analysis tasks, developing analytic capabilities in these
systems is generally too arduous for Earth scientists. More
recent frameworks, however, provide simple, yet powerful,

high-level abstractions and tools that make it possible for
various types of users to work with data efficiently without
detailed knowledge of the underlying implementation.
SciDB is one such recent technology development that
specifically targets multidimensional arrays, providing an
attractive alternative to general purpose analytic platforms
such as Hadoop/MapReduce [1] or Spark [17], for scientific
data analysis. As a next-generation parallel database system
based on the array data model, SciDB not only indexes the
data it ingests for fast retrieval, but also provides an
attractive, mathematical/statistical toolbox for data analysis.
Similar to Spark and Hadoop/MapReduce, SciDB also
exploits the affinity of compute and data, with arguably
better effectiveness.
In this study, we compare two technologies that are
designed with different analytic purposes in mind, Spark
and SciDB, in the aspects of 1) performance 2) flexibility,
and 3) impact of data placement using a typical use case in
Earth science. In Spark, we also explore an alternative
datastore to HDFS, i.e. Cassandra. We first highlight the
needs and requirements for high-level distributed computing
systems in Section II. We describe our use case scenarios
next in section III, and then present our evaluation in
Section IV. We conclude the paper with a discussion and
our plan for future works.
II.

DATA INTENSIVE APPLICATIONS IN EARTH SCIENCE

A. Shared Nothing Computing Frameworks
Since the publication of MapReduce (MR) [1], data
scientists and technologists have tried to adapt and extend it
to many data analysis applications in various domains.
Hadoop (HD), the open-source version of MapReduce, has
thus become the default choice for almost every Big-Data
analysis application. But, its sub-optimal performance has
been noted in a number of scenarios [3, 4]. Recent
technological developments, such as SciDB and Spark, are

providing attractive alternatives to Hadoop/MapReduce
(HD/MR) for scientific data analysis.
While HD/MR is simple and arguably laudable for onepass computations, it is inherently inefficient for multi-pass
algorithms. The reason for this is that HD/MR lacks
appropriate primitives for sharing intermediate states of the
calculation between passes and instead sends/retrieves
intermediate states to/from a distributed file system. The
overhead from communication and I/O of this approach
often dominates overall performance. For this reason,
HD/MR is poor for complex applications and algorithms
that are typically composed of simpler calculations, which
in-and-of-themselves are well-suited to HD/MR. SciDB, on
the other hand, not only indexes the data it ingests for fast
extraction and retrieval, but also provides an attractive,
mathematical/statistical toolbox for data analysis. Like
HD/MR, SciDB exploits the affinity of compute and data.
One of the primary disadvantages of Spark, compared to
a full DBMS solution such as SciDB, is its loose coupling
between the datastore and the execution framework. While
Spark provides several primitives for efficient data
manipulation such as sharing and partitioning, we can
leverage these primitives only after data are loaded into
Spark’s execution engine. Therefore, Spark cannot directly
exploit regularities in structured data. Instead, it must
effectively “rediscover” such structure every time data are
accessed, leading to a certain degree of unavoidable
overhead. Fortunately, there are datastore systems, such as
Cassandra, that allow better integration with Spark into a
semi-DBMS solution.
Cassandra is an in-memory, “distributed storage system
for managing large amount of structured data spread out
across commodity servers, while providing highly available
service with no single point of failure” [20]. Cassandra
implements column datastore that ensures data locality for
its partitions. A partition in Cassandra, however, may be
split across multiple files locally and data locality within a
partition is not guaranteed. That is, it may need to read
multiple local files in order to arrive at the specific rows or
columns of interest. This has pertinence in analytic
processing because, unlike SciDB (also using column store),
operations requiring the full list of attributes or columns
(such as projection in SciDB) may not be optimal.
B. Multidimensional Arrays
Scientists typically work with multidimensional arrays.
An array can be thought of as a grid of cells, such as that of
a numerical weather prediction model, which is often
multidimensional and each array cell often contains multiple
attributes, e.g. pressure, temperature, humidity, etc. A cell of
this more abstract array, hitherto referred to simply as
“array”, is filled, if all of its attributes are present and valid,
or empty if all of its attributes are absent or invalid,
otherwise it is partially filled.
There have been efforts to build array data processing on
top of table-based RDBMS, but the process of translating

342

array-specific operations to RDBMS’ primitives is
nontrivial, and such efforts generally fail to exploit effective
multidimensional partitioning and indexing [9]. In contrast,
array-oriented systems such as SciDB directly manipulates
multidimensional arrays and supports many array operations
out-of-the-box with efficiency.
Finding an optimal strategy for indexing arrays has been
a major focus of existing works on multidimensional array
data. The standard approach is to partition an array into
“chunks”, each of which typically resides on a node in a
cluster and can be considered as a unit of work for parallel
processing [9]. Selection of partitioning, or chunking,
heuristics is important as they affect the efficiency of the
storage system.
There are two basic chunking approaches: regular and irregular [9]. Regular chunking (REG) partitions the array
cells into uniform chunks regardless whether they are filled
or empty, whereas irregular chunking (IRR) may partition
them into different sizes, where each chunk often holds
roughly the same number of filled array cells to even the
workload of an operation over nodes and achieve better
overall performance. One advantage of REG is its
amortization of seek times and any fixed-costs associated
with processing a chunk, but IRR can avoid straddling over
skewed data, which occurs often with sparse arrays [9].
More complex chunking approaches can be derived from
these basic ones, such as REG-REG, where each chunk of
the array is subdivided into smaller regular chunks that can
be used to efficiently determine the relevant set of data for
an operation, or IRR-REG where each chunk of roughly the
same data volume of the array is partitioned into smaller,
equally spaced chunks to take advantages of the regular
chunking scheme. Sparse arrays, often unevenly distributed
in their coordinate space and thus poorly skewed, are
particularly hard to partition for efficient parallel
processing.
Existing works have shown that the majority of Earth
Science data, where the natural dimensions are time,
latitude, and longitude, are sparse arrays in the
spatiotemporal coordinate space. Moreover, data often
exhibits irregular spatial pattern over time, further
complicating the situation. Although it is possible to create a
denser array by using only the temporal dimension for
indexing, this causes inefficiency in other array operations,
such as aggregation operations over spatial areas (aggregate
value grouped by spatial subsets). Upon consideration, we
choose the REG-REG chunking scheme for Spark in this
study, because our arrays are dense and it has been reported
to be optimal for various types of array processing workload
[8]. For fairness sake, a similar regular chunking scheme is
also used in SciDB.
C. Importance of Data Layout
Queries on multidimensional arrays typically involve
scan, dicing, join and overlap operations [9]. Array scans,

such as filter, processes all chunks of an array. Array
dicing, such as subsample, may involve a subset of an
array. While array scans and subsamples are trivial to
parallelize because they operate on each chunk
independently, it is more efficient if only relevant chunks
are processed. Binary operations, such as join and
merge, can get more complex depending on the join
predicate [9,15]. But what is critical to efficient binary
operators is that the same logical chunks from both input
arrays are co-located on the same instances, which avoids
computationally expensive repartitioning to align the
corresponding pairs of chunks. Overlaps, such as clustering
or connected component labeling, is difficult to implement
efficiently and its implementation details often depends on
the problem at hand [16].
The queries in this paper focus on scan and binary
operations. Our goal is to evaluate the performance
characteristics the selected technological approaches. As
mentioned previously, performance of binary operations can
vary, depending on how corresponding arrays are initially
partitioned. Evaluations are carried out for both scenarios:
When the arrays are aligned and mis-aligned for a join
operation. Alignment of arrays requires not only they have
the same shape, i.e. same dimensionality and same range in
each dimension, but also the same partition configuration. In
SciDB, the same array schema ensures both and guarantees
that corresponding chunks physically reside on the same
node, or aligned.
D. Multidimensional arrays in Spark/HDFS and
Spark/Cassandra
Since Hadoop distributed file system (HDFS)
automatically determines the physical placements of the
HDFS blocks of a file, in order to have a fairer evaluation of
these two dissimilar analytic systems, we first generate a
sequence file for the pair of aligned arrays, a step that
resembles the re-dimensioning and chunking operation in
SciDB. A “chunk” so-emulated is represented as a keyvalue pair, where its key is the coordinate space of the
chunk and its value holds the data inside each chunk of the
compatible arrays. This endows Spark+HDFS with the
similar advantage of chunk co-location as that in SciDB.
With a column datastore such as Cassandra, however,
co-location of data records with similar keys is possible.
Because Cassandra consistently hashes a user-defined
partitioning key, if we use the coordinate space of chunks as
partitioning key, aligned arrays can have their chunks
distributed in similar ways in the cluster. We implement
each array in Cassandra as a table, whose dimension ranges
of a chunk are partition keys, and each row encapsulate data
for a chunk, whose attribute is a column with its value being
a binary representation of data for this attribute within this
chunk.

USE CASE DESCRIPTION

In order to study the performance characteristics
between SciDB and Spark, we use a concrete set of typical
queries in Earth Science domain. The queries operate on 2
multidimensional datasets described below.
A. Datasets
Two regularly gridded datasets for the period of Winter
2010, i.e. from 1 December 2009 to 28 February 2010, are
used to conduct our experiments. The first one is extracted
from hourly datasets of the NASA Modern Era
Retrospective-analysis for Research and Applications
(MERRA) [22] data collection and the second from
National Mosaic and Multi-sensor QPE (NMQ, where QPE
stands for quantitative precipitation estimate) [23].
MERRA has global coverage, whereas NMQ is only
available for the contiguous United States (CONUS),
specifically 20°N-55°N in latitude and 130°W–60°W in
longitude. They are also of different resolutions. For
MERRA it is ⅔°×½° (longitude×latitude) in space and
hourly in time, whereas it is 0.01°×0.01° in space and every
5 minutes in time for NMQ. Therefore, homogenization of
these datasets is the necessary first step of our data
placement experiment.
In the preparation of the MERRA array, we first
resample the original MERRA array in the longitude
direction to ½° equivalent and then replicate the resampled
array by a factor of 5×5 for each ½°×½° grid cell in space,
from which a CONUS subset is extracted. The CONUS
subset is subsequently replicated 12× in time. The resultant
MERRA array effectively mimics 0.1°×0.1° resolution in
space and 5-min in time. Accordingly, we perform a 10×10
average in space for the NMQ array, bringing its resolution
down to 0.1°×0.1° in space and 5-min in time as well. After
the homogenization, both arrays have array dimensions of
700×350 in space and 25,920 (=12×24×90) in time, i.e. the
same shape.
B. Regridding queries
One of the typical queries that Earth scientists perform
on spatiotemporal data is averaging over predefined
intervals in each dimension. Similar queries are used in this
case to homogenize the two arrays to the same shape. In
SciDB, a query can be written in Array Query Language
(AQL) and/or Array Functional Language (AFL) [21]. We
use AFL in our SciDB queries. (AFL code for the queries
can be obtained from us upon request.)
Q1. Resample MERRA array to 0.1°, in both latitude and
longitude, and 5-minute resolution.
Q2. Average NMQ array also to 0.1° and 5-minute
resolution.

Table 1. Average running time of queries for 5-day data on 3-node cluster (in minutes).

Q1 selects the total precipitation attribute (PRECTOT)
first. The outer xgrid-regrid-xgrid operations transform
MERRA into the 0.1° and 5-minute resolution. Similarly,
Q2 changes the original NMQ array into the same resolution
as that of MERRA.
C. Comparison queries
Another common type of operations in earth science is
comparing the values of the same geophysical quantity (in
this case, precipitation) obtained with different means.
Q3. Repartition resampled MERRA array on the fly to
compare precipitation rates with coarsened NMQ
array.
Q4. Repartition to align resampled MERRA with coarsened
NMQ array.
Q5. Compare precipitation rates using aligned arrays.
The purpose of Q3 is to find the difference in
precipitation rates between corresponding cells of the 2
arrays. Since the arrays’ placements are not aligned,
repartitioning of one array (in this case the MERRA array)
to align with the corresponding chunks of the other is
necessary, which is done via repart in SciDB. Since
SciDB partitions intermediate arrays of queries and offline
arrays in similar manner, only 1 array needs to be
repartitioned. In Spark, however, this is not possible unless
the coarsened NMQ array has been previously repartitioned
by Spark itself.
Q4 and Q5 attempt to study the effect of placement
alignment by aligning the arrays in advance. Q4 saves the
results of the alignment operation of Q3 and Q5 performs
the join operation in order to calculate the difference in
precipitation rates between each pair of corresponding cells.
Since Spark does not have a similar high-level query
language as SciDB, we have to implement our own. In
implementing these queries we strive to use operators that
are as similar as possible to the data flow pattern of SciDB.
Spark code for the queries are also available upon request.
We describe our computing environment and report
evaluation results of the evaluation experiments in the next
section.

PERFORMANCE EVALUATION EXPERIMENTS AND
RESULTS

A. Computing Environment
Two virtual clusters, one with 3 nodes and the other 28
nodes, are set up to carry out our experiments. Each node
resides on a separate, unique physical container. All the
nodes have the same features: 32 GB of main memory (or
random access memory, RAM), an 8-core CPU, and ~16 TB
of local spinning disk storage and they all run Centos 6.5
Linux operating system. The nodes are interconnected with
Infiniband (Mellanox MT27500 FDR IB).
We use the enterprise edition of SciDB release 15.7,
which supports replication and advanced linear algebra
operations, such as singular value decomposition (SVD),
that are not available in the community edition. As to Spark,
version 1.6 of the Cloudera CDH5.4.2 distribution is used.
To ensure fairness of the comparison, all the technological
approaches are configured on and use the same clusters.
The HDFS configuration employs a replication factor of
2 and 3, respectively, on the 3-node and 28-node clusters.
The same replication factors are used for SciDB as well on
respective clusters. However, performance numbers are also
obtained for SciDB with no replication (equivalent to
replication factor of 1) because the community version of
SciDB does not offer replication. For the Spark+Cassandra
integration, we use Datastax Cassandra version 3.07.1159
with MurmurHashPartitioning strategy. We also configure
Cassandra to have the same replication factors as those used
with HDFS on the respective clusters. Finally, our Spark’s
implementation of the array models is written in Java.
For all technological approaches, we configure as much
as possible to have the same resources for utilization. For
example, each Spark job is executed with 2 8GB, 4-core
executors. Similarly, there are 2 SciDB instances running on
each node. Each query is repeated three (3) times for each
technological approach and on each cluster. The averaged
performance of the 3 runs are reported below. The timing
variation of the 3 runs is always around only few percent.
B. Evaluation

for different configurations of our clusters on the queries

mentioned above. Since the data volume of the entire 3month is too much for the 3-node cluster, a 5-day subset is
used instead. The 28-node cluster, however, operates on the
entire 3-month (or 90-day) datasets.
There are two operators available for joining operations
in SciDB: cross-join and join. The former, i.e.
cross-join, is a generic join operator that makes no
assumptions about the schemas of the array operands, while
the latter, i.e. join, requires the array operands to be
aligned (i.e. corresponding chunks co-located on the same
nodes). The performances of both are reported for SciDB.
Spark, however, does not have similar options.
Table 1 tabulates the average running times (in minutes)
of the queries on the 3-node cluster. Best performing
number in each query is boldfaced in the table.
Spark+HDFS is consistently the worst performer. This
aligns well with our earlier discussion regarding
Spark+HDFS that it does not leverage resident memory as
SciDB or Spark+Cassandra does. Spark+Cassandra
performs the best only in Q1. SciDB is consistently the best
performer. For Q2, SciDB (both with or without replication)
is ~50% faster than the next best, Spark+Cassandra.
However, it is curious that SciDB with 2× replication is
significantly slower than without replication on crossjoin for both Q3 and Q5. We currently have no good
explanation to this. The most striking result is perhaps the
efficiency of SciDB join operator, which offers 3 to 5 times
the speed than that of the otherwise best performer, i.e.
SciDB cross-join, in Q3 and Q5.
The performance advantage of SciDB is even more
apparent on the 28-node cluster, for which Table 2 tabulates
the timing results. Unsurprisingly, Spark+HDFS is still the
worst performer. Both SciDB configurations, i.e. with or
without replication, beats Spark+Cassandra in all 5 queries,
often with wide margins. However, while the performance
advantage margin of SciDB over Spark-based approaches
has narrowed for Q2, it has grown for Q3 and Q5 on
cross-join. More interestingly, we do not see the large
disparity between the two SciDB configurations on
cross-join in Q3 and Q5 anymore. SciDB join still
offers the best performance and considerable advantage over
cross-join.
To compare how the technological approaches scale
from 3 nodes to 28 nodes, roughly an order of magnitude,
we compute the following ratio as a measure for scalability:
(t3/5/3)/(t28/90/28),

345

where t3 and t28 are performance times of the 3-node and 28node clusters, respectively. Basically, it is the ratio of the 3node performance time to 28-node performance time, after
both have been normalized by the data volume (number of
days) and number of nodes. Larger ratios thus correspond to
better scalability. The results of this comparison are
tabulated in Table 3, with the best performer of each query
boldfaced as before. It is apparent that SciDB is still the best
overall performer in scalability. SciDB without replication
scales better for join, whereas SciDB with replication
scales better for cross-join. Spark+HDFS breaks its
losing streak by having the highest ratio in Q2. However,
due to limited computing resources available to us, we are
unable to perform scalability comparisons to larger clusters
up to, more realistically, thousands or even tens of
thousands of computing nodes. The results presented here
therefore should not be considered conclusive.

DISCUSSION AND FUTURE WORKS

Our experiments have demonstrated the potential of an
array-based DBMS system, SciDB, particularly for the
Earth Science domain. In most of the experiments, SciDB
yields better performance than general analytic systems such
as Spark, and provides more convenient, mature analytic
toolbox for working with multidimensional arrays. It is
worth noting here that SciDB aims at end users who are
interested in using high-level queries rather than in
developing complex analytic algorithms. SciDB also
appears to scale better. In addition, we have demonstrated
that array data processing can be built on top of general
purpose analytic systems such as Spark, with respectable
efficiency.
Based on the evidence presented, we conclude that best
performance is achieved when data placements are aligned
for the query because it eliminates the need for
computational expensive repartition operation. For a Big
Data analysis system, however, it is impossible to have data
placements aligned for all possible queries. Therefore, to
reap the greatest benefit and attain the greatest value, the
Big Data analysis system should align data placements for
the most common and frequent queries.
In Earth Science, analysis scenarios predominantly
require spatiotemporal coincidence. For example, when
investigating precipitation events or systems, we almost
always need the environment conditions for the same
location and same time (i.e. spatiotemporal coincidence) of
the events or systems. Unfortunately, this simple concept of
data placement alignment presents a formidable challenge in

models exists for representing Earth Science data. One of
our research goals is thus to find and identify an effective
indexing scheme that 1) can be applied to, preferably, all
data models, 2) supports data placement alignment, and 2)
exerts little or no negative impact on data analysis
performance, all at the same time. Our research indicates
that Hierarchical Triangular Mesh (HTM) [24] is a
promising approach that meets the requirements. The
evaluation of HTM performance in various Earth Science
data analysis scenarios is thus an important component of
our future efforts.

Exploring Embedded Guidance and Self-efficacy in Educational Multiuser Virtual Environments

Abstract: In this paper, we present the results of an exploratory study into the relationship
between student self-efficacy and guidance use in a Multi-User Virtual Environment (MUVE)
science curriculum project. We examine findings from a group of middle school science students
on the combined effects on learning of student self-efficacy in science and use of individualized
guidance messages. In addition, we report on findings that demonstrate the interplay between
levels of self efficacy in science and use of an embedded guidance system in an educational
MUVE.

Problem
In this paper, we describe a study probing the possible relationship between students’ guidance use in an
educational multi-user virtual environment (MUVE) and their self-efficacy in science, as well as the combined
impact on learning of guidance use and self-efficacy level in an educational MUVE designed to teach scientific
inquiry skills and experimental design to middle school students.
Our study centers on the River City graphical MUVE. In River City, small teams of students develop and
test hypotheses about why residents of the town are ill. During a 12 session curriculum, students experience a year
of virtual time in River City. Students first gather information over the course of four seasons in River City. This is
followed by classroom-based experimental design group work. Students then re-enter River City to test their
hypothesis in “control” and “experimental” worlds, which differ by one factor chosen by each team based on its
experimental design. Students then write to the town mayor describing their hypothesis, experimental design, and
results (Nelson, Ketelhut, Clarke, Bowman, & Dede, 2005).
Self-efficacy in scientific inquiry refers to a student’s belief that they can conduct scientific inquiry; it is a
measure of their confidence in conducting inquiry activities. Researchers have investigated both the origin of a
person’s self-efficacy and its effect on behavior. Of particular interest to this study is whether there is a relationship
between self-efficacy and accessing guidance. Evidence for this relationship is equivocal with studies showing
widely divergent results regarding whether high or low self-efficacy students are more likely to show help-seeking
behaviors and whether this behavior is beneficial for learning or not (Pajares, 2004).
To explore the relationship between science self-efficacy and guidance use in River City, an embedded
guidance system was added to the MUVE. The system monitors student activities to display text-based hints
designed to assist them in understanding data found in the MUVE.
Use of the guidance system in River City relies on students’ willingness to make use of it. Consequently, it
is likely that use of the embedded guidance reflects the research on self-regulated learning and thus indicates that
students with high self-efficacy would be more likely to access the guidance messages than students with low selfefficacy in science.

Research Questions
1.
2.

The research questions in this study are:
Do students with low self-efficacy in science view fewer guidance messages within a MUVE-based science
curriculum than students with high self-efficacy in science?
Do students with low self-efficacy in science who view guidance messages within a MUVE-based science
curriculum perform as well on content tests as students who report high self-efficacy in science?

Population
This study presents results of a 2004 implementation with 102 seventh-grade students who were provided
access to embedded guidance in the River City MUVE.

Procedures
Students had access to a guidance system featuring continuously updated links to hints. Students could
view three hints per pre-defined information object in River City. Whenever students clicked on a specially tagged
object inside the MUVE, the guidance system flashed alternating colors to signal that new hints were available. To
view messages, students clicked on the hint buttons, allowing us to track when students viewed guidance messages
and which messages they saw.

Measures
Qualitative and quantitative data were collected. Pre- and post-intervention, students completed an
affective measure adapted from three surveys; Self-Efficacy in Technology and Science (Ketelhut, 2005), Patterns
for Adaptive Learning Survey (Midgley, 2000), and the Test of Science Related Attitudes (Fraser, 1981). To assess
science inquiry skills and biology knowledge, we administered a 30 question content test, pre- and post-intervention
with an internal consistency reliability of .80 in a middle school population.
Students’ self-efficacy in scientific inquiry was measured using a subscale in the affective measure
containing 12 items, each rated on a scale from 1 (low) to 5 (high) (Ketelhut, 2005). Overall scores are computed by
averaging the student’s responses across the twelve subscale items, with high scores representing high self-efficacy.
The measure has an estimated internal consistency reliability of .86.

Findings
In answer to our first research question, we found that students with low initial self-efficacy in scientific
inquiry viewed significantly fewer guidance messages (p<.05) than their higher self-efficacy peers. For example, a
student with an initial self-efficacy score of 1 would view approximately 14 fewer messages on average than a
student with a self-efficacy score of 3. In addition, it was found that boys viewed significantly fewer messages than
girls (p<.05) overall, and across a range of initial science self efficacy scores (p<.05).
To assess the second research question, we first regressed student post-test scores on levels of guidance
system use and pre-test scores. In this analysis, we found that viewing guidance had a significant positive impact on
post-test scores (p<.01). In other words, holding pre-test scores constant, students who viewed more guidance
messages out-performed students who viewed less. To investigate whether low self-efficacy students who viewed
guidance performed as well as students with higher self-efficacy, we added initial level of self-efficacy in science to
our model. We discovered that self-efficacy also predicted for post-test content scores in a model with guidance
views (p<.05).

Conclusion
This exploratory study indicated that (a) students with low self-efficacy in science view fewer guidance
messages embedded in an educational MUVE than students with higher self-efficacy, and (b) students who view
more guidance messages outperform those who view fewer, with high self-efficacy students outperforming lower
self-efficacy students across a spectrum of guidance use. With well-designed educational MUVE-based curricula
incorporating embedded guidance and engaging inquiry, we hope that all learners can better understand and apply
principles of real-world science inquiry.

This study investigates the potential of a digital game that overlays popular game-play mechanics with
formal physics representations and terminology to support explicit learning and exploration of Newtonian mechanics. The analysis compares test data, survey data, and observational data collected during
implementations in Taiwan and the United States with students in grades 7–9. Results demonstrate
learning on some core disciplinary measures and high levels of learner engagement, indicating the
potential beneﬁts of this genre of conceptually-integrated games, but also suggesting that further
research and development will be needed to more fully harness this potential. Encouragingly, striking
similarities were observed across the two countries in terms of learning and engagement, suggesting that
this genre of learning games may prove suitable for engaging students in active exploration of core
science concepts across multiple countries.

1. Introduction
International and national science standards call for inquiry learning and a focus on depth of understanding, but science instruction in
many countries often focuses more on breadth than depth and involves minimal opportunity for inquiry-related learning (e.g., Mullis,
Martin, & Foy, 2008; Newton, Driver, & Osborne, 1999; Roth et al., 2006). Furthermore, school-based science curricula tend to center on
explicit formalized knowledge structures, seldom connecting this knowledge with students’ tacit intuitive understandings. Digital games
potentially provide a medium for addressing these challenges in an engaging inquiry-based manner for students (Gee, 2003, 2004, 2007;
Klopfer, Osterweil, & Salen, 2009). A growing body of research and scholarship on games and cognition emphasizes cycles of prediction,
observation, and reﬁnement as core mechanics of game play processes (e.g., de Freitas & Neumann, 2009; Salen & Zimmerman, 2003; Squire
et al., 2003; Wright, 2006). Prediction and observation are focal inquiry processes in science education (e.g., Champagne, Klopfer, &
Gunstone, 1982; Tao & Gunstone, 1999), and thus digital games might support students in exploring challenging core science concepts in
a context that also emphasizes key inquiry processes rather than the decontextualized rote learning central to much traditional science
instruction. Prior studies have suggested, however, that learning in digital games is often more tacit than explicit (e.g., Squire, Barnett, Grant,
Higginbotham, 2004). Furthermore, there may be differences between students in different countries that would preclude implementing
a generalized approach to learning within a digital game across multiple contexts (e.g., Lee & Luykx, 2007). The current study explores these
two challenges. More speciﬁcally, the current study explores the two following questions:

1. Can a conceptually-integrated digital game that overlays popular game-play mechanics with formal physics representations and
terminology support explicit learning about Newtonian mechanics as demonstrated through post-test measures based on assessment
items from the formal discipline (i.e., the Force Concept Inventory)?
2. How similar or different are the learning and affective experiences of students playing the game in two different countries (i.e., Taiwan
and the United States)?
2. Background
The idea that games might provide affordances for science learning and inquiry is not idiosyncratic. In 2006, the Federation of American
Scientists issued a widely publicized report stating their belief that games offer a powerful new tool to support education and encouraging
governmental and private organizational support for expanded funded research into the application of complex gaming environments for
learning (FAS, 2006). In 2009, a special issue of Science (Hines, Jasny, & Merris, 2009) echoed and expanded this call. Many studies provide
evidence for the potential of digital games to support science proﬁciency in terms of conceptual understanding and process skills to operate
on that understanding (e.g., Annetta, Minogue, Holmes, & Cheng, 2009; Barab et al., 2007; Clark, Nelson, Sengupta, & D’Angelo, 2009; Coller
& Scott, 2009; D’Angelo, Clark, Nelson, Slack, & Menekse, 2009; Dieterle, 2009; Hickey, Ingram-Goble, & Jameson, 2009; Holbert, 2009; Kafai,
Quintero, & Feldon, 2010; Ketelhut, Dede, Clarke, & Nelson, 2006; Klopfer, Scheintaub, Huang, Wendal & Roque, 2009; Moreno & Mayer,
2000, 2004; Nelson, 2007; Nelson, Ketelhut, Clarke, Bowman, & Dede, 2005; Steinkuehler & Duncan, 2008). Studies also show that
games can support students’ epistemological understanding of nature and development of science knowledge (e.g., Barab, Sadler, Heiselt,
Hickey & Zuiker, 2007; Clarke & Dede, 2005; Neulight, Kafai, Kao, Foley, & Galas, 2007; Squire & Jan, 2007; Squire & Klopfer, 2007) and
students’ attitudes, identity, and habits of mind in terms of their willingness to engage and participate productively in scientiﬁc practices
and discourse (e.g., Anderson & Barnett, in press; Annetta et al., 2009; Barab, Arici & Jackson, 2005; Barab et al., 2009; Dede & Ketelhut, 2003;
Galas, 2006; McQuiggan, Rowe, & Lester, 2008).
2.1. Leveraging popular game-play mechanics to teach physics
Many popular commercial games offer interesting pedagogical opportunities for physics education with their focus on physics-based
problem solving that involves careful manipulation force and motion. Speciﬁc titles of note in this genre have included, for example,
Portal, Marble Madness, Marble Blast, Orbz, Tiger Woods PGA, Switchball, and Mario Galaxy (see examples in Fig. 1).
While these commercial physics games provide students with a strong intuitive ‘feel’ for physics concepts, they don’t appear to (and were
not designed to) help students make the leap from tacit understanding to more formalized knowledge. For example, Masson, Bub, and
Lalonde (2011) found that students playing a commercially available physics-based game (Enigmo) “improved their ability to generate
realistic trajectories” (p. 1). However, the game did not help them learn more from a direct instruction “tutorial” when compared to a control
group. The tutorial focused explicitly on formalized concepts and “explain[ing] the forces acting on moving objects and objects at rest”, but
the game itself gives the students an idea about what trajectories look like and some information about angles of incidence vs. reﬂection.
This mismatch between the content and experience in the game and the expected learning could be one reason for the limited gains.
Game-based experiences thus appear to require scaffolding in order for students to make the connections between the game and the
more formalized knowledge required in a school-based context. These ﬁndings suggest that simply having players engage with physicsbased games is not sufﬁcient to help them learn physics. This result is not overly surprising; few people would suggest that playing
soccer, for example, will teach people physics even though soccer is clearly a physics-based game in many ways. Enigmo was developed as
a commercial recreational game rather than as a learning experience, and thus unsurprisingly follows along this path. Soccer, Enigmo, and
other games, however, could potentially be re-envisioned or redesigned in a manner that would support explicit articulation and exploration of the core physics implicit in their game experience.
2.2. Designing physics games for learning
While most research on games for science learning has focused on 3D virtual worlds that players explore to collect and analyze data to
form and test hypotheses (e.g., Barab et al., 2009; Ketelhut et al., 2006; Ketelhut & Schifter, 2010), some research has focused on building the
learning goals into the actual movement and mechanics of the fabric of the world using popular game-play mechanics from the genre of
physics games discussed above (Clark, & Martinez-Garza, in press; Clark, Nelson, D’Angelo, Slack, & Martinez-Garza, 2010; Clark, Nelson,
D’Angelo, Slack, Menekse, et al., 2010; Nelson, Erlandson, & Denham, 2010). Clark and Martinez-Garza label these latter games as

Fig. 1. Tiger Woods PGA (2006), Orbz (2004), and Mario Galaxy (2007) all involve physics puzzles as their core game mechanic.

2180

“conceptually-integrated” and the former games as “conceptually-embedded” to distinguish between the approaches. Essentially,
conceptually-integrated games have the potential advantage of engaging the player with the science ideas targeted in the game a higher
percentage of the play time (potentially the vast majority of play time) whereas conceptually-embedded games involve other interactions
while moving and exploring the world between speciﬁc inquiry locations and activities, or as backdrop for those activities. The disadvantage
of integrating the science learning goals directly within the motion and mechanics of the game world, however, is that while the players may
spend the vast majority of game-play time interacting with the core ideas as a means of navigating through the world, making the core ideas
and relationships explicit rather than tacit is a much bigger challenge than in the conceptually-embedded approach. The challenge for
conceptually-integrated games therefore focuses on helping players articulate connections between the tacit ideas they develop with the
explicit formal concepts and representations.
Examples of conceptually-integrated games include Supercharged (Anderson and Barnett, in press; Barnett, Squire, Higginbotham, &
Grant, 2004; Jenkins, Squire, & Tan, 2004; Squire, Barnett, Grant, Higginbotham, 2004), SURGE (Clark, Nelson, D’Angelo, Slack, &
Martinez-Garza, 2010; Clark, Nelson, D’Angelo, Slack, Menekse, et al., 2010; Clark et al., 2009; D’Angelo, 2010; D’Angelo et al.,2009;
Nelson et al., 2010), and FormulaT Racing (Holbert & Wilensky, 2010). Supercharged, for example, is a 3D game in which players utilize
and explore the properties of charged particles and ﬁeld lines to navigate their ship through space. The player’s spaceship is moved through
the game world by taking advantage of the properties of charged particles in the space. Three middle school classes participated in a mixed
methods pilot study comparing learning outcomes of students playing Supercharged (n ¼ 35) and those using a guided inquiry in-class
curriculum (n ¼ 61). Average post-test scores were signiﬁcantly higher (p < .05) for the students who played Supercharged. The test
included 12 questions on electromagnetism combined with pre-post interviews of a random sub-set of the students that were then
transformed into additional quantitative data (Squire, Barnett, Grant, Higginbotham, 2004). This learning was only possible, however, when
the teacher collaborating in the research created activity structures outside of the game to engage students in predicting and explaining
what was happening in the game and reﬂecting on connections of the tacit intuitive knowledge that the students were building through
game play to the representations and concepts of the formal discipline.
Holbert (2009) further documented the intuitive knowledge used and developed through commercial games with game mechanics
compatible with the conceptually-integrated approach. He coded observational data of talk and gestures collected during ethnographic
observations of and individual clinical interviews with children playing popular video games (Mario Kart Wii and Burnout Paradise). Holbert
identiﬁed that children’s intuitive schema of velocity, acceleration, and momentum were at play while they were playing these games. These
schemas have been previously identiﬁed as registrations (Roschelle, 1991) and phenomenological primitives (p-prims) (diSessa, 1993), and
have been shown to play productive roles in the development of understanding of physics.
How can we leverage these intuitive understandings within conceptually-integrated games? Research on the success of certain simulations suggests that conceptually-integrated games focusing on force and have potential for learning (e.g., Klopfer & Purushotma, in press).
These conceptually-integrated physics games involve close structural relationships with simulations. These games utilize accurate physics
engines and engage students in exploring underlying concepts by having them vary parameters and observe the resulting outcomes of those
choices in terms of changes to the trajectories of objects modeled by the engine. Research on simulations has shown that they can provide
leverage in terms of harnessing a user’s spatial learning and perceptual systems in ways that text and verbal interactions do not (Lindgren &
Schwartz, 2009). Strong evidence suggests that various types of simulations (and thus potentially digital games) used in conjunction with
appropriate curricula and instruction can foster aspects of scientiﬁc expertise such as model-based reasoning, systems-thinking,
construction of scientiﬁc explanations, and other conceptual skills and understanding (e.g., Edelson, Gordin, & Pea, 1999; Edelson,
Salierno, Matese, Pitts, & Sherin, 2002; Harel & Papert, 1991; Papert, 1980; Raghavan & Glaser, 1995; Roschelle & Teasley, 1995; White,
1993; White & Frederiksen, 1998; Wieman, Adams, & Perkins, 2008). Just as in games, however, research on simulations suggests that
students may use trial-and-error as opposed to mindful strategies (Chang, Quintana, & Krajcik, 2010) or focus on heuristics rather than deep
learning (Turkle, 1997).
While this research suggests that conceptually-integrated physics games could potentially support learning while engaging players in
important inquiry processes, the research also suggests that creating a design that does not result in shallow learning while also not
destroying the ﬂow and “game-ness” of the game may prove challenging. More speciﬁcally, how might we bridge and scaffold the rich tacit
understandings developed during game play with explicit formalized understandings? In Thought and Language, Vygotsky (1986) discusses
the potential for leveraging intuitive understandings from everyday experience (“spontaneous concepts”) with instructed scientiﬁc
concepts to build robust understandings. The question remains whether or not the intuitive spontaneous concepts developed in games can
actually be successfully leveraged into robust instructed concepts in the format and terminology of academic assessment and across
domains recognized as central by the scientiﬁc disciplines. The current study explores the potential of overlaying popular game-play
mechanics with formal representations and terminology in an attempt to bridge the tacit understandings from game play with the
formalized explicit academic understandings.
Research Question 1. Can a conceptually-integrated digital game that overlays popular game-play mechanics with formal physics
representations and terminology support explicit learning about Newtonian mechanics as demonstrated through post-test measures based
on assessment items from the formal discipline (i.e., the Force Concept Inventory)?
2.3. Game-based learning environments across countries
In addition to the challenges of helping students articulate the tacit intuitive understandings they develop through game play in terms of
the explicit concepts and representations of the formal discipline, there are also important questions to ask in terms of the degree to which
the resulting learning environments will be viable across different countries. In other words, will a game-based learning environment
developed in one country be productive in other countries?
Hofstede (2001, 2008) has carefully chronicled how differences across countries can dramatically impact teaching, learning, and other
phenomena. In recent years, researchers in the ﬁeld of science education have adopted theoretical perspectives that view learning as
mediated by linguistic, cultural, and social factors to better understand the schooling experiences (e.g., Aikenhead & Jegede, 1999; Lee, 2005;
Warren, Ballenger, Ogonowski, Rosebery, & Hudicourt-Barnes, 2001). In a synthesis of research literature, Lee (2005) includes theoretical

D.B. Clark et al. / Computers & Education 57 (2011) 2178–2195

2181

perspectives which suggest that learning is possible when it occurs in contexts that are culturally, linguistically, and cognitively meaningful
and relevant to students. Science teaching tends to vary across countries (Aikenhead & Otsuji, 2000) and learning is productively considered
a cultural process even within a single classroom (Nasir, Rosebery, Warren, & Lee, 2006). Building on these ideas, a number of researchers
have explored connections between students’ understandings from “everyday” and culturally-speciﬁc contexts and their learning of formal
disciplinary concepts and idea (George & Glasgow, 1988; Rosebery, Warren, Ballenger, & Ogonowski, 2005; Snively & Corsiglia, 2001; Warren
& Rosebery, 2008). To better understand the potential of digital games more globally, we therefore explore similarities and differences
between how students from two countries (and two different cultures) relate to, and learn from, the conceptually-integrated physics game
at the heart of the current study. The purpose of this study focuses speciﬁcally on identifying potential similarities and differences between
countries. This will then provide a foundation and starting point for future studies exploring the complex cultural factors in the two
countries that might contribute to these similarities and differences.
Research Question 2. How similar or different are the learning and affective experiences of students playing the game in two different
countries (i.e., Taiwan and the United States)?
3. Methods
The current study presents ongoing research with a conceptually-integrated physics game that we have developed called SURGE. The
research is funded by the U.S. National Science Foundation through a grant with the same name (Scaffolding Understanding by Redesigning
Games for Education). The current study analyzes and discusses results from research with SURGE in schools in Taiwan and the United
States. The following sections describe the participants, data collection, secondary research conditions, and the game context.
3.1. Participants
3.1.1. Taiwan
Data in Taiwan was collected for 71 eighth grade students and 137 ninth grade students in seven classes taught by two teachers at two
public middle schools. The students were in standard science classes, 58.9% female, and represented the full range of students at the school
because science is not a “tracked” subject at the school (i.e., a subject in which students are “tracked” into different classes based on
achievement).
3.1.2. United States
Data was collected in the U.S. for 72 students in ﬁve seventh grade classes in a diverse but predominantly African-American urban school
in the southeastern United States. The students were in the standard 7th-grade science classes, 58.3% female, and represented the full range
of students at the school because science is not a “tracked” subject at the school.
3.2. Data collection
The study was conducted during the school day over the course of approximately three class periods for each group of students in each
country. The students completed a pre-test, post-test, and short written survey. Data collected and analyzed in the studies included:
C

Pre-tests and post-tests focusing on players’ understanding of formal “instructed concepts” through an instrument including 12
multiple-choice items based on the Force Concept Inventory (FCI) (Hestenes & Halloun, 1995; Hestenes, Wells, & Swackhamer, 1992;
Jackson, 2007). Four questions focused on the application of impulses to objects, four focused on interpreting kinematics (i.e., position,
velocity, and acceleration) in dot trace representations, and four focused on the application of constant acceleration to objects. Nine of
the twelve items were based directly on a simpliﬁed version of the FCI (Jackson, 2007), including three of the impulse questions, two of
the dot trace kinematics questions, and all four of the constant acceleration questions. We created one impulse question and two dot
trace kinematics questions that mirrored the FCI questions so that we could have four questions in each category. This study focuses on
these FCI questions and does not analyze four vector concept items (Nguyen & Meltzer, 2003; Shaffer & McDermott, 2005) that were
part of a separate study (D’Angelo, 2010). The FCI, recognized in the international physics education community as one of the best
measures of academic conceptual understanding in physics, measures formalized conceptual understanding of Newtonian mechanics
and kinematics. In the Taiwan study, these tests were conducted using a separate survey website (surveymonkey.com), and in the USA
studies, they were done within the SURGE software environment.
Our studies included a survey, taken by students after completing the post-test. It was composed of (a) a multiple-choice section,
asking students to rate their affective response to SURGE on a Likert-type scale, whether they believed that SURGE would be more
appealing to girls or boys, queried students about their gender, and how much they themselves played video games normally; (b)
a free-response section in which we asked students which pre-test questions did playing SURGE help them to answer, and what added
features or improvements they would like to see in future versions of the game.
Observations were made by researchers of students playing the game during each trial in terms of students’ actions, reactions, and
attitudes playing the game. These observations were collected primarily as ﬁeld notes to inform revisions to the design of SURGE. The
research group then discussed these observations and synthesized them to provide additional insight into the learning and affective
ﬁndings from the tests and surveys.
In addition to the data sources discussed above, which were common to Taiwan and the U.S. implementations, the U.S. implementation also collected students’ scores during game play on individual trials of each level. We analyze the data on game-play scores
and numbers of trials attempted to check for interactions between gender, learning outcomes, how much students reported liking the
game, how many times the students attempted levels (which means how many times they replayed levels rather than simply choosing
to move on to the next level), and how successful students were in playing the game (as represented by higher scores on levels during
game play).

3.3. Secondary research conditions
In addition to the main comparison between countries, students in each country were also randomly assigned within their classrooms to
a secondary condition as pilots for future development. These secondary conditions did not affect core game play. These comparisons were
conducted to check potential subtleties in game design on learning.
3.3.1. Taiwan
Students were randomly assigned to one of two conditions focusing on the degree of storyline included in the level introduction and level
summary “cut scene” pages. In the control condition, cut scene pages included more minimal storyline in the cut scenes. The experimental
condition added some additional detail to the storyline. Both conditions included the same instructions and science content.
3.3.2. United States
Students were randomly assigned to one of two conditions in terms of the inclusion of the velocity cross representation, which is one of
the formal representations included in the SURGE. One condition included this representation in the game levels and the other did not.
Ultimately, neither of these secondary conditions made a signiﬁcant impact on learning outcomes, and thus they are not discussed in
these analyses, but they were part of the data collection process and they are therefore described here.
3.4. SURGE game context
We utilized our SURGE physics game environment as the platform for research. We built SURGE within the Unity 3D game engine
(unity3d.com). SURGE is a conceptually-integrated game, as deﬁned earlier, rather than a conceptually-embedded game for learning (i.e.,
the science to be learned is integrated directly into the mechanics of navigating through the game world rather than being embedded as an
activity that is visited in the game world, as is typically the structure in many virtual worlds designed for science learning). The SURGE
platform is intended to investigate design principles for connecting students’ intuitive “spontaneous concepts” about kinematics and
Newtonian mechanics into formalized “instructed concepts” by overlaying mechanics of popular commercial video games with “marble”
mechanics such as Mario Galaxy and Switchball with formal representations and connections to formal concepts of Newtonian mechanics.
SURGE incorporates the game play designs of these popular “marble” games in the context of a space-based adventure (Figs. 2 and 3).
Students play the game as the character Surge, a smart and brave female alien, who is being called upon to save the adorable Fuzzies from
the evil Emperor Hooke. Another character, named Lerpz, gives Surge advice throughout the game and helps scaffold the actions and physics
concepts that the students learn while playing. The Fuzzies also help Surge along the way, providing information about the special Motion
Map Regions in the game and encouraging Surge as she travels through the levels. Students use the arrow keys on their keyboards to
navigate around barriers and through corridors, trying to ﬁnd the Fuzzies that they need to save. The levels are designed so that physics
concepts build upon one another and gradually introduce the student to new ideas and ways of interacting with the game world. The two
studies in this paper focus on thirteen levels of the SURGE game, broken up into two modules. The ﬁrst module uses an impulse control
system, where every time the student pushes an arrow key a ﬁxed impulse is applied to Surge’s ship (represented as a white ball in the
game). The second module uses a constant force control system, where students can hold down an arrow key to apply a constant force in
that direction. Overlaid on the screen are different read-outs of information for the student, including their ship’s current speed, the number
of impulses they’ve used, the number of collisions with the walls, and their elapsed time on a given game level. Students are told to minimize
their collisions, level completion time, and number of impulses in order to get a high score. There are also on-screen buttons used to reset or
pause the level and to stabilize Surge’s ship if it starts moving out of control. A vector representation of students’ velocity is also on the
screen, showing their current speed and direction. Some levels include a Motion Map Region, where students must maintain a constant
velocity, increase their speed, or decrease their speed (a Fuzzy tells them which one to do) in order to continue in the level.
Our driving design principles and initial goals for SURGE are summarized below.
C

Overlay popular game-play mechanics with key formal physics representations including vector representations and dot traces. We wanted
to build these formal representations into the game such that using the representations would be fundamentally useful and
advantageous to players. Our vector display, for example, included both composite and component vectors so that players could more
easily determine how many impulses or acceleration would be required in a given direction to achieve their goals. Similarly, the dot

trace representations were designed to help the player visualize constant and changing velocities as part of helping them master these
ideas and techniques for puzzles within the game involving “velocity detection zones” that served as keys the players used to unlock
passageways.
Each level involves speciﬁc challenges directly linked to physics concepts. To complete these challenges, students need to learn and apply
many principles related to mechanics (e.g., impulse, inertia, vector addition, elastic collision, gravity, velocity, acceleration, free-fall, mass,
force, projectile motion). In levels with the “velocity detection zones”, for example, the puzzle involved ﬁguring out what constant
velocity entailed in order to maneuver safely through the level and unlock passageways. In order to navigate through the level, a player
needed to understand characteristics of constant and changing velocities. Other levels created their challenges or puzzles around
combining vector components. All of these challenges, however, were enacted through the player’s navigation through the game
world. The challenges were thus integrated into the mechanics of world rather being challenges simply embedded into the world. This
is, in fact, what distinguishes conceptually-integrated games from conceptually-embedded games.1
Each level highlights one or two topics, and levels allow students to connect the concepts together and to see the relations that exist among
the topics. For example, in the multiple dimensional motion levels, students learn and apply the concept of applying impulses at right
angles to produce motion in two dimensions. This builds on students’ knowledge of additive and canceling impulses and motion in
one dimension, and extends that knowledge to include the resultant motion of impulses at right angles. This approach allows students
to gain a ﬁrm grasp of a concept before new concepts are introduced.
Protect students from failure and seek to minimize frustration for novice players. We did not want to create a game that would be
productive for players with extensive gaming experience but that was frustrating or less productive for less experienced players. We
therefore intend to minimize frustration and scaffold success for less experienced players. As an example, the early levels do not
include ﬁxed failure triggers forcing the level to reset (e.g., our initial versions of SURGE do not include the possibility of Surge’s ship
exploding after a set number of collisions). If a player can complete a level they earn at least a bronze medal for that completion. Silver
medals are intended to be fairly challenging to attain, and the gold medals are meant to be very challenging. This is a design principle
that we discovered required modiﬁcation (as discussed later in this article) to be balanced with the idea that players also cannot be
allowed to progress to subsequent levels without ﬁrst attaining a certain baseline of mastery. There is therefore a tension between
protecting students from failure while also requiring certain levels of mastery for advancement. We discuss this in further detail later
in this article.
Integrate physics ideas and terminology into pre-level and post-level story and feedback screens and within the levels of the game itself.
Several levels, for example, include “detection” corridors where the player needs to maintain a constant velocity, increase their
velocity, or decrease their velocity in order to open a gate. This speciﬁc terminology is explicitly delivered as instructions by a friendly
non-player character (a “Fuzzy”) in the level and is central to succeeding in the level. As discussed later in this article, we continue to
consider this design principle as critical to helping players connect intuitive and formal understandings, but we found through this
research that we need to (a) focus further on the “just in time” aspects of this scaffolding within the play of the level itself and (b) make

1
Note that while the focus of SURGE and this article is on the structure and affordances of conceptually-integrated games, the authors also acknowledge that
conceptually-embedded games for learning (such as games set in virtual worlds where players takes on the roles of scientists) also have valuable affordances, but
conceptually-embedded games are more often studies and are not the purpose of this article (although the authors do conduct research and development on these games as
parts of other projects and think highly of their speciﬁc affordances). Thus, this article should not be read as claiming that conceptually-integrated games are superior to
conceptually-embedded games, but instead should be read to think speciﬁcally about the affordances of conceptually-integrated games and their design for learning.

the pre-level and post-level story elements more interactive and game-like themselves to increase the players’ interaction and
engagement with the ideas in these pre-level and post-level elements (otherwise players often skip right over the pre-level and postlevel story elements).
Incorporate foundational multimedia principles into the design to the interfaces (e.g., Clark, Nguyen, & Sweller, 2006; Mayer, 2009) to reduce
unnecessary cognitive load for the player to process the ideas and information in the game. Games tend to involve contexts that are
visually much richer than those found in other multimedia formats for learning (such as simulations). This can easily lead to players
not understanding which aspects or details of the screen are salient and which are just environmental detail. We have observed in our
research, for example, that players sometimes don’t even realize that they have the key representations unless they are centered on
their ship (the sphere they are moving through the game). If the representation is placed in the lower corner of the screen, players
sometimes don’t notice it at all. In a recent study where players in each classroom were randomly assigned to versions of the game that
included the vector representation either in the corner of the screen or centered on their sphere, a player who had the representation
in the corner pointed to the screen of his neighbor (whose vector representation was centered on the sphere) and asked why he didn’t
get a “speed representation” – When we pointed our his representation, he said, “Wow! I can’t believe I didn’t see it!” Thus, we believe
that careful application of multimedia principles to signal and cue attention may be even more important in game design than in the
design of other multimedia formats for learning.

3.5. Relationship of SURGE to the normal curriculum
The implementations of SURGE for this study preceded the normal units that the teachers in Taiwan and the U.S. planned to teach. SURGE
was introduced to the students in this context. As a teacher in Taiwan explained to the students, “SURGE relates to the concepts of force and
motion, which you will learn later in the textbook”. The students were therefore given some framing for the game in terms of curricular
goals, but they had not studied the topics so as to provide any in-depth background for the game in terms of the curriculum for the current
study. Thus, SURGE preceded the normal curriculum, but the teachers provided some connections for the students between SURGE and
what was to follow in the curriculum.
Later when the Taiwanese and U.S. teachers taught the force and motion unit (text-book based in Taiwan and a mix of textbook and other
materials in the U.S.), they asked students to recall SURGE and used the examples from SURGE, such as how a spaceship can change its
direction in outer space? Some students in both countries expressed that they hoped to play SURGE again when the teacher mentioned
examples from SURGE. All three teachers thought it would have been beneﬁcial if they opened SURGE and explained concepts in the
curriculum in terms of the students’ prior experience with SURGE, but due to the limits of time, the teachers only verbally mentioned SURGE
instead of bringing students to the computer lab to use SURGE again. Thus, while the teachers did not later use SURGE again during the
normal unit, they did refer to it to provide examples during their regular unit’s textbook-based teaching.
4. Results
The following sections outline the (a) learning outcomes on the tests, (b) affective outcomes from the surveys and interviews, and (c)
observations by the researchers in each country. We then discuss and compare and discuss similarities and differences between and within
countries.
4.1. Learning outcomes
4.1.1. Overall
A matched-pairs t-test analysis was conducted on the pre and post-test scores achieved by students. This test revealed signiﬁcant
learning gains across the two countries for the 12-item pre-test and post-test when considering total scores, M (pre-test) ¼ 3.79, SD ¼ 2.20;
M (post-test) ¼ 4.16, SD ¼ 2.49; t(250) ¼ 2.70, p (one-tailed) ¼ 0.004. An item-by-item analysis using McNemar’s c2 test showed signiﬁcant
gains were on item 4, c2 (1251) ¼ 14.02, p < .001, Cohen’s d ¼ 0.1541 and item 11, c2 (1251) ¼ 4.40, p ¼ .036, Cohen’s d ¼ 0.344 (Fig. 4a and
b present these items).
4.1.2. Taiwan
A matched-pairs t-test analysis was conducted on the pre and post-test scores achieved by students on 12-item test. This test revealed
signiﬁcant learning gains when considering total scores, M (pre-test) ¼ 4.35, SD ¼ 2.18; M (post-test) ¼ 4.73, SD ¼ 2.54; t(179) ¼ 2.431, p
(one-tailed) ¼ 0.008, Cohen’s d ¼ 0.1619. An item-by-item analysis using McNemar’s c2 test revealed that students improved their
performance in some speciﬁc parts of the assessment more than in others: signiﬁcant gains were observed on items 4, c2 (1180) ¼ 20.10,
p < .001; item 11, c2(1180) ¼ 10.41, p ¼ .001; item 1, c2 (1180) ¼ 5.14, p ¼ .023; and almost signiﬁcant gains on item 6, c2 (1180) ¼ 3.75,
p ¼ .053 (Fig. 4a and b present these items). Although the net performance gain for these items was modest (0.365 SD max, 0.178 SD min),
these gains were consistent across gender and levels of gaming experience.
4.1.3. United States
A matched-pairs t-test was conducted on the test scores achieved by students before and after a single play session of SURGE,
approximately 45 min long. Students did not show a signiﬁcant improvement in test total scores, M (pre-test) ¼ 2.38, SD ¼ 2.32; M (posttest) ¼ 2.62, SD ¼ 2.67; t(70) ¼ 1.211, p (one-tailed) ¼ 0.115. A item-wise analysis using McNemar’s test for c2, similar to the one used in the
Taiwan study, was used to ﬁnd signiﬁcant gains in speciﬁc items, but did not show conclusive results, partly because the much smaller
sample size (N ¼ 71 vs. 180 in the previous study) was detrimental to the statistical power of our assessment, and also potentially because
a number of students raced through the post-test so that they could continue playing the game (see discussion of researcher observations in
the Results section below). That said, three of the items with the largest gains matched three of the four items from the Taiwan implementation with the largest gains. These items included items 1, 6, and 11.

Fig. 4. a. Items 1 and 4 from the pre/post-test based on items from the simpliﬁed FCI (Hestenes & Halloun, 1995; Hestenes et al.,1992; Jackson, 2007). b. Items 6 and 11 from the pre/posttest based on items from the simpliﬁed FCI* (Hestenes & Halloun, 1995; Hestenes et al., 1992; Jackson, 2007). (* Question 6 was based directly on the Simpliﬁed FCI test, which included
the scientist’s gender as male. As part of our goal of supporting gender equity through SURGE, future versions of the assessment will change the scientist’s gender to female.)

4.2. Affective ﬁndings
4.2.1. Taiwan
The majority of the students liked their experiences using SURGE. When asked “how much did you like playing SURGE?” in the postsurvey, over half (62.4%) of the 208 students liked or really liked playing SURGE. About 31% thought it was okay, and only 6.4% did not
like it (Fig. 5). This result is consistent with the classroom observations that many students showed high motivation and engagement as they
used SURGE. Moreover, 69.8% thought that SURGE is fun for both male and female students. The majority of the students believe that SURGE
is fun regardless of gender.
The students had used computers in the laboratory for their computer courses but not for their science courses. Their experiences in
playing computer games varied: 42.6% of the students usually spend 1–2 h per week and 33.2% spend 3–6 h per week playing computer
games; 10% spend more than 12 h and another 10% do not play games at all. In general, more males in this group play video games than
females, with 20 males vs. 6 females reporting intensive video game experience (i.e., 12 or more hours or play per week), and 18 females vs. 3
males reporting no video game use at all (Fig. 6).
When asked “What did the game help you learn on the test?”, many students directly speciﬁed the item numbers of the test on
which playing SURGE helped the learning. Of the responses, 41.1% indicated between one and four speciﬁc items, and 46.9% indicated
more than ﬁve items of the test that the learning experience with SURGE helped. Generally speaking, the majority of the students
thought that SURGE helped them on the test, and 22.4% indicated that SURGE helped a lot, but 12% of the students indicated that SURGE
did not help.
When asked to make suggestions to help improve SURGE, many students (44.2%) focused on the representational aspects. For example,
students indicated that if the Chinese characters would be clearer the learning process would even be better facilitated, which is perfectly
reasonable as we discuss later in the implementation observations section below. About 17% of the students made suggestions on the
content. Some of these students suggested that we should increase the complexity of the tasks while some other students suggested
decreasing the complexity. Some other students made suggestions on how to make the game more fun, such as including monsters, music
and sound effects, and so forth. These are not directly related to the learning content but may seem essential to the students to fulﬁll their
expectation of what constitutes a computer game.
SURGE elicited generally positive affective responses from participants in this study (M ¼ 2.21, where 1 is most positive response and 5
least positive, SD ¼ 0.97), with more positive response among males (M ¼ 1.90, SD ¼ 0.78) than females (M ¼ 2.41, SD ¼ 1.01). The test group
as a whole expressed the opinion that SURGE would be more interesting to females than to males (45 responses vs. 8, of those who
expressed an opinion).
4.2.2. United States
Students in the United States had a more positive response to SURGE than did the Taiwan students (M ¼ 1.72, where 1 is the most positive
response and 5 the most negative, SD ¼ 0.89), although interest in the game did not correlate with improved learning outcome. SURGE was
slightly better received by females (M ¼ 1.59, SD ¼ 0.83) than by males (M ¼ 1.90, SD ¼ 0.96), although paradoxically, students as a whole
expressed the opinion that the game would be more interesting to males (16 responses vs. 6). No students reported a strongly negative
response to SURGE (Fig. 5).
With regards to their gaming experience, 34% of the students reported they normally play 1–2 h per week, 33% responded 3–6 h per
week, and 10% (6 females, 1 male) said they played no video games at all. Fifteen percent of students reported playing games extensively
(12 h per week or more). Males in this group are more likely to be video game players than females; 14 of the 30 males in this sample play 7 h
per week or more, while only 4 of the 42 females say they play that much (Fig. 6).
When asked for suggestions for improving SURGE, 24 students (33%) provided substantive responses; the most popular suggestions
addressed issues of game design or game metaphor (n ¼ 14), requests for more varied content (n ¼ 6), and increased difﬁculty (n ¼ 4). The
number and quality of suggestions we received revealed to us the extent and quality of the participants’ gaming templates and vocabularies,
which remain central to our view of how the well the game is received by students.
After the post-test, students were asked to report on what they had learned from playing SURGE. Out of 71 respondents, 35 mentioned
a better understanding of velocity and/or speed (49%), 6 mentioned acceleration (8%), while 7 felt they had learned nothing at all (10%). Since

velocity is addressed in the game in the form of detection zones focusing on formal physics dot trace representations, we conclude that this
particular feature is effective at focusing students’ conceptual thinking. Although students tended to recall the concept of velocity in the
surveys, whether or not the detection zone feature supports learning outcomes is unclear, as none of the FCI assessment items that were
used highlight the concept of velocity-as-vector, which is distinct from the more intuitive notion of speed.
4.3. Relationship of game-play scores to learning, affective reaction, and gender
In addition to the data sources discussed above, which were common to Taiwan and the U.S. implementations, the U.S. implementation
also included the collection of students’ scores during game play for each individual trial (attempt/play-through) of each level. We wanted to
check for any possible interactions between gender, how frequently a student replayed levels, achievement in game play (as represented by
a student’s best score on each level), gains on the post-test, and how much students expressed liking the game (as measured by their rating
of how much they liked the game on the survey after playing the game). We did not observe any interactions between greater achievement
in game play, as measured in z-normed scores per level based on the each student’s best score on each level, and learning gains or expressed
affective reaction to SURGE. Similarly, number of times players replayed levels they had completed (either for fun or to attempt to get
a higher score) does not correlate with learning gains, students’ affective response to SURGE or increased gaming habit/experience. In
comparing test gains with affective reaction on the survey, we found that test gains did not correlate with affective reaction, suggesting that
students do not necessarily have to enjoy SURGE to beneﬁt from play.
In terms of gender, we found that boys did not achieve better learning outcomes than girls (as reported earlier), regardless of boys’
greater self-reported gaming experience (1–6 h per week was the most frequent response for girls, 7 h or more was more frequent for boys).
However, there was a different play dynamic among boys and girls. We found that boys had more completed trials (attempts) than girls
on levels in the game, M (boys) ¼ 20.66 vs. M (girls) ¼ 17.38, t(70) ¼ 2.32, p ¼ .012. Since the version of SURGE they played has a total of
13 levels, these numbers indicate that both genders were replaying levels, not merely advancing through levels without regard for the
scores they had achieved. Boys on average more replayed levels than girls, M (boys) ¼ 1.76 plays/level attempted, M (girls) ¼ 1.59,
t(70) ¼ 1.85, p ¼ .033.We also found that boys had higher “best scores” on levels in the game. When considering only the highest score
achieved for all replays of each level (the player’s “best score” on a level), boys averaged 0.115 SD above the mean for all students on each
level, while the girls scored 0.017 SD above the mean for their “best score”, although the difference is not statistically signiﬁcant (p ¼ .25).
Furthermore, the variances in “best scores” within both genders are much larger within than between genders (within boys ¼ 0.43 SD and
within girls ¼ 0.30 SD). If there were a difference here in terms of “best scores” between genders, it would likely stem from the earlier
reported ﬁnding that boys replayed each level more than girls (1.76 replays/level vs. 1.59), so the increased average “best score” would
perhaps be the result of repeated practice.
In summary, as reported, boys and girls did not demonstrate differences in learning outcomes, nor were learning outcomes correlated
with reported gaming habit. This suggests that SURGE provides a relatively novel experience for this age group that does not favor more
experienced gamers nor does it favor boys overall, although boys appear to replay levels somewhat more frequently.
4.4. Implementation observations
As outlined in the Methods section, ﬁeld notes were collected by researchers as students played the game during each trial in terms of
students’ actions, reactions, and attitudes playing the game. The research group then discussed these observations and synthesized them to
provide further insight into the test and survey data.
4.4.1. Taiwan
In general the teachers and students had positive reactions to SURGE. The teachers were satisﬁed when they observed that the students
were all engaged in SURGE. All the students showed high interest and engagement in SURGE at the beginning of the game, and this
engagement remained strong for most students throughout the program. The students concentrated on the SURGE interface with little offtask behavior. They asked technical and conceptual questions, indicating that they were mindfully engaged. When questions arose students

2188

D.B. Clark et al. / Computers & Education 57 (2011) 2178–2195

sought help from the teacher and sometimes from their peers. The students were heard making discovery sounds such as “a-ha” or laughing
with enjoyment, indicating that they were positively motivated.
Student engagement was high in spite of technical challenges related to displaying Chinese characters clearly on the older computers
used by students in the Taiwan implementation. While Unity (the program that the game was developed in) could display English characters
perfectly on older PC computers, we discovered that Unity did not handle Chinese characters as well on older PC computers, with the result
that the Chinese characters in many cases became too blurry to for the students to read. To attempt to compensate, we created accompanying paper document materials keyed to the game levels showing Chinese text so that students could read it. While this worked, it was
sub-optimal, and we believe that this approach diminished the learning opportunities for students by adding confusion to the task and
increasing learner extraneous cognitive load related to switching attention between the game and the document. Most students read the
printed documents only at the beginning of the game and then went through the levels without looking at the documents again.
We observed that some students completed all the levels in SURGE much more quickly than others. Some students showed quick
proﬁciency at controlling SURGE game elements, resulting in ﬁnishing the game faster. This might relate to the diversity of students’
previous experiences playing computer games. Students also learned efﬁcient strategies for completing the game while playing. For
example, many students did not succeed in passing the detection zones in the ﬁrst several levels and needed to go back. However, most
students learned to control the spaceship to successfully pass the detection zones after four or ﬁve levels. Students were generally
observed to be purposeful and mindful in their interactions with the game independent of the pace at which they progressed through the
game, with the exception of their interactions with the printed documents. The teachers thought that the different amounts of time that
students needed to ﬁnish could pose classroom-management challenges for teachers. Another challenge for teachers involved deciding
how and when to guide and remind students to slow down and think to improve learning with SURGE. The students might have thought
they were supposed to complete the tasks in SURGE as quickly as possible without paying attention to the other goals that SURGE
highlighted.
We observed three design elements in SURGE that seemed to impact students’ performances, each in a different way: the velocity cross
representation, the “stabilize” button, and the virtual medal award system. The velocity cross representation helped students visualize the
current status of the spaceship and plan their subsequent actions. The “stabilize” button helped students regain control if the spaceship
collided with walls too much or involved too many forces. Over-dependence on the stabilize button was observed in the USA implementation. In contrast, only a few students overused the stabilize button in the Taiwan implementation. The medal award given at the end of
each level motivated students to seek strategies to better reach the goals (and thereby earn ‘higher’ medals). We observed that the students
cared about and compared with peers what kind of medal they received at the end of each level for the purpose of having fun (as opposed to
taking this seriously as the only goal to achieve). They hoped to earn a gold medal but seemed comfortable when getting other medals. The
students cared much less about the score they received at the end of each level than the color of their medal.
Overall, the Taiwanese teachers stated their belief that SURGE brought novel learning experiences to the students, which related to the
high motivation and engagement that the students showed. Although the students were quite proﬁcient at using computers in their
everyday experiences, the majority of their prior science learning experiences involved learning knowledge from their teacher and textbooks through lectures. This was the students’ ﬁrst time to use a game-like program in their science lessons. The context, functions and
features of SURGE also kept the motivation and engagement high throughout.
4.4.2. United States
As in Taiwan, the teachers and students had positive reactions to SURGE. The students were very excited to see the laptops in their
classroom when they entered. As one student exclaimed, “Alright! This is more like it! This is what science is supposed to be!” The students
were very excited about playing the game and there was animated talk between players across the room. An assistant principal at the school
came to observe one of the class periods as part of his standard annual observations of new teachers at the school. At the end of the class
period, he was visibly very excited about SURGE. He said that he had “never seen these kids so engaged and on-task”. When the lead author
returned to the school the following week to judge science fair projects, several students asked when they could play SURGE again, and the
mother of another student came up to the lead author to tell him how much her daughter had liked SURGE. These types of comments in
conjunction with the survey responses and our own observations of student engagement lead us to believe that SURGE was indeed engaging
and interesting for the students. While engagement was high, though, we also noticed a few issues during this implementation meriting
consideration.
As seen in Taiwan, students were not interested in reading the introductory and summary cut scenes for the levels. Unless we talked to
the students and explained that students in earlier classes had gotten lost when they didn’t read the introduction screens, most students
spent little or no time reading the introduction screens and instead clicked right through to the level itself. Similarly, they tended to check
the summary screens only for the color of the medal they had earned (bronze, silver, or gold).
Also as seen in Taiwan, students completed the game at different rates. While some students were interested in the color of medal they
earned, other students were less concerned about the points and medals than they were in simply advancing to the next level as quickly as
possible. As one student said after crashing and bludgeoning SURGE to the end of each level and seldom earning higher than a bronze medal,
“Ha! I beat your game!” Many students mirrored this general sentiment of having great interest in the achievement in getting to the end of
the game, with less interest in the achievement of getting gold medals on each level. After ﬁnishing the last level, some students went back
to try and earn gold medals on each level, but a number of students also went back and created new unintended challenges for themselves,
such as seeing how many collisions they could rack up or how high a velocity they could achieve. Essentially, most of the students pursued
challenging goals, but their goals didn’t always parallel the performance goals that we had aligned with developing understanding of the
targeted core concepts.
We also noticed that some students positioned the mouse pointer over the stabilize button and used that feature each time they wanted
to come to a standstill. We had added the stabilize button to help players who were having a hard time regaining control. However, because
the players largely were not interested in points or were not aware of the points and how the scoring worked, they used this stabilize button
as their primary means of stopping. They did not view this strategy as circumventing the purpose or goals of the game in any manner. From
their perspective, they appeared to view this as the intended, logical, and obvious approach within the game, which it could well be

D.B. Clark et al. / Computers & Education 57 (2011) 2178–2195

2189

considered to be from a game mechanics perspective, even though this perspective competed negatively with our pedagogical goals of
having students apply impulses to moderate their velocity (and thus come to understand the independence of the x and y axis velocity
components and the need to account for both when changing directions in the maze).
5. Discussion and comparisons
In summary, there were important trends across the implementations.
5.1. Embodied and intuitive learning
We see learning gains on the assessment items most directly related to the embodied experience of navigating the SURGE ship through
the game space, particularly for items where key terms and ideas were integrated into the game play in a manner that player’s success was
made contingent on consciously understanding the terms and ideas. As an example, players tend to make connections between their
experiences maneuvering their ship in the game and questions regarding how the application of constant force or impulse will affect the
trajectories on the tests. Similarly, while there were not speciﬁc questions on the pre/post-test about the meaning of constant velocity,
observations and surveys suggest that students clariﬁed their understanding of velocity as including both speed and direction, as well as
ideas of increasing velocity, decreasing velocity, and constant velocity, through the inclusion of those concepts directly into the challenge of
unlocking gates to allow passage through the levels. As we have described, out of 71 students in the U.S. implementation, 35 speciﬁcally
answered ‘velocity’ when asked what the game helped them learn. The term velocity was integrated into the game itself, appearing
frequently on pre and post-game level summary screens as part of the goals and feedback information provided to players. Seemingly, use of
the formalized physics term in conjunction with game play making use of velocity as a core element bolstered student awareness of the
term. It is less clear, from the data collected thus far, whether familiarity with the term correlates with stronger understanding of the
concept. In our future work, we can make use of the data collected around formalized language use associated with game play in SURGE to
help teachers scaffold follow-up classroom-based discussions around the terms most frequently appearing in game log ﬁles. These scaffolded discussions can help tease out the level to which integrated formalized language in the game bolsters not just vocabulary acquisition
but also corresponding conceptual understanding, in addition to echoes of conceptual learning found via FCI questions.
Interestingly, the FCI questions tend to focus more on intuitive understanding rather than measuring explicit understanding. We chose
the FCI because it is the most well known test of conceptual understanding of force and motion. We wanted to use a recognized and accepted
benchmark of physics understanding rather than a test we created (which could be viewed as less strong evidence for learning from
a physicist’s perspective). In our future studies, though, we will develop more of our own items for the test that include a focus on the more
formal aspects of understanding. Increasing the sensitivity of the assessment items to the connections between formal and intuitive
understandings will likely require further scaffolding of explicit formal ideas and their connection to the intuitive understanding that
students’ are currently developing through game play. This further emphasis on connections between intuitive and formal understandings
will continue to be a core focus of SURGE research and development.
This will involve rethinking and redesigning how we handle the introductions and summaries of levels for players, and we will need to
increase our emphasis on supports for connecting intuitive and formal understandings within the levels themselves. We observed similarities across the implementations with respect to the tendency of players to skim or skip the text in the introductory and summary screens.
This underscores the importance of scaffolding concepts, terminology, and feedback “just in time” as discussed by Gee (2003, 2007). We also
noted that players tend to streamline play goals and obstacles such that very careful alignment between play goals and obstacles and
learning goals is critical to the success of these games from a learning perspective.
5.2. Comparison of learning gains across countries
As reported, the matched-pairs t-test of gains across the full test was signiﬁcant for the students as group, t(250) ¼ 2.0792, p (onetailed) ¼ 0.019. Effect size and power are modest at 0.1066 and 0.211, respectively. In addition, we found it interesting to note that, for
a speciﬁc sub-set of items, students from both groups showed some increase in scores. Fig. 7 provides a comparison of gains across the three
items that evidenced substantial gains for both countries.
Using software, we simulated this phenomenon using a hypergeometric distribution, considering several sets of parameters to account
for differing assumptions, the discussion of which is not central to the topic of this paper. Depending on which set of parameters is used, the
probability of these three assessment items emerging randomly from the two studies is 0.03 < p < .11. Although it is possible that this is
a random effect, an examination of the assessment items in question indicates why this might not be the case (Fig. 4a and b). These items ask
students to perform a similar task: to predict the motion of an object when acted upon by a new force. This task of internal simulation is
remarkably similar to the process that a player must perform in order to effectively play SURGE, i.e., to guide the SURGE ship through a maze
by applying a series of forces. An additional feature shared by these assessment items is the presence of elements reminiscent of the control
scheme used in SURGE, or a clear analog thereof.
For these reasons, we believe that increased student performance on these particular items may be a function of how the items
themselves address the physics concepts in a more embodied way than other items which are conceptually similar but presented differently; under this framework, students who play SURGE would develop an internal physics model that is that is more contextually and
conceptually embodied (see Gee, 2003, c.f. Wilson, 2002, for an overview on embodied cognition and its theoretical implications for
learning) than what general instruments such as the FCI tend to detect. Part of our current effort is now devoted to developing an instrument
that places greater emphasis on the embodied cognitive elements of SURGE, those that students seem to access according to these results.
Considering the differences across countries, and in curricular knowledge of physics between the groups, the existence of a stable sub-set
of assessment items in which we see improved scores is very encouraging; it indicates a fundamental match between the way the students
engage and reﬂect on the principles of physics presented in SURGE and the manner in which these principles are assessed by our FCI-based
instrument, without an overriding dependence on frameworks that are dependent on cultural context. This idea is further reinforced by the

2190

observed trend of both groups to generally disregard textual (i.e., language-based) content, and that, due to technical issues, some students
in the Taiwan group had no access to the text of the game at all. Our contention is not, however, that students were adopting a culturallyneutral stance while playing SURGE (see Sections 5.3 and 5.4 for our discussion of these stances), but rather, that their learning was not
contingent on speciﬁc cultural cues.
5.3. Comparison of game play experience/habits across countries
The survey questions used in the SURGE assessment for the Taiwan and U.S. implementations gave us an enlightening view into the
differences and similarities of these two groups. One interesting point of comparison is that both these groups present almost identical
“gaming proﬁles”: the proportions of students who play video games for a certain amount of time per week is very similar across groups,
both aggregate and by gender (Fig. 6). These proﬁles are typical for American adolescents (Cummings & Vandewater, 2007), and while we
did not preselect students on any gaming experience criteria, it is helpful for our research that these ﬁndings are not predicated on whether
students have highly-evolved or developing gaming templates and vocabularies.
The distribution of genders is also worth noting. Both groups show a gender difference at the extreme ends of the gaming spectrum: in
both groups, respondents who say they almost never play video games are most likely to be girls, whereas the most avid video game players
are likely to be boys. One of our initial concerns regarded whether or not gender would be an important factor for learning when students
played SURGE, both by itself and as a predictor of a more evolved gaming vocabulary. There is a perception that the video game medium as
a whole has a bias toward males (Cassell & Jenkins, 1998; Kafai, Heeter, Denner, & Sun, 2008), so we would not have been surprised to see
a gender difference in learning gains or attitudes toward SURGE. However, in neither implementation was gender a signiﬁcant factor
affecting performance in the assessment.
5.4. Comparison of perceptions and reactions toward SURGE across countries
In terms of important affective similarities, the majority of players across ages, genders, levels of game playing experience and cultures in
both implementations found the SURGE enjoyable and engaging (Table 1). The high levels of engagement appeared to go beyond a “novelty
effect” in that players’ engagement remained high from beginning to end of the SURGE game. This is a notable ﬁnding because one might be
justiﬁably concerned that embedding science learning curricula in digital games might be enjoyable or engaging only to subsets of the
students, which would not be acceptable for digital games intended to be adopted as part of a standard science curricula.
At the same time, however, we saw common themes across implementations that demonstrate some of the challenges that come with
embedding science learning in casual computer games. First, students in both implementations demonstrated varied levels of what we label
“mindful play”. While some students, particularly those in the Taiwan implementation, carefully read through the objectives, storyline, and
ongoing feedback messages designed to support learning, larger numbers of players appeared to ignore these elements in their enthusiasm
to play the levels. Similarly, there was a shared lack of interest in the scoring systems we designed into the game among players in both
implementations, although some players in both implementations focused intensively on the medal award system, trying to earn higher
(i.e., silver and gold) medals. Each of these ﬁndings may relate to the overall high level of engagement seen in game play, and demonstrate
both the promise and challenges inherent in using casual computer games as a platform for science learning. The high level of motivation
seen by all students reinforces the idea that games can engage a broad spectrum of learners from multiple cultural backgrounds and
interests. However, the observed engagement centered primarily on the real-time game play in SURGE, to the detriment of various visual
scaffolds, feedback messages, and reward systems aimed at moving players beyond tacit understanding of the physics concepts underlying

the game. The continuing challenge in SURGE, and in similar game-based learning projects, is to tightly integrate central game play goals
with the need for and use of game mechanics and design elements that directly impact learning.
Another common theme seen across implementations that presents a challenge to the use of computer games as platforms for science
instruction is that there was a wide range of “time to completion” among students. Some students ﬁnished all the levels in SURGE very
quickly, relative to the rest of the students. From our observations, it appeared that these players fell into two groups: those who largely
ignored the narrative, feedback, and scoring elements of the game, and/or those who seemed to be highly proﬁcient “gamers”. Students who
took longer to ﬁnish the game levels were those who spent more time reading the on-screen information and/or those who needed more
time to master the mechanics of the game. In any instructional intervention (not just ones involving games), there will be variation in
completion time. In SURGE, we are working to include design elements that will help reduce ‘extraneous’ variation in completion rates
related to computer gaming experience and less ‘mindful’ play. To better support students with less gaming experience, we can include
a more heavily structured introduction level to the game that offers a kind of pre-training for students who need it on the basic mechanics of
the game. To encourage more mindful play, we are working, as described previously, on more tightly integrating the narrative, feedback
messages, and rewards system into the central elements of game play to make them relevant and central to success in the game.
With regard to students’ affective response to SURGE, the question of gender is more nuanced. Students in both countries appeared to
misjudge the intended audience of the game: boys in Taiwan liked the game better than girls, but the Taiwan group as a whole believed the
game was better suited for girls; whereas girls in the US study were more positive toward SURGE than the boys, and the US group was of the
opinion that the game was more suitable for boys. It is as if each subgroup (the Taiwan girls and the U.S. boys) expressed a stronger
enjoyment of the game precisely because it is not the type of game the larger group believes they (that subgroup) would enjoy (see Pelletier,
2008, for an analysis on gender construction through expressed gaming preferences). Also noteworthy is that it is not a single gender (boys
or girls) across both groups that are expressing what they perceive as a counter-cultural preference, but rather boys and girls within different
groups. This suggests that while students may be truly perceiving the game as gender-neutral (as evidenced by their survey responses), they
are accessing some differing cues from their respective cultures that are informing their beliefs about what kinds of games they “should”
enjoy, and their opinions express whether or not they agree with that assessment. A full analysis of the country-level cultural differences
between Taiwan and the US that may impact perceptions of, and success with, the SURGE game is beyond the scope of the current study.
However, we believe this is a rich area for future research around educational game use in formalized learning environments.
5.5. Differences in gaming experience, templates, and vocabularies within countries
From our observations, players differ substantially in terms of the game templates and game “vocabularies” that players bring with them
into the game. In some cases, this prior experience provides affordances for learning and in others it provides obstacles. Essentially, the
experiences, templates, and vocabularies that players bring from prior games can be used to orient and motivate them in SURGE (or other
games designed for academic learning) or can produce complications and confusion when our goals or mechanics deviate from these
experiences, templates, and vocabularies. Differences in these prior experiences seem to overshadow differences in gender or country. In
terms of affordances, there are many game design elements and goals that we can incorporate that the vast majority of students seem to
intuitively understand immediately. When our designs can mirror those templates, our path is made much easier in orienting the player in
how to proceed. Similarly, students quickly grasp the ideas and motivation of engaging in a game.
When our pedagogical goals do not parallel standard templates and design vocabularies, however, we need to help students operate in
ways that diverge from their experiences, and we encounter greater challenges than if the players had not played games at all. Our impulse
controls, for example, diverge from the control schemes used in most games. Most games involve holding down a movement key to produce

2192

D.B. Clark et al. / Computers & Education 57 (2011) 2178–2195

a constant velocity in that direction. A few games involve holding down a movement key to produce a constant acceleration in that direction.
Our impulse controls involve discrete pushes of a movement key to apply discrete acceleration bursts in that direction. Most players initially
hold down the keys in the face of no effect because they are accustomed to the ideas of holding down keys to move. At a higher level, players
are accustomed in many games for the real goal to involve quickly getting to the end of the levels, and for this goal to overshadow other goals
of performance along the way.
Complicating this issue is the fact that some players bring more extensive game backgrounds with more robust sets of templates and
vocabularies for thinking about games. These players are more conﬁdent as they approach learning in SURGE, with more robust trial and
error strategies for solving obstacles they encounter. They also are less prone to encountering frustration, both because of their greater prior
experience facilitating progress in the game as well as their self-perception of their competence in games, which buoys them through
challenges that may arise. These same players, however, also tend to view SURGE as a game and seem less likely to reﬂect on what they are
learning. Less experienced game players, particularly girls who have less experience playing digital games, often seem more likely to
approach the challenges in SURGE more methodically and consciously than these more experienced players, but also seem more likely to
withdraw from the experience or to be intimidated by the experience because they don’t label themselves or self-identify as “gamers” and
thus can feel out of their element. While our quantitative ﬁndings show no differences in learning outcomes based on reported gaming
experience, we will continue to watch for more subtle relationships between players’ prior gaming experience and their learning experiences. We are only just beginning to study these issues in SURGE, but they may prove the most important lessons to learn for our own
project and the ﬁeld.
6. Conclusions
In conclusion, we now synthesize the ﬁndings in light of our two driving questions. We ﬁrst discuss the degree to which learning in
SURGE reﬂects academically desirable learning. We then discuss the relative similarities and differences observed in relation to the degree to
which SURGE seems portable between the two countries. We then close with some thoughts about the implications of our ﬁndings in terms
of the potential of conceptually-integrated digital games for science learning.
6.1. Can a conceptually-integrated digital game that overlays popular game-play mechanics with formal physics representations and
terminology support explicit learning about Newtonian mechanics as demonstrated through post-test measures based on assessment items
from the formal discipline (i.e., the force concept inventory)?
To what degree does the learning in SURGE reﬂect academically desirable learning? At the most concrete level, early versions of SURGE
seem to support learning on some core items of the Force Concept Inventory, an assessment instrument developed by university physicists
as measuring important conceptual understanding of Newtonian mechanics. Thus players are making progress on some challenging core
concepts identiﬁed by disciplinary experts. Progress thus far has not been as extensive as we might have hoped, but considering that entire
university level calculus-based courses do not necessarily help students increase their scores on the FCI as dramatically as instructors might
hope (e.g., Hestenes & Halloun, 1995), we feel that any measurable increases for middle school students after roughly an hour playing SURGE
are fairly impressive. Essentially, the Force Concept Inventory was developed by physicists for undergraduate physics students. Undergraduate students who have completed entire traditional physics courses at the undergraduate level often don’t perform that much better
on the post-tests than on the pre-tests (e.g., Hestenes & Halloun, 1995). To assume that we could change students’ performance dramatically
on FCI items, particularly middle school students’ performance, in an hour of game play was probably a bit over-ambitious in hindsight, but
we are encouraged by the progress we have made, particularly in light of the early stages of development of SURGE.
Following this line of reasoning, we think it would be beneﬁcial for future work with SURGE and similar games to develop measures more
sensitive to incremental changes in student understanding. For example, the FCI questions related to interpreting positional dot traces
require a student to (a) interpret the velocity at various time points in one dot trace, (b) interpret the velocity at various points of time on
a second dot trace, and (c) make relative comparisons or syntheses of those sets of information. Rather than having all of the assessment
items represent this level of complexity and cognitive load, it would seem beneﬁcial to include a range of item difﬁculties to increase the
value of the assessment in measuring a range of competencies and understandings. In the case above, we need complex assessment items
like the FCI item described above, but we also need simpler items, such asking students to interpret a single positional dot trace. We thus are
currently developing assessment items similar to those on the FCI but that represent a more gradual range of item difﬁculties while still
focusing on the core concepts measured by the FCI (e.g., some items that focus on interpretation of a single dot trace representation).
Creating a range of item difﬁculties in this manner would allow more sensitive measurement of incremental progress in students’
understanding of disciplinary concepts in light of the shorter curricular time frames of most digital games.
Similarly, we would like to create items that are more sensitive to students’ ability to explicitly connect intuitive understanding and
formal understanding in their answers. As discussed earlier, the FCI items upon which we based our assessment tend to focus more on
intuitive understandings. The FCI was designed purposefully in this manner as a conceptual test to avoid the chance of testing rote
knowledge, but we would like to explore the potential for assessments that explicitly measure students’ ability to explicitly connect intuitive
understanding and formal understanding in their answers as part of our work.
In addition to creating more sensitive assessments, the results of this study also suggest that SURGE needs to provide more extensive
supports for students to help them articulate their intuitive understandings from game play with the explicit formal concepts and representations of the discipline. Squire et al. (2004) found that their learning gains were dependent on the teacher developing curriculum
outside of the game to focus students on these connections. The versions of SURGE in the implementations described in this paper focused
on overlaying the game play mechanics with formal representations and terminology, and resulted in some gains, but more structured
supports to focus students on the phenomena of interest and their relationship to the formal representations and concepts appears
warranted. Current development in SURGE is focusing on integrating just-in-time supports (Gee, 2003, 2007), visual signaling (Mautone &
Mayer, 2001; Nguyen & Meltzer, 2003), and metacognitive supports for prediction and explanation (Champagne et al., 1982; Chi & VanLehn,

1991; Tao & Gunstone, 1999) into the fabric of game play without destroying the “game-ness” of the game play. The next rounds of
implementations will provide insights on the efﬁcacy of these additional design strategies.
Beyond conceptual learning, SURGE also engages students in learning in ways that parallel calls for increased use of scaffolded exploration and inquiry in science. While digital learning games like SURGE do not represent typical inquiry learning environments, they do
engage students in learning about core science concepts (in this case Newtonian mechanics) through exploration, prediction, and observation rather than through rote learning. A growing body of research and scholarship on games and cognition emphasizes cycles of
prediction, observation, and reﬁnement as core mechanics of game play processes (e.g., Salen & Zimmerman, 2003; Squire et al., 2003;
Wright, 2006). Conceptually-integrated games like SURGE offer opportunities to further accentuate these inquiry-related aspects of
game play, which is a driving consideration in the design of the metacognitive supports for prediction and explanation alluded to in the
paragraph above, and which builds on a line of research on prediction, observations, and explanation from the science education and
psychology literatures (e.g., Champagne et al., 1982; Chi & VanLehn, 1991; Tao & Gunstone, 1999). Although SURGE is still in its infancy, we
feel that the results and lessons learned thus far bode well for the potential for games like SURGE to support learning of core science ideas
through inquiry-related processes of exploration.
6.2. How similar or different are the learning and affective experiences of students playing the game in the two countries (i.e., Taiwan and the
United States)?
With respect to our second question, we see remarkable levels of similarity between student reactions, outcomes, and gaming habits in
each country. Across both implementations, students demonstrated high levels of motivation and engagement in playing SURGE,
throughout the implementations. This is a positive ﬁnding that echoes results seen in may other education games studies (e.g., Nelson et al.,
2005; Barab et al., 2007, 2009; Galas, 2006). On a more challenging note, we observed that students within both countries showed wide
variation in the amount of time it took them to complete the game, with some students ﬁnishing very quickly and others taking much
longer. Also, we witnessed varying degrees of ‘mindful’ play across implementations, with some students focusing on the text and visual
scaffolds included in the game and many others paying very little attention to these details. One design detail that did seem to draw the
attention for large numbers of students in both implementation sites was the medal reward system. This very similar extrinsic reward tool
was popular with many participants. Our future game revisions will include an expanded role for the medal system, centered on designing
the medal levels to more closely match speciﬁc components of physics knowledge and application of that knowledge in the game.
That these commonalities and differences in approaches to game play did not result in strong differences in learning is notable. The two
groups are different enough in cultural terms that such differences could be expected (see, for example, the diametrically opposed gendered
response between the groups about whether SURGE is more of a game for boys or girls), but our data regarding learning gains does not
support this view. It may be that, while students play SURGE from perspectives that are largely culturally-speciﬁc, their learning is based
more on the context that SURGE provides, which is common for both groups. In other words, the students regarded SURGE through
divergent cultural lenses, but these lenses did not signiﬁcantly modify their experience of play of the game, nor did it preempt their learning
on the speciﬁc concepts that SURGE highlights.
Overall, the ﬁndings of this study suggest that conceptually-integrated games like SURGE should be fairly portable across multiple
countries, which makes the development time and cost more attractive in light of the potentially larger audiences of students who might be
served through these digital learning games. Future studies and work by our group will explore potential cultural explanations for these
similarities and differences.
6.3. Final thoughts
The short take-home message is that games can be designed to teach science concepts by integrating the science concepts within the
fabric of the game mechanics (i.e., conceptually-integrated games). This requires very careful design, however, as suggested by the ﬁndings
of this study and others such as the Enigmo study (Masson et al., 2011) and work on Supercharged (Squire et al., 2004). Most games may
support students in developing an intuitive understanding of the physics involved, for example, in order to eventually be able to “beat” the
game, but without speciﬁc scaffolds the players won’t necessarily learn anything consciously or explicitly about the physics in a formal
sense. This isn’t surprising considering that people don’t learn formal physics simply through playing soccer or similar physics-based games
in the “real” world. If those same players could be scaffolded in connecting formal concepts and representations to their experiences as they
played soccer in a manner that helped them articulate those connections, however, they might well learn about formal physics by playing
soccer in that context. The challenge in physical settings, however, is in overlaying and connecting those representations and ideas. This is
where digital games like SURGE may provide signiﬁcant affordances in terms of providing scaffolding, signaling, and overlays to make these
connections explicit. Our future work and the future work of other groups will continue to explore these possibilities, particularly in light of
their potential to support students across multiple countries engaging in exploration of challenging core concepts like Newtonian
mechanics.

Promoting Links and Developing Students’ Criteria for Visualizations by Prompting
Judgments of Fidelity
Jennifer L. Chiu
University of California, Berkeley, e-mail: jenchiu@berkeley.edu!
Chemistry students struggle to bridge molecular, symbolic, and molecular representations of chemical phenomena.
For example, students view chemical equations, such as 2H2 + O2 ! 2H2O as math problems to solve instead of
breaking and forming bonds among atoms (Krajcik, 1991). Research demonstrates that powerful visualization tools
can help students add normative ideas about phenomena on a molecular level (Pallant & Tinker, 2004). However,
students need support to connect these ideas to symbolic and everyday ideas, develop criteria for these ideas and sort
and refine the links among ideas to build coherent understandings of complex phenomena (Linn & Eylon, 2006).
Past studies show that students have rich intuitive abilities to critique representations, do well reacting to
representations in design settings but have trouble articulating their ideas (diSessa, 2002). We hope to build upon
these existing capabilities to help students link pre-designed, interactive visualizations to the real world and promote
the development of criteria for these connections.
This poster investigates how prompting students to judge and explain how strongly the visualization relates
to the real world can help students connect molecular visualizations to macroscopic ideas as well as develop criteria
about visualizations. Approximately 140 high school chemistry students from two teachers participated in a weeklong technology-enhanced curriculum unit about chemical reactions. As part of this curriculum, students interacted
with molecular visualizations from Molecular Workbench and greenhouse effect visualizations in NetLogo. After
each visualization step, students were prompted to judge the visualization as “not at all related”, “somewhat related”
or “very related” to the real world and then explained their choice. Significant gains from pretest to posttest items
demonstrate students made connections among molecular and macroscopic levels. Analyses of students’ embedded
explanations show that many students judge visualizations as related to the real world because of particular
examples, such as specific chemicals or reactions. Many students also articulate ideas about the fidelity, usability,
and learnability of the visualizations. Overall, the data suggests that students make connections from the
visualizations to the real world but but need support to build from their rich intuitive ideas and develop more
sophisticated criteria for visualizations.!

SURGE: Intended and Unintended Learning in Digital Games
Douglas B. Clark, Brian C. Nelson, Cynthia M. D’Angelo, Kent Slack, and Mario Martinez
Vanderbilt University and Arizona State University
Well-designed video games can support learners in building accurate intuitive understandings of the concepts and
processes embedded in the games due to the situated and enacted nature of good game design (Gee, 2007). Most
commercial games fall short as platforms for learning, however, because they do not help students articulate and
connect their evolving intuitive understandings to more explicit formalized structures that would support transfer of
knowledge to other contexts. In Thought and Language, Vygotsky (1986) discusses the potential for leveraging
intuitive understandings from everyday experience ("spontaneous concepts") with instructed scientific concepts to
build robust understandings. The SURGE project (Scaffolding Understanding by Redesigning Games for Education)
focuses on integrating and overlaying popular gameplay dynamics with formal physics representations and
visualizations (see Figure 1 (a) for a snapshot). The design combines cognitive processing-based design and sociocognitive scripting with design principles and mechanics of popular commercial video games such as Mario Galaxy,
Switchball, Tiger Woods PGA Tour, Orbz, and Portal.
The first SURGE study analyzed 24 university students playing SURGE. The pre-post test data support the
potential of games for learning, but also underscore their potential to reinforce alternative conceptions. The game
actually resulted in a significant pre-post test decrease ("2 = 4.75, p = .029) in correct answers for one question by
unintentionally focusing students’ attention on another physics relationship (we had not yet added all of the intended
functionality to the interface relevant to projectile motion and the independence of the x and y components of an
object’s velocity), but the students demonstrated significant (p = .037) gains on the rest of the posttest. In postinterviews, students’ understanding of the concepts and vector representations demonstrate the ways in which
students’ ideas evolve during the game. The results suggest that players learn about the formal instructed concepts in
a manner that transfers to Force Concept Inventory items (Hestenes, Wells, & Swackhamer, 1992; Jackson, 2007),
but the results also caution that the ideas that students take away from games aren’t always the ones intended by the

designers. A second study in November 2009 will analyze 330 students in Taiwan and Minnesota playing SURGE.
Students will be randomly assigned to conditions that display or remove the overlaid vector representations.
Interview data will explore how the students make use of the vector representations and visualizations within the
game as well as the ways in which the game connects with students’ other interests and identities outside of school.

How Do Interactive Graphing Tools Help Students Interpret
Virtual Experiments about Car Collisions?
Kevin W. McElhaney
University of California, Berkeley Graduate School of Education
This study examines how experimentation using a visualization featuring coordinated animated and graphical
representations of motion can help students reach sophisticated insights about car collisions. Airbags: Too Fast, Too
Furious? is a one-week high school physics investigation about airbag safety that addresses students’ understanding
of motion graphs. The design of Airbags builds on research that recommends using visual representations to scaffold
inquiry-based learning (Quintana et al, 2004), particularly investigations concerning motion (White, 1993). Airbags
incorporates dynamic visualizations that aim to help students understand events in a car collision that occur too
quickly to be observed in real time. The visualizations present coordinated animated and graphical representations
that are each designed to help support students’ understanding of the other (Ainsworth, 1999; Kozma, 2003).
I designed the final Airbags visualization (Figure 2a) to model the crash test videos (Figure 2b) students
observe in previous activities. Students use this visualization to experiment with three motion variables to
investigate what factors put drivers at increased risk for injury. The visualization allows students to categorize trial
outcomes and view the graphs of multiple trials to aid in the interpretation and comparison of trial outcomes.

Students (n = 168) in five diverse high schools studied Airbags in dyads. Students responded to pretests and
posttests on motion graphs and embedded assessments about the airbags situation. We also videorecorded the
experimentation of 12 dyads, capturing their discussions and gestures during the experimentation activity.
Significant pretest to posttest gains on understanding of motion graphs demonstrate that students were able to
generalize knowledge about motion graphs in Airbags to other situations. Reponses to embedded assessments show
that many students achieved a sophisticated understanding of the airbags situation that involved the role of threshold

SURGE: Integrating Vygotsky’s Spontaneous and Instructed
Concepts in a Digital Game?

In Thought and Language, Vygotsky discusses the potential for leveraging intuitive
understandings from everyday experience ("spontaneous concepts") with “instructed”
scientific concepts to build robust understandings. The question remains whether or not
the intuitive spontaneous concepts players develop in through computer games can be
successfully leveraged into robust instructed concepts in a manner that transfers to
academic assessments and across domains recognized as central by the scientific
disciplines themselves. This poster presents data from early studies with the SURGE
video game, where students demonstrated significant learning across multiple items of a
posttest based on the Force Concept Inventory, suggesting that the sequence and structure
of the models and representations designed in the SURGE game are effective in changing
how students think about the formal instructed concepts. However, care must be taken to
ensure that the ideas that students take away from the game are the ones intended.

Research Goals and Theoretical Framework
School science, with its focus on explicit formalized knowledge structures, seldom connects with students' tacit
intuitive understandings. Interestingly, many commercial video games focus on physics, ecology, engineering,
and other critical STEM concepts at their core. Furthermore, commercial video games are exceptionally
successful at helping learners build accurate intuitive understandings of the concepts and processes embedded in
the games due to the situated and enacted nature of good game design (Gee, 2003, 2004, 2007). As SURGE
advisor James Gee explains, good game design is inherently about problem solving. According to Gee,
however, these games fall short because they do not help students articulate and connect their evolving tacit
intuitive understandings into larger explicit formalized structures allowing knowledge transfer and application
across broader contexts. In Thought and Language, Vygotsky (1986) discusses the potential for leveraging
intuitive understandings from everyday experience ("spontaneous concepts") with instructed scientific concepts
to build robust understandings. The question remains whether or not the intuitive spontaneous concepts
developed in games can actually be successfully leveraged into robust instructed concepts in the format and
terminology of academic assessment and across domains recognized as central by the scientific disciplines.

Game Context and Data
SURGE (Scaffolding Understanding by Redesigning Games for Understanding) investigates design principles
for connecting students' intuitive “spontaneous concepts” about kinematics and Newtonian mechanics into
formalized “instructed concepts.” SURGE integrates research on conceptual change, cognitive processing-based
design, and socio-cognitive scripting with design principles and mechanics of popular commercial video games
such as Mario Galaxy, Switchball, Orbz, and Portal to support students’ articulation and connection of their
evolving tacit intuitive understandings into larger explicit formalized structures allowing knowledge transfer
and application across broader contexts relevant to Newtonian mechanics. SURGE incorporates the game play
designs of these games in levels alternating between marble “travel” and marble “launching” in the context of a
space-based adventure. Each level involves specific challenges directly linked to physics concepts. To complete
these challenges, students need to learn and apply many principles related to mechanics (e.g., impulse, inertia,
vector addition, elastic collision, gravity, velocity, acceleration, free-fall, mass, force, projectile motion).Each
level highlights one or two topics, and levels allow students to connect the concepts together and to see the
relations that exist among the topics. For example, the initial levels do not include gravity or friction. However,
as the game progresses, gravity and then friction are gradually introduced. This approach allows students to gain
a firm grasp of a concept before new concepts are introduced.

Assessment Methods
Assessment in SURGE involves standard experimental design in terms of random assignment of participants
within classrooms across experimental groups. In addition, SURGE is conducting formative quantitative and
qualitative analyses of student learning during development/pilot-testing phases. Student learning in SURGE is
measured (a) in terms of intuitive understanding of "spontaneous concepts" through students’ performance in

the actual game levels and (b) in terms of formal understanding of "instructed concepts" through items from the
Force Concept Inventory (FCI) (Hestenes, Wells, & Swackhamer, 1992; Jackson, 2007). In-game performance
is measured via data recorded as students employ concepts of velocity, force, and gravity to spheres of varying
mass through a series of obstacle courses. We are also utilizing visualization tools to map connections between
students’ performance and choices in the game (intuitive concepts) with the formal academic assessments
(instructed concepts).

Data and Results
The first SURGE study took place in summer 2009. We analyzed 24 undergraduate and graduate students
playing SURGE. A paired-samples t-test was performed on the pre/post items and revealed a significant gain
from pre to post (p = .037). One of the largest gains on an individual item was the one about vector addition.
The second SURGE study involved 180 eighth grade students in Taiwan that showed significant gains in 3 test
items dealing with Newton’s First Law. The gains observed are not dependent on gaming experience and apply
to both genders. The items in which gains were observed are those most closely aligned with the experience of
controlling the player-object in SURGE. These items deal with things in SURGE players do, rather than see.
The third SURGE study focused on the complexity of formal physics representations to optimize student
learning about the physics concepts and representations. The study involved 138 undergraduates enrolled in an
introductory calculus-based physics course at a large university. Students in “full” condition (components and
resultant velocity vector) did better on vector addition problems (76.7% versus 69.5%), and the post-test
(average gain of 11.0% versus 6.8%) than those in “simplified” condition (only resultant velocity vector).

Significance
The results of these first studies suggest that the sequence and structure of the models and representations
designed in the SURGE game are effective in changing how students think about the formal instructed concepts
in a manner that transfers to certain items from the Force Concept Inventory, but care must be taken to ensure
that the ideas that students take away from the game are the ones intended by the designers. In post-gameplay
interviews, students remark that the game helps them understand how to improve their answers on the posttest
even though they weren’t consciously thinking about their learning while they were playing the game. Ongoing
work will focus on the balance of guidance and freedom in the gameplay mechanics, the structuring of
mechanics to focus students on key concepts, as well as on the nature of representations that best support
learning in a gaming context.

Abstract: This poster presentation revives Dewey’s “reflective thinking” framework to
inform the design of problems for virtual environment-based assessments of content and
inquiry. After describing “reflective thinking” and illuminating a conceptualization of what is
a problem, we show how we are using the “reflective thinking” framework to inform the
design of problems in our SAVE Science virtual environment assessment modules.

Virtual Learning Environments (VLEs)
Since digital media are increasingly becoming a part of students’ lives in and out of school, VLEs and
supporting technologies can be woven into the fabric of their everyday school science experiences to prompt
reflective thinking. It has been shown that contemporary education using virtual methods of inquiry can play a
significant role in substituting for physical experimentation in K-12, because they obviate the need for
expensive equipment and minimize the impact of deficient training for teachers on how to implement inquiry
(Ketelhut and Nelson, in press; Nelson & Ketelhut, 2007). Furthermore, it has also been shown that virtual
environments have the advantage of giving students time to ‘reflect’ on their course of action (Schank & Cleary,
1995). But, what are the design heuristics necessary for prompting reflective thinking? In this paper, we propose
a framework for designing problem-based VLEs to promote reflection based on Dewey’s Reflective Thinking
Framework (1910). We discuss how this framework was used to design modular assessments in an NSF-funded
project, called Situated Assessment in Virtual Environment for Science Content and Inquiry (SAVE Science).

Reflective Thinking
“Reflective thinking,” according to Dewey (1910), is “[a]ctive, persistent, and careful consideration of any
belief or supposed form of knowledge in the light of the grounds that support it, and the further conclusions to
which it tends” (p. 6). Reflective thinking is part of the critical thinking process of analyzing and making
judgments about what has occurred or what problem has been posed. Reflective thinking ranges from simple
acceptance of a judgment to deep inquiry into posed problems.
Dewey developed and articulated the four steps required for reflective thinking, or problem solving.
The four steps are: 1) identify or define the problem; 2) suggest solution; 3) collect evidence; and 4) conclude.
Although the steps are enumerated, reflective thinking (problem solving) does not necessarily occur in that
order or in a linear fashion. One does not have to complete the first step in order to proceed to the second. The
formal steps involved in reflective thinking are less important than a sequence that results in the solution to the
specific problem. Furthermore, during reflective thinking the problem solver goes back and forth through
general stages before settling on a solution.

Reflective Thinking Problem Design
Problems that arise from experiences can be arrayed on a continuum with simple problems (easy task) to
complex problems (hard task) as extremities. Simple problems are those that typically appear in classroom
science and mathematics and can be solved easily. The simplest of all problems would be solved progressing
through each of Dewey’s four reflective thinking stages only once before a conclusion is made. However,
problems in life are never this easy. Complex problems can be difficult social problems, like hunger and
poverty, and are hard to solve. As problems become increasingly more complex, the problem solving pathway
through the reflective thinking stages can occur multiple times before a conclusion is drawn.
According to Dewey (1910), experiences are imbued with rich sources of problems. He believed that a
problem causes a “state of perplexity, hesitation, [or] doubt” (p. 9) creates a tension mental unrest
(disequilibrium) and suspense. This imbalance was a precondition for inquiry and reflective thinking. Indeed,
the perception of a disturbance “would lead to an act of search or investigation directed toward bringing to light
further facts which serve to corroborate or to nullify the suggested belief” (p. 9). Dewey assumed that this
tension was often vague and not clearly focused. In fact, his first state of reflective thinking was a search
performed within the environment for information that would clarify the problem.
What are the characteristics of a good problem that creates this mental unrest? Drawing on Dewey’s
notion of genuine problems (1910), Polanyi (1957) suggests that good problems should: 1) hint that there is a

known but hidden solution; 2) result in the amount of effort matching the reward of finding that solution; and 3)
have clues that hint at or are part of the solution. Dewey (1910) further recommended that the problem should
be based in a story, and should have interest for the solver. Foreshadowing Csikszentmihalyi’s concept of flow
years later (1990), Polanyi (1957) cautions that the “logical gap” (the difference between what is known and
what is needed to be known to solve the problem) is a major factor to be considered in designing the problem.

Applying Reflecting Thinking Problem Design to SAVE Science
The SAVE Science project is designing and implementing a series of virtual environment-based assessment
adventures (or quests) used for assessing both science content and inquiry in middle grades. To do this, we are
creating assessment quests for students to solve using knowledge they have gained in their middle school
science classroom. We are using the above framework to guide our design of our assessment quests. “Sheep
trouble” is the first quest that we designed to assess student understanding of concepts of adaptation and
structure/function. First, to create a problem with a knowable but hidden solution, we have students greeted bya
medieval farmer who asks them to help him find a scientific solution for why his new sheep are dying. His
brother and many of the townsfolk think that there is no findable solution, but he is convinced that there is and
that the student-scientist can help him find it. Second, we are supporting student effort as they progress through
the problem by foregrounding relevant elements and events in the virtual environment. We are doing this by
highlighting computer agents and other interactive items. Third, students are provided clues to the solution
through posters, computer agents, and the design of the actual world. For example, a poster shows that the new
sheep come from a very different locale (flat, snowy island) from the current farm (hilly, rocky, and dry). By
exploring, students also discover that to find the best grass to eat, the sheep need to climb the hill. Finally, the
problem is firmly based in a narrative that includes helping the farmer save his sheep from the town executioner
who is under orders to destroy them unless proof that they are not ‘bad magic’ is found.

SAVE Science Pilot
A pilot was conducted in May 2009 in a mid-Atlantic school. Twenty students participated in the sheep trouble
module. While this was primarily a usability implementation, we were also evaluating our problem design
framework. Using students’ own words (see table 1), we discovered that our problem narrative was interesting.
All students felt that the solution was discoverable as witnessed by their engagement with the project. Students
used the provided clues to solve the problem and when questioned, pointed to those clues in their rationale.
Finally, students indicated that our ‘logical gap’ might have been too small as many students asked for more
complexity or difficulty in future modules.

ABSTRACT
Technology offers many opportunities for educators to support teaching, learning and assessment. This paper
introduces a project to design and implement a virtual environment (SAVE Science) intended to assess (not
teach) middle school students’ knowledge and use of scientific inquiry through two modules developed around
curriculum taught in middle schools in Pennsylvania, U.S.A. We explore how the concept of ‘presence’ supports
these efforts, as well as how Piaget’s theory of developmental stages can be used as a lens to understand whether
these students achieved presence in the modules. Findings are presented from a study looking at 154 middle
school students’ perceived sense of presence in a virtual world developed for the SAVE Science research project
as demonstrated through a post module survey and a post module discussion with their teacher. Age and gender
differences are explored. In addition we use content analysis, as described by Slater and Usoh (1993), of student
talk in the post module discussion transcripts to identify levels of “presence.” In the end, participating seventh
grade students demonstrated achieving some level of presence, while the sixth grade students did not.

Introduction
As we move further into the twenty-first century, technology opportunities allow researchers to consider many ways
in which technology can be exploited to support teaching, learning, and assessment of learning. (Gee, 2003) Most
research on educational uses of technologies focuses on how they are used to teach, rather than on how they are used
to assess knowledge or application of knowledge. The Situated Assessment using Virtual Environments for Science
Inquiry and Content (SAVE Science) research project is one that is focused on assessment rather than learning. The
SAVE Science project is designing and implementing a series of virtual environment-based assessments of middle
school science content. Students engage individually with a contexualized problem and use knowledge learned in the
classroom to solve it. However, in order for students to fully engage in the tasks presented in the SAVE Science
modules, we hypothesize that the more they perceive themselves as part of the story, the more likely they will
actively engage in the activities. Thus, the students need to perceive they are “present” in the story/module.
The concept of ‘presence’ has been the subject of research and discussion for over 30 years. For many scholars,
presence has its roots in symbolic interactionism, or how we make meaning of new experiences based on prior
experiences with similar events/items/ideas (Mead & Morris, 1934, Blumer, 1969), and in social psychology theories
of interpersonal communication, as in Goffman’s concept of copresence, or how we acknowledge the presence of
others nearby (1959). But others credit the writings of J.J. Gibson (1979) on perceptual learning theory, which
suggests close connections between observation and action, and that information is what we sense and how it is
interpreted.
The definition of ‘presence’ ranges from a sense of participation and involvement (Sheridan, 1992, p. 121), to “the
sense of being in an environment” (Steuer, 1993, p. 75), to “the perceptual illusion of non-mediation” (Lombard &
Ditton, 1997, p. 4) to a subjective sense of being in a place (Slater, 2003/2004). It is unclear from the definitions
whether the technology being discussed is the same across references, or if the populations included in the samples
are comparable. Research on the concept of presence has included all types of media, including letters, television,
telephones, teleconferencing systems, immersive VE, and virtual games (Daft & Lengel, 1984, Lombard & Ditton,
1997). Steuer (1993) suggests the relationship between vividness and interactivity on a graph (interactivity on the xaxis and vividness on the y-axis) with the book being low on both scales, Star Trek’s Holodeck as being high on both
scales, and a range of other technologies located in the scatter plot in between (p. 90). With the advent of commercial
Multi-User Virtual Environments such as World of Warcraft and Second Life, Delgarno and Lee (2010) suggest that
presence be defined as “being there together.” But what is ‘presence’?

Initially this paper explores definitions of presence put forth over the last 20 years, and how these apply to middle
school students rather than adults. Second, we introduce the reader to the SAVE Science project. Third, we present
preliminary findings from a SAVE Science study exploring whether participating students achieved presence through
the VE modules as demonstrated through an online survey and a post-module discussion with their teacher, and if
there is a difference in perceived presence based on gender or age, using Piaget’s levels of development as a lens.

Defining presence within virtual environments
Historically, presence has been discussed in terms of how an individual’s interactions with a virtual reality are
depicted in the virtual environment (VE). The key factors considered important to presence were sensory, perceptual,
and social (see definitions below). The type/design of the environment was extremely important to facilitate
development of presence or not. Table 1 summarizes several papers on these factors. Heeter (1992), in addressing
Virtual Reality (VR) technologies, used the term “dimensions” to define presence and considered the personal (or
how much you perceived/believed you were part of the VR), social (or how much you perceived/believed “others” in
the VR interacted with you), and environmental (or how much you perceived/believed the environment reacted to
you as part of the scene) aspects of interaction in the VR. Steuer (1993), discussing how VR is technologically rather
than experientially focused, suggested two dimensions of presence: vividness and interactivity. The more vivid the
VR environment and the more one could interact with the environment and characters, the more likely one would
experience the sensation of being in that environment. One could argue that these claims are complementary,
because in order to perceive/believe you are “in” a VR, you need to sense (see, hear, feel) that environment in a way
that is real, and you need interact with characters and objects found within that environment. But being in a VR is
very different today from what it was in the early 1990s.
Lombard and Ditton (1997) chose to define presence by considering three causes of it. First, they discussed form
variables based on sensory richness, as defined by Steuer (1995). The more senses that were induced to participate,
the more likely the user would achieve a sense of presence through the medium. The addition of rich natural voice
and rich visual sensory stimuli produced a greater sense of presence than one or the other alone. Next were content
variables where the responses to the user were perceived as being by another social entity, and not the medium or
computer. The more the computer used the natural language of the users, the more likely the users would “believe”
they were interacting with another social being. Lastly, they described the user variables, which included past
experience with the medium, age, gender and personality. These are ones we will use later in looking at middle
school students’ reactions to SAVE Science modules.

Witmer and Singer (1998) suggested similar concepts for how presence is achieved, identifying the importance of the
ability of the user to concentrate on the VE to the exclusion of all other stimuli. Schubert, Friedmann, and
Regenbrecht (2001) supported this by saying, “…the sense of presence should involve two components: the sense
that we are located in and acting from within the VE, and the sense that we are concentrating on the VE and ignoring
the real environment.” (p. 269) As noted by Mikropoulos, “researchers agree with the description of presence as ‘the
sense of being there’.” (2006, p. 197)
In reviewing MUVEs, such as World of Warcraft and Second Life where players interact with others worldwide,
Delgarno and Lee (2010) explored the relationship between immersion and presence, offering a model of learning in
MUVEs with distinguishing characteristics of MUVEs being representational fidelity and learner interaction (See
Delgarno & Lee, 2010, p. 15 for the model). They proposed that representational fidelity, as defined in their model,
incorporated aspects of both single-user and multi-user environments, including Brna’s concept of social fidelity,
which combined social familiarity and social reality (Brna, 1999). From these concepts, they posited that presence in
a MUVE is “being there together” because people worldwide participate. They also suggested this is true about
single-user VEs.
Reviewing these various definitions, considerations and conditions, one can conclude that achieving presence in all
kinds of VE depends on the ability of the user/player to seriously concentrate on what is happening in the VE, close
out any competing distractions from the real world, and believe the avatar they choose/use is actually them
interacting with other avatars and characters in the VE. All of this depends on the level of perceived immersion into
the virtual world, and the level of interactivity made available to the user/player.

Presence, age, and gender of participant
Another concept to consider is the targeted populations in these studies. For instance, Gibson’s work studied how
adult pilots land planes using landmarks to afford them a sense of distance. The articles reviewed above either did
not specify the age range of their sample, or they used college-age students as the subjects (Witmer & Singer, 1998).
However, in most cases gender was not identified.
How individuals react to/in a virtual world and/or perceive themselves as “being there” or “being there together”
(i.e., present) in the world may also depend on the development stage of the users/players. Lombard and Ditton
(1997) hinted at this concept when they suggested the “user variable” that included age of the user. They referenced
Turkle (1984) who suggested that adults think of computers as machines, while children “enter into ‘social
relationships’ with the machine in which they [get] competitive, angry, and even vindictive” (p. 47). Taking cues
from Piaget’s theory (1953) of development of children’s understanding of their world, it seems probable that stage
of development is a crucial variable in development of presence in a VE. Piaget considered children ages 7-12 to be
at the “Concrete Operations” stage of development, where thoughts are more logical. At this stage, children are
developing the ability to classify information, problem-solve in a concrete, systematic way, but are unable to think
abstractly. Children older than 12 (through adulthood) are classified as in the “Formal Operations” stage, described
as thinking more abstractly, incorporating formal logic where they could generate multiple hypotheses and possible
outcomes, and thinking less tied to concrete reality.
Research studies with children as participants mainly focused on the use of digital games. (e.g. Squire, 2002; Facer,
2003; Fromme, 2003; Virvou & Katsionis, 2006; Kim, Park, & Baek, 2008; Papastergiou, 2009) However, these
authors discussed the impact of serious games on student achievement without studying how the students perceived
their “being there” in the virtual game environment. Squire (2002) concentrated on discussing how games are
perceived in education, while unpacking gameplay through learning science, but again not discussing the ages of
users. Others concentrated on such aspects as skill, communication and working with others, problem-solving, and
mathematical development (Facer, p. 5), games as part of children’s culture (Fromme, 2003), usability and likability
of games by children (Virvou & Katsiounis, 2006), meta-cognitive strategies used by 9th graders (Kim, Park & Baek,
2008), and games in high school computer science class (Papastergiou, 2009). None of these studies considered
Piaget’s developmental stages of the participants, or the issue of presence.
Gender is another consideration. According to Lenhart, Kahne, Middaugh, Macgill, Evans, and Vitak (2008), 99% of
boys and 94% of girls play video games. (p. 2). From a sample of 1102 teens ages 12-17 they report 65% of the daily
55

gamers were boys, and 35% were girls. What is not clear is whether and how middle school age boys or girls
experience or express presence as manifested through game play.

Design and Implementation of Modules for Assessing Science in Middle School
SAVE Science is a five-year, National Science Foundation-supported research project in which we are developing a
series of VE-based game modules to test whether a VE can be used to assess middle school students’ understanding
of scientific content and inquiry. The typical assessment of science knowledge in the United States uses objective
type test items tied to a scenario presented in written format with minimal pictures. These types of tests are expected
to assess content knowledge, but indeed also test for reading skills. Hence, they are difficult for children who cannot
read, are not reading on grade level, or have limited English proficiency as an English language learner (ELL). The
SAVE Science project is investigating whether students perform better on situated, context-based assessments as
opposed to the traditional text-based tests that test reading skills as much as science.
The SAVE Science assessments are designed to assess individual student’s understanding of local district middle
grades (11-14 year olds) curricula. Working with district administrators and teachers, we have identified and are
designing around concepts that are currently not well-assessed on state and district high stakes tests. Our design
process has two interconnected aspects: the problem scenario that tests individual concepts and the instructional
game design which gives context to the problem scenario and provides immersion and presence for the participants.
At the time of this study, we have designed two SAVE Science assessment modules for seventh graders based in a
medieval world called Scientopolis (see Figure 1). Students work individually through the modules because they are
designed as assessments, or tests, where students do not collaborate with other students to solve the problem, just as
they would in a test in school.

Figure 1. The town of Scientopolis

Figure 2. Sheep Trouble overview
In both assessment modules, students are met by a local computer-based character who presents the problem scenario
to students and creates the motivational prompt for them. In the first module, “Sheep Trouble,” students are asked to
56

help a farmer find evidence to support a scientific hypothesis for why his new flock of sheep is not doing as well as
his original flock. As an additional motivation, students are told that if they fail to find scientific evidence for the
problem, the town’s executioner will execute the new sheep to prevent their “bad magic” from spreading to other
farms. This module requires students to apply their understanding of beginning speciation and aspects of scientific
inquiry to help the farmer with this problem. They can collect evidence from two characters, multiple sheep and
environmental clues using various tools (see Figure 2).
The second module, “Weather Trouble,” assesses understanding of weather fronts and different aspects of scientific
inquiry. Similar to Sheep Trouble, students are met by a farmer when they enter Scientopolis and asked to help him
save his town where a long-lasting drought is sending townspeople away due to fear that the drought is never going
to end. Students are asked to investigate the causes of the drought, and to predict if the drought will end soon.
Students have a different array of tools to access and a different part of Scientopolis to explore (see Figure 3).

Figure 3. Weather Trouble overview
Students are given a class period to explore, interact with other computer agents, virtual tools, and objects in the
world in order to form a hypothesis of the cause of the problem. Once they have solved the problem, they report back
to Farmer Brown.

Problem definition, Research questions, and contribution
SAVE Science is a virtual environment designed to assess middle school students’ knowledge and application of
science inquiry to a problem set in context. While not designed specifically with “presence” in mind, we
hypothesized that the more students perceive themselves as part of the story, the more likely they will actively
engage in the activities. This project adds to the literature on virtual games by addressing games for assessment, and
by looking at how middle grade students experience and report presence in these environments. Through the
implementation of SAVE Science assessment modules in sixth and seventh grade classrooms, we asked the
following questions:
 How do middle grade students respond to an online survey about their experience with a SAVE Science module
compared to a group discussion of that experience with their teacher?
 Is there a difference between boys and girls in their responses based on prior experience with console or
computer games?
 Is there a difference in perceived presence based on age or grade level as demonstrated through an online survey
and/or discussion with their teacher, using Piaget’s theory as an interpretive lens?

Methods
Protocol
This study was a pre-experimental design, as no “experiment” was conducted (Gay, Mills, & Airasian, 2009).
Participating students were from two different schools and teachers. Prior to participating in SAVE Science, parents
and students submitted signed consent forms to participate in the project, and to be audio and video recorded.
57

Teachers underwent eight hours of professional development that covered the science topics underlying the modules,
the motivation for SAVE Science, plus the logistics and details of implementation. Students were asked to complete
a pre-survey that asked them about prior experience with computer and console games, and then completed an
introductory module to help them become familiar with the game interface. Following that, teachers implemented
one of the two assessment modules, Sheep Trouble (seventh grade class) or Weather Trouble (sixth grade class), with
their students. A post-module survey that specifically asked students about their experiences/perceptions of
“presence” while completing the module (items were based on Lombard & Ditton, 1997) completed the
implementation. Students were asked to participate in a post-module discussion with the teacher that was based on
four questions:
 What was the problem you were asked to solve?
 How did you go about solving the problem?
 How was this like being a scientist?
 How was this like or different from taking a test?
These questions were important because the first two indicate what the student thought they were doing in the
module, the third indicates what the students believe scientists do, and the fourth indicates how the students
interpreted the module as a test or not. In this paper we concentrate on responses to the first two questions. All
conversations were recorded and transcribed for accuracy. Content analysis of the transcripts was completed looking
for evidence of “being there” language, including the use of the first-person ‘I,’ ‘me,’ or ‘we,’ along with other
language that demonstrated the students were engaged, immersed, and interactive in the VE (e.g., ‘he said’ or ‘she
said’).

Site and Sample
In spring 2010, the SAVE Science project was implemented in seven schools, three in a large urban school district,
and four suburban/rural schools outside the urban school district, all in the United States. Middle school science
teachers were invited to participate, and ultimately, seven teachers implemented at least one module with their
students. Since this was an assessment, teachers implemented each module on unique timeframes depending on when
they taught the topics assessed in the modules. The four teachers in the suburban/rural schools were asked to audio
record their post-module discussion. Among these four, only two completed the assignment on time and are the focus
of this paper.
From these two teachers, a total of 154 students participated (66 male, 88 female). One teacher included five classes
of students in her seventh grade science classroom (46 male, 56 female) after they completed the first module (Sheep
Trouble), and the other teacher included two sixth grade classes (20 males, 32 females) after they completed the
second module (Weather).

Results
Findings from the pre and post module surveys
We asked students about their prior experience with either computer or console games to give a sense of their prior
gaming experience in case this factor impacts their sense of presence in a game as suggested by Lombard and Ditton
(1997). From the questions on gaming habits in the pre-module survey, students reported varying levels of prior
experience with either computer or console games. Table 2 presents the results related to use of computer games.
The results are presented in terms of the numbers and percentage of males or females, by grade level, responding to
the question.
The data in Table 2 were analyzed by a two-way ANOVA (gender by grade). This produced a significant main effect
for grade (F(1,148) = 10.48, p = .001, hp2 = .020), a non-significant main effect for gender (F(1,148) = 10.48, p = .097),
and a marginally significant interaction (F(1,148) = 4.02, p = .047, hp2 = .026). As shown in Table 2, the seventh grade
students demonstrate a greater prior use of computer games compared to the sixth graders. Follow-up analyses for
the interaction indicated that female students had a significantly higher mean when compared to the male students at
the sixth grade (t = 2.28, p = .029), but that the two groups did not differ in the seventh grade.

This information tells us that the majority of these students had some experience with computer games, with only
18% overall having no experience at all. It is important to point out that the term ‘games’ was broadly defined and
examples were not requested.
Table 3 presents the results related to use of console games. Again, the results are presented in terms of the numbers

A two-way ANOVA (grade by gender) found a highly significant main effect for gender with a large effect size
(F(1,148)=37.015, p = .000; hp2 = .2). Neither the main effect for grade nor the interaction were significant. As
demonstrated in Table 3, more boys reported playing console games, with fewer boys indicating never using console
games (Sixth grade=5%, Seventh grade=2%) compared with girls (Sixth grade=16%, Seventh grade=7%), and more
boys reported using them daily (Sixth grade=55%, Seventh grade=49%). Girls did hold their own in playing console
games monthly or weekly, but clearly boys play console games more often.

Level of Use

Since responses to the survey items related to presence in the game are not intervally scaled, a chi-square analysis
was used. Answers to the four most important items in the post module survey questions about whether students
experienced presence in the game seem to indicate their experiences were mixed, and are presented in Table 4. The
first question asked to what extent students had a sense of ‘being there’ inside the Scientopolis game module.
Overall, 55% of all the students indicated some level of ‘being there’. A chi-square analysis was used to compare
males and females in reporting presence, based on the previous analysis which showed gender to be more significant
than grade. In this case, there were no significant differences found (χ2(2)=3.876, p<.275). A second chi-square
analysis used to compare sixth and seventh grades found significant differences (χ2(2)= 12.642, p = .005), where
seventh graders were more likely to indicate a sense of ‘being there’, while sixth graders were more likely to indicate
they ‘felt they were all together in the game with others in Scientopolis’.

59

A correlation analysis was used to determine whether there was a relationship between prior use of either console or
computer games and responses to whether students experienced presence in the assessment modules. This analysis
used all 10 items specific to presence in the online survey correlated with responses to use of computer games and
console games. There were no significant correlations between prior use of console games and students responses to
being present in the SAVE Science modules. There were several significant relationships between prior use of
computer games and responses to a sense of ‘being there’ inside Scientopolis (r= .172, p = .001), interacted with
others in Scientopolis (r = .164, p = .002), made eye contact with others in Scientopolis (r = .172, p = .001), and
smiled in response to someone in Scientopolis (r=.206, p =- .000). Students who used computer games prior to a
SAVE Science module were more likely to indicate they acted as if they were present in the game environment.

Findings from the post-module discussion
The post discussion session was intended to assist the teachers’ attempts to connect the VE module back to
classroom activities and discussions for the students. In this post module discussion, the teacher asked a number of
questions about the students’ experience in the game module (see 3.0 above). Analysis of this discussion used the
schema presented by Slater and Usoh (1993), where the ‘student talk’ was analyzed for iterations of first (I, we),
second (you), or third (he, she, it, they) person references to experiences in the VE. The more first or second person
references made, the more likely the students identified with the VE, hence more likely ‘presence’ had been
achieved.
While several of the students discussed issues of logistics in moving around in the VE, especially the second class of
sixth graders who seemed to fixate on the logistics and game design features, overall students participating in the
post-module discussion indicated their actions were akin to “being there” in the VE with Farmer Brown and other
characters in both modules. Specifically, in response to the questions about what was the question/problem, and how
did they try to solve the problem, students used the words “I,” “you” and “we” often to describe their actions in the
module, along with phrases such as “he said” and “she said.” Two-thirds of the total comments included such
utterances, with the remaining one-third comments merely stating facts to answer direct questions by the teacher.
Students’ using these terms suggest they had identified with the VE enough to self identify with their avatar so they
were “talking” or “interacting” with the characters in the VE. Table 5 summarizes the types of “talk” from the
students.

Examples of students “being there” include:
Children who worked with module 1, Sheep Trouble, said things like (seventh graders, ages 12-13):
“I talked with the farmer and the townspeople.”
“I went to like all the sheep and I noticed that all like the new ones were really skinny but then like all the
older ones were like really fat.”
“You can measure it’s weight, height, if it’s a male or female.”
“You’re solving someone’s problem.”
“We used the tools to help us.”
Children who worked with the module 2, Weather Module, said things like (sixth graders, ages 11-12):
“I went to the lady with the newspapers and I talked to each other person…”
“I went to each town and used the sci tools and I recorded like the temperature and wind speed.”
“I like went to the newspaper lady. I wrote down like the information on the newspapers. I would write the
heading and write down the wind speed.”
“You had to figure out why Scientopolis was having a drought and you had to go to each different place and
figure it out.”
60

“When you’re at Shoretown, there’s a police officer saying that it doesn’t rain most of the day.”
“He asked if was some magic, and I said that no it wasn’t. I said that they were gonna get rain soon.”
Factual statements were related to facts about the modules (e.g., it was raining, the wind was blowing). As noted
above, the children who participated in the post module discussion with the teacher gave varying indications of their
identification (i.e., achieving presence) with the characters and other objects in the VE. With over two-thirds of all
student talk including references to first and second person action, these students demonstrated some level of
achieving identification with their avatar and other characters in the VE, which Slater and Usoh (1993) suggest
indicates achieving presence in the VE.

Conclusion
As noted in the introductory remarks of this paper, prior research literature on presence has been directed toward
adults or older secondary age students, and not middle grade students. Given Piaget’s theory (1953) of child
development, would we find that children in either the Concrete Operations stage (ages 7-12) or Formal Operations
stage (ages 13-adult) would express feeling presence in the SAVE Science modules? Using the narrative analysis
scheme put forth by Slater and Usoh (1993), we analyzed the student talk during the post module discussion with the
teacher to determine whether this was achieved.
First, it is important to note that there were differences among the children sampled in this study. Prior research
indicated males are more likely to use both computer and console games, and this appears to be true for the males in
this sample. However, it is also important that the girls were very active in using computer games, and did use
console games as well. Further, the children completed two different assessment modules.
In reviewing the survey data, students in grades 6 and 7 were able to take the questions seriously and to answer
consistently. In addition, the data analysis showed that for this group of students, prior use of computer games did
correlate positively with reported levels of presence in the SAVE Science modules, but not with prior use of console
games.
We used the qualitative data to lend further insight into this relationship. These results indicate that presence theory
applies to sixth and seventh grade children when using an immersive VE game to assess understanding of scientific
inquiry, but in a cautious way. The quantitative data showed that 55% of the students indicated perceiving being in
the game world. The sixth graders were more inclined to indicate ‘feeling’ the characters in the game were looking
and talking directly to them. The seventh graders were more circumspect and less likely to report the same. In the
discussion with the teachers, these students in both grades clearly stated that they (in first and second person) talked
with the characters in the game, used the tools afforded to them within the game, took notes in the game, graphed
information they collected in the game, and came back to the farmer in both modules with answers to the questions,
not always correct, but answers nonetheless.
Why the difference in the data? One potential variable would be past experience with computer/console games, but
this appears to not be important since students of both teachers had similar experiences with both. One source may
be the survey taken immediately after participating in the game. The second may be the discussion with their teacher
immediately after completing the survey. Students may have felt more comfortable saying things to their teacher,
were showing off to others in the class, or may not have fully understood the questions in the survey.
The differences in responses to the surveys and the discussion may, or may not, be related to the different stage of
Piaget’s development based on age (sixth graders are typically 11-12 years old, while seventh graders are 12-13
years old). The survey responses are more difficult to interpret since there were no significant differences between
grades overall. The responses by the sixth graders in the post-module discussion are a bit more concrete, as in
responding according to direct perceptions and not separating abstract from real. It was one of the sixth grade classes
which could not get past issues about the logistics and game elements, attending more to concrete aspects of playing
the game. The seventh graders appear to be operating more abstractly and being able to separate real from abstract.
Given the fact that we did not assess these students’ stage of development we cannot say this for sure. However,
given their responses to the survey items and the post-module discussion, it seems that the sixth grade students were
more concrete in their reactions to the SAVE Science module, not being able to get past the technical aspects of
61

playing the game. This would mean Piaget’s theory of stages of development, as defined above, fit these students’
responses.
What we can say from this study is that students in sixth and seventh grades are capable of completing an online
survey and having a post-module discussion with their teacher about their experiences within an immersive VE
module. From these two sets of data (surveys and post-module discussion talk), different impressions of the students’
level of perceived presence were found, which may relate to their level of development as defined by Piaget. From
the surveys, the students demonstrated no difference between grades and genders for indicating level of presence in
the game achieved. From the post-module discussion, all students who talked appear to have achieved some level of
presence given the language they used to express their experiences within the game. They were more likely to use
first and second person language to describe their interactions with the characters in the modules than impersonal
third person language. The difference in these findings may be due to impersonal nature of the survey where
responses were not acknowledged versus the personal discussion with their teacher who responded to their
conversation in turn.

Limitations and future research
It is important to point out some limitations to this research. First of all, there was no control group. All students
participated by playing one of the games developed through the SAVE Science project. Hence, there is no way to
demonstrate that this group of students was different or unique as sixth and seventh grade students. Secondly, they
all were from non-urban setting schools. While the demographics of these students is not fully known, the teachers
reported verbally that the majority of their students (e.g., >90%) were Caucasian, native English speakers who were
not identified as Special Education students. These reported demographics indicate the findings are not generalizable
beyond this group of students.
In addition, we did not administer any instrument to determine the exact level of Piaget’s child development for these
students. We are surmising that students who are in sixth grade will more likely be in the Concrete Operations stage,
and those in seventh grade will be moving into the Formal Operations stage, both based on age. However, it is
important to note that without formal assessment, we do not know exactly in which stage of development these
children fall.

Sources of Evidence for Embedded Assessment in Immersive

and assessment can be structured in immersive virtual game environments called Massively
Multi-Player Online Games (MMOG). In doing so, we examine the sources of evidence from
which learning and assessment activities are derived in MMOGs, offering examples of how
multiple evidence channels in operation through game-based activities can be utilized to
construct rich data trails for assessment.

Sources of evidence in MMOGs
A growing body of literature points to the value of a sub-type of virtual worlds-based game called the Massively
Multi-Player Online Game (MMOG) for engagement and learning. Researchers investigating educational
MMOGs have explored the design, functionality, and learning impact of such environments, focusing primarily
on analysis and evaluation of the curricula embedded in them (e.g. Nelson & Ketelhut, 2007; Nelson, 2007). In
this poster, we approach the issue from a different analytical framework, examining the kinds of activities
supported by virtual worlds, with a particular focus on how such activities may provide meaningful data for
assessment.
In spite of the sensory and situational complexity of MMOGs, there are relatively small numbers of
possible recordable interactions supported by the environments from which researchers can gather data relevant
to assessment. These interactions provide data via what we define as Global Evidence Channels. These evidence
channels track learner activities in three main categories: Location/Movement, Object Interaction, and
Communication Activities (Table 1).

Location/Movement
The exploration of virtual worlds by learners offers a rich source of direct and indirect evidentiary data that can
be mined by researchers, educators, and evaluators. By tracking locations visited and the patterns of movements
of learners through a virtual world over time, researchers can assemble a historical trail which provides
information about the moment to moment learning of those students.
In creating MMOG-based assessments, designers can plot out assessment hotspot locations in the
virtual worlds. Each hotspot can contain opportunities for interactions that help indicate the learning state of a
player at that point in space and time. The sequence of location visits within a carefully designed world can also
provide evidence about the state of knowledge construction in a given domain among groups of learners.
Related to the location evidence collection supported by MMOGs is movement-based evidence. Examining the
direction, speed, and duration of travel within a virtual world designed to elicit evidentiary activity can provide
data on student learning over time.

Object Interaction
A second channel of evidence supported by MMOGs is Object Interaction. Object interaction occurs in two
main ways in MMOGs: simple viewing of objects in 3-D space and direct interaction with objects, i.e. selecting,
clicking on, rotating, picking up, moving, or dropping objects in the MMOG world. Within these two categories,
p+!7$)%*"!1.&,(%"1!("5$"#&2&#$#"&(.,".0,".78$%9"45),0%&('6"!(#"48:)8,%$3:+6;"<("==>?%@"8+!7$)%",3.$("&(.$)!1."
with objects without clear purpose. In this mode, they click on all visible objects simply to see what happens
(e.g. signs, buildings, landscape, and NPCs). In contrast, purposeful object interaction is when players seek out,
view, select, and interact with objects in a clear and strategic manner to accomplish some goal. They click on
specific objects in a virtual world that need to be collected to advance the game or that are awarded as
reinforcement for a successful quest completion.
In addition to examining the kinds of interactions a player has with given, data for assessment can be
gleaned by examining the types of objects with which the player interacts in completing an assessment quest.
There are several object types, each of which provides a different type of data to be analyzed: realistic,
enhanced, and media objects. In addition to the different object types, there are a number of in-world object
classes with which players can interact, and through which assessment data of varying kinds can be gathered. In
examining player use of these different object classes, researchers can investigate the manner in which players
interact with the objects, the choice of objects used for specific tasks, the selection and assembly of objects into
a limited inventory of useable tools, and the de-selection or discarding choices of objects.

Communication Activity
A third evidence channel supported by MMOGs is Communication Activity. MMOGs generally support three
classes of communication: text-based instant messaging, voice-based communication, and non-verbal signaling
A!+%,"1!++$#"4$B,.&('6C;"D1),%%"!++"1+!%%$%",3"1,BB:(&1!.&,(@"8+!7$)%"1!("&(.$)!1."0&./",./$) players (and with
NPCs) for social and/or quest-related purposes. Quest-related communication consists primarily of pre-quest
planning strategies for upcoming quests, mid-quest communication used to share information about the quest
and conduct ongoing evaluation of the current status/effectiveness of team members---a kind of formative peerbased evaluation system---, and post-quest summative peer evaluations. In post-quest communication, players
review successful or failed quest strategies and plan changes for future quests to increase the odds of group
success.

Dyadic and Triadic Channel Combinations
When players explore MMOGs, their activities and interactions are virtually never completed in the neatly
delineated fashion we outline above. Rather, players perform actions that produce evidence in dyadic and triadic
combinations from which useful assessment data can be derived.

Conclusion
With careful design, MMOGs can support activities that provide data useful for real-time and post-hoc
assessment of individual and group learning over time. These data have no inherent value for assessment by
themselves. It is only through careful design of the virtual worlds, in-world objects, tasks, and quests that the
data take on meaning for assessment. As we progress in our own research, we are working to refine the initial
ideas presented here, and seek to answer the many questions raised by this discussion.

Abstract In this paper, we present the results of an exploratory study into the relationship
between student self-efficacy and guidance use in a Multi-User Virtual Environment
(MUVE) science curriculum project. We describe findings from a sample of middle school
science students on the combined impact on learning of student self-efficacy in scientific
inquiry and use of individualized guidance messages, and on the interplay between levels of
self-efficacy and use of an embedded guidance system in an educational MUVE. Results
from our study showed that embedded guidance was associated with improved learning
outcomes for learners across a spectrum of self-reported efficacy in science. However, we
also found that learners with low levels of initial self-efficacy in science viewed fewer
guidance messages than their higher efficacy peers, and did not perform as well as their
higher efficacy peers regardless of guidance use level. At the same time, outcomes for low
self-efficacy students who used the guidance system heavily were raised to the level of high
self-efficacy students who did not use the system.

The once fantastical idea of embedding curricula into the game-like cyber worlds of multiuser virtual environments (MUVEs) is beginning to gain wider support in the educational
research community. Increasing numbers of studies are investigating the use of these
immersive computer-based environments as platforms for authentic inquiry in science

(e.g. Barab et al. 2005a; Nelson 2007; Nelson et al. 2007; Clarke and Dede 2005), and as
environments supportive of situated learning principles and embedded activities that
approximate authentic science (e.g. Gee 2003; Steinkuehler 2004; Steinkuehler and Chmiel
2006; Shaffer 2006; Galarneau and Zibit 2007).
Research in educational MUVEs is part of a broader focus on the use of gaming
environments for learning (Gee 2003). For example, in 2006 the Federation of American
Scientists released a major report in which they urged increased research into and financial
support for investigating the use of complex gaming environments as platforms for
learning. In the same year, the MacArthur foundation launched a five-year, $50 million
“Digital Media and Learning” initiative to understand how digital technologies are shaping
and changing the lives of young people. A principal component of the initiative supports
the development and study of collaborative gaming environments including MUVEs.
Since 2002, we have been investigating the viability and learning impact of one such
MUVE called River City. We are focusing on a variety of theory-based questions about use
of the environment and associated curriculum to support instruction in middle school
science inquiry. Our design definition for scientific inquiry stems from the National Science
Education Standards:
Inquiry is a multifaceted activity that involves making observations; posing questions;
examining books and other sources of information to see what is already known;
planning investigations; reviewing what is already known in light of experimental
evidence; using tools to gather, analyze, and interpret data; proposing answers,
explanations, and predictions; and communicating the results (National Research
Council 1996, p 23).
In the current study, we examine the possible interaction between student-perceived selfefficacy as practitioners of science and the use of an embedded guidance system which
provides meta-cognitive questions. These questions are designed to support learners in
reflecting on their inquiry and data gathering processes in a MUVE-based scientific inquiry
curriculum. We are interested in the impact of self-efficacy since the literature in this area
indicates that it mediates behavior (see for example, Pajares 2000) and our own research
demonstrates that scientific inquiry behaviors are impacted by a student’s perceived selfefficacy (Ketelhut 2007). Research in psychology and education also tells us that we might
expect the level of a student’s self-efficacy in scientific inquiry to impact the use of learning
strategies, such as our guidance system (Pintrich and DeGroot 1990). From this we
hypothesize that increased levels of self-efficacy are associated with increased levels of
guidance viewings.
To further complicate this relationship, both levels of self-efficacy and of guidance are
known to positively influence performance on tasks and outcome measures (Bong 2002;
Pajares 1997, 2000; Zimmerman and Bandura 1994). Thus, we hypothesize that guidance
views mitigate the impact of low self-efficacy on learning outcomes. Finding ways to
diminish the far-reaching effects of low self-efficacy is crucial for science education.
Currently, too few students engage with science beyond middle school. Nearly one-third of
all students take only a single year of high school science, all but closing the door for future
studies in science (Grigg et al. 2006). For many, this choice starts as early as early
adolescence and is due to low self-efficacy in science (Leslie et al. 1998).
To investigate whether a MUVE-based guidance system could alleviate some of the
differences due to self-efficacy, we conducted an exploratory analysis into the combined
impact of guidance use and self-efficacy in scientific inquiry on learning in an educational

Computer-Supported Collaborative Learning

MUVE designed to teach scientific inquiry skills. In our analysis, we focus on the
following questions:

&

&

How does self-efficacy in scientific inquiry impact use of the guidance system? Do
students with lower self-efficacy in scientific inquiry view fewer guidance messages
within the presentation of a MUVE-based science curriculum than students with higher
self-efficacy in scientific inquiry?
How does the guidance system mitigate the impact of low self-efficacy in scientific
inquiry on learning, if at all? Do students with low self-efficacy in scientific inquiry
approach the performance on content tests of students who report high self-efficacy in
scientific inquiry as levels of guidance messages increase?

Theoretical underpinnings
Self-efficacy
Self-efficacy refers to a person’s belief in his/her ability to perform specific tasks or
processes and to achieve designated results (Pajares 1996). As it relates to scientific inquiry,
self-efficacy can be defined as a student’s perceived capability to perform the tasks
involved in scientific inquiry (Ketelhut 2007). It is not a measure of how well students
believe they will succeed or how interested they are in the tasks of inquiry; rather, it is a
measure of their confidence to conduct the activities at the heart of scientific inquiry.
Researchers have investigated the topic of self-efficacy from various perspectives,
describing both the origin of a person’s self-efficacy and its effect on behavior. In his
seminal work on self-efficacy, Bandura (1977) asserts that a person’s belief in his or her
own abilities has a powerful impact on whether or not that person initiates “instrumental”
actions, and on the extent and length of effort that a person will expend in pursuing those
actions. Similarly, Pajares (1996, 2000) contends that self-efficacy affects behavior by
regulating the extent of a person’s expended effort, their ability to persevere in difficult
situations, and their engagement with the task. In those situations, Pajares states that
increasing levels of self-efficacy are associated with increasing effort, perseverance, and
engagement.
A number of studies have found that high levels of perceived self-efficacy predict
performance. In a large meta-analysis of 114 studies into the link between self-efficacy and
task performance, Stajkovic and Luthans (1998) found that high levels of self-efficacy were
positively correlated with performance of tasks examined in the studies. Lent et al. (1984,
1986) and Lent and Hackett (1987) found that a person’s level of self-efficacy impacts both
the choice of careers that person chooses to pursue and the level of academic achievement
in tasks related to those careers.
Of particular interest to the topic of this study is whether there is any indication of a
relationship between level of student self-efficacy and the initial take up and continued use
of guidance. The literature in this area is diverse and falls into two main arenas: use of selfregulated learning strategies and help-seeking behavior. Bandura (1986) asserts that selfefficacy positively guides students’ choice of self-regulated learning strategies. A good
review of the research supporting this tenet can be found in Pajares (2002). The relationship
between self-efficacy and help-seeking behavior is equivocal with studies showing widely
divergent results regarding whether high or low self-efficacy students are more likely to

416

B.C. Nelson, D.J. Ketelhut

show help-seeking behaviors and whether this behavior is beneficial for learning or not
(for a review see Pajares et al. 2004).
Use of a guidance system embedded in an educational MUVE relies on students’
willingness to make use of this novel meta-cognitive strategy, but once they do, the
guidance system developed for the current study offers reflective hints rather than directive
help. As such, it would appear likely that use of the embedded guidance in a MUVE would
more likely reflect the research on self-regulated learning and thus indicate that students
with high self-efficacy would be more likely to access the guidance messages than students
with low self-efficacy in scientific inquiry. However, since use of the guidance system in
the River City MUVE is not directly taught as a learning strategy, it is possible that its
appearance in a technology-supported learning environment may mimic the help function
often found in traditional educational software packages. If so, then the inconclusive
literature on help-seeking behaviors and self-efficacy would be more on point. This study
aims to shed light on this dichotomy.
MUVE research
Researchers investigating educational MUVEs as learning environments have explored the
design, functionality, and potential impact of such environments on student learning and
motivation (e.g. Bers 1999; Bers and Cassell 1998; Corbit and DeVarco 2000; Slator et al.
2004). For example, the research team behind the Quest Atlantis MUVE has published a
number of studies about the environment describing its benefits on student engagement and
learning (e.g. Barab et al. 2005a,b). Quest Atlantis is a MUVE-based curriculum in which
elementary and middle school students can take part in a large number of quests to help the
people of Atlantis avoid environmental, moral, and social decay (Barab et al. 2005a, b). In
one Quest Atlantis study, Barab et al. (2007) describe a multi-level investigation of the
learning benefits associated with a curriculum designed to support scientific inquiry
practices situated in realistic, socially relevant issues. Students in the study completed a
two-week curriculum designed to support their development of environmental awareness
and real-world science inquiry skills while investigating an interactive narrative in the
Quest Atlantis environment. Results of the study show promising findings related to student
engagement in the MUVE-based curriculum, sophisticated explanations of curricular
processes and outcomes, and statistically significant improvement on classroom and
standardized assessments.
While research into the Quest Atlantis MUVE has shown promise, engagement among
students has been uneven. Lim et al. (2006) studied the levels of engagement exhibited by
students participating in virtual scientific inquiry activities in Quest Atlantis. Among the
eight participants (11–12 year olds) at a primary school in Singapore, the authors found a
low level of engagement as measured by a seven-level “engagement taxonomy.” Through
interviews with the students and observations of the implementation, the researchers
suggested that the biggest contributors to the low engagement were the open-endedness and
interactivity of the MUVE, which appeared to distract students from the processes and tasks
associated with inquiry.
In her studies of the MOOSE Crossing multi-player environment, Bruckman found
similar issues with engagement on the part of children who used the environment to create
and share virtual artifacts to learning computer programming (Bruckman 1996, 2000). In
one study, Bruckman (2000) performed a portfolio-style assessment of 50 children using
MOOSE Crossing to study programming. She found that 40% of the sample group failed to
engage in the main curricular task of writing a programming script. Bruckman contended

Computer-Supported Collaborative Learning

417

that unevenness in participation and student learning is an inherent by-product of openended MUVE-based learning based on a socio-constructivist theoretical framework.
Socio-constructivism and MUVEs
The curricula used with educational MUVEs generally find students learning through openended exploration of the software environment with limited embedded guidance support.
This kind of unguided collaborative exploration fits well with what Perkins (1991) called
“Without Information Given” (WIG) constructivist theory. In this view, students build up a
personal understanding of a given topic through self-directed interactions with the content
and processes associated with the topic. The curriculum embedded in an early iteration
of the River City MUVE reflected this kind of highly unstructured exploratory learning
(Dede et al. 2002).
Most recent MUVE-based research focuses on questions of student engagement, sociocultural interactions, and learning. This research centers on curricula featuring cooperative,
open-ended inquiry activities within MUVEs (Barab et al. 2007; Nelson et al. 2005, 2007),
and based on a socio-constructivist approach to learning that values free exploration and
knowledge building.
There is little agreement among researchers that unguided exploration is the best route to
learning. For example, Kirschner et al. (2006) argue that constructivist learning environments with minimal guidance cannot work because they ignore the cognitive processing
research into the structure of human memory systems. According to Mayer (2004), in a
series of empirical studies dating back to the 1950s, unguided learning has repeatedly been
shown to be inferior to guided learning. On the other hand, Flum and Kaplan (2006)
describe exploration as a fundamental human trait with developmental, learning, identity
formation, and even career benefits. Consequently, they believe the learning should have an
“exploratory orientation.” However, they acknowledge that the experience of unguided
exploration requires tolerance on the part of the individual for ambiguity and uncertainty.
As an alternative to wholly unguided exploration, some researchers suggest that openended learning environments such as MUVEs should provide students with tools to build
and test hypotheses as scaffolds to the exploration process (Jonassen 1991; Lebow 1993).
This type of guidance is called “self-directed,” or reflective, guidance (Jonassen et al. 1999).
Reflective guidance in constructivist environments differs from direct instruction in that it
does not provide overt answers or make judgments about particular student actions.
Reflective guidance messages instead focus on assisting with student meta-cognition,
asking students to reflect upon their learning, describe how they will proceed, and use
graphics and/or text to map out their growing understanding (Baylor 2000; Jonassen
et al. 1993).
This view of reflective guidance echoes those applied to cognitive “scaffolding,” which
Puntambekar and Hubscher (2005) define as a system of prompts and hints that support
learning. These guidance tools serve to externalize the invisible cognitive processes taking
place within each student (Hannafin et al. 1997; Jonassen 1991), and scaffold students’
thinking as they develop their own understanding of content present in a given learning
environment.
Guidance in MUVEs
In our previous work, one of us has investigated whether the use of embedded reflective
guidance in educational MUVEs might offer additional learning benefits over unguided

418

B.C. Nelson, D.J. Ketelhut

exploration in the virtual worlds. We built a reflective guidance system into the River City
educational MUVE, and tested whether use of the guidance led to more effective learning
for students. In a study with 272 middle school students completing a MUVE-based science
inquiry curriculum, it was found that, while simple exposure to an individualized guidance
system in the MUVE had no measurable impact on learning, increased viewing of guidance
messages was associated with significantly higher (p<0.05) scores from pre- to post-tests
on scientific inquiry skills and disease transmission knowledge gained through a MUVEbased curriculum (Nelson 2007).
Although guidance use appeared to help students perform well in the MUVE, there was
a great deal of variability in levels of guidance use, and a relatively large (25%) percentage
of the students with access to the guidance who never used it. In an effort to account for
some of this variation, a number of student demographic variables (gender, SES, prior
grades in science, age) and affective measures (prior computer use, experience with
gaming, etc.) were examined, but only one was identified as having a statistically
significant interaction with guidance use and learning: gender. Although boys and girls both
benefited from guidance use, boys viewed significantly fewer hints than girls, and showed
lower average gains in content measures across all levels of guidance use.

The River City MUVE project
Our current study is centered on River City, an educational MUVE designed to teach
scientific inquiry skills to middle school students. The River City curriculum focuses on
skills of hypothesis formation and experimental design, as well as on content related to
national standards and assessments in biology and ecology. The main learning goal for
students exploring River City is to discover why residents of the virtual town are getting
sick (Nelson et al. 2005).
The River City virtual world is set in the late 1800s, and named for the river that runs
through most of the town. River City includes explorable digital institutions and
buildings such as homes, shops, a library, elementary school, hospital, university, and city
hall (see Fig. 1).
Upon entering the city, the students’ avatars can interact with computer-based agents
(residents of the city), digital objects (pictures and video clips), and the avatars of other
students. In exploring, students also encounter visual stimuli such as muddy dirt streets, and
auditory stimuli such as the sounds of coughing town residents, which provide tacit clues as
to possible causes of illness. Content in an embedded Web browser shifts based on what the
student encounters or activates in the virtual environment, such as a dialogue with an agent
or historic photos and accompanying text that provide additional information about the
town and its residents (see Fig. 2).
Students work in small teams to develop and test hypotheses about why town residents
are ill. Water-, air-, and insect-borne diseases are integrated within a curricular framework
incorporating historical, social, and geographical content, allowing students to develop and
practice the scientific inquiry skills involved in disentangling multi-causal problems
embedded within a complex environment (Clarke et al. 2006; Ketelhut et al. 2005). Over
the course of the curriculum, students experience a year of virtual time in River City. On
each visit, student teams continue to explore River City, working to form a hypothesis.
River City supports hypothesis testing for students by allowing them to change a single
factor in one of two identical worlds in order to view the impact, if any, that change had on
a particular disease. After student teams design their own hypothesis about the cause of the

Computer-Supported Collaborative Learning

419

illnesses, they test it by choosing an independent variable to alter. For example, students
may decide that cramped living quarters in the public house in River City is a source of
illness, and decide to build new housing to lower population density in the “projects.”
Students then compare the “control” and “experimental” worlds to see if their actions have
had any effect on various factors, such as residents’ illnesses, water pollution, or number of
mosquitoes.

Design and procedure
Research questions
The research questions on which our current analysis is centered are:
1. How does self-efficacy in scientific inquiry impact use of the guidance system? Do
students with lower self-efficacy in scientific inquiry view fewer guidance messages
within the presentation of a MUVE-based science curriculum than students with higher
self-efficacy in scientific inquiry?
2. How does the guidance system mitigate the impact of low self-efficacy in scientific
inquiry on learning, if at all? Do students with low self-efficacy in scientific inquiry
approach the performance on content tests of students who report high self-efficacy in
scientific inquiry as levels of guidance messages increase?

Sample
This paper presents the results of a Fall 2004 implementation in a Mid-Atlantic state with a
total sample of 300 middle school students. In the current study, we focus on a subpopulation of 96 students (50 boys and 46 girls) who were provided access to an embedded
guidance system used in conjunction with the MUVE. This student sample was somewhat
homogenous: 6% were eligible for free or reduced lunch and 11% spoke English as a
second language. These students were randomly assigned, in teams of three, to the guidance
treatment within their seventh-grade science classes, and took part in the River City
curriculum with their peers who were randomly assigned to other versions of the curriculum
not covered in this study.
Procedures
Students in the treatment group at the center of this study were provided access to an
individualized guidance system (IGS) featuring continuously updated guidance links and
associated messages. Students worked through the River City curriculum in teams of three,
sharing information both in the MUVE and via face-to-face strategy sessions in the
classroom. Although students worked in teams, each individual explored River City on his/
her own computer. Consequently, each student in the guidance treatment had access to the
guidance system on an individual basis.
The guidance in this study was designed as a system of reflective guidance prompts. The
system utilized data collected on each student’s individual activities to offer reflective
questions about the students’ data gathering in the MUVE, with the content of the questions
based on in-world interactions, such as clicking on pictures, reading signs and charts, and
asking questions of computer-based “town residents.” To create the guidance system, all
objects with which students could interact were tagged with identification codes. When a
student clicked on an object or “spoke” to a River City citizen, a record of the event was

Computer-Supported Collaborative Learning

421

stored in a database. A guidance model was triggered after each student interaction in the
MUVE. A subset of these interactions was associated with guidance scripts. These scripts
then prompted the appearance of “hint buttons” that, when clicked, displayed reflective
questions to students.
Students with access to this guidance system could view three hints per pre-defined
information hot-spot object in River City. Whenever students clicked on a specially tagged
object inside the virtual world, the guidance system would flash alternating colors to
indicate that new hints were available. The IGS did not automatically show specific
guidance messages but instead displayed hint buttons linked to messages (see Fig. 3). To
view guidance messages, students needed to click on these hint buttons. In this way, we
were able to track if and when students chose to access the guidance messages and which
messages they saw.
Students spent approximately the next 12 days participating in the project as part of their
science classes. The first four of these days were spent in the computer lab exploring and
gathering information from four sequential versions, worlds, of River City itself. During
visits 1 and 2, students were encouraged to explore River City; to interact with the
computerized residents, the library books, the admissions record and the Smithsonian
artifacts. During visits 3 and 4, students continued to explore and were also given access to
the water and bug sampling stations. These four days were followed by two days of face-toface experimental design group work in the regular classroom. Students then returned to the
computer lab and re-entered River City to gather information to test their hypothesis, first
from the control world and then from the experimental world, which differed by one factor
that each team of students chose in advance. Student teams then spent two days in the
classroom analyzing their data. After this, students were asked to write a report to the
Mayor of the town in which they discussed their hypothesis, experimental design, results
and recommendations for solving the city’s health problem. Finally, a mini-research
conference was held in each classroom to allow student teams to report on their findings.
Measures
Both qualitative and quantitative data were collected from students over the implementation
period. Pre- and post-intervention, the students completed an affective measure that
consisted of various subscales from three different surveys, Self-Efficacy in Technology
and Science (SETS; Ketelhut 2005), Patterns for Adaptive Learning Survey (Midgley et al.
2000), and the Test of Science Related Attitudes (Fraser 1981). Of particular interest to this
study was the subscale used from the SETS: self-efficacy in scientific inquiry. This subscale
contains 12 items (see Appendix) with each rated on a scale from 1 (low) to 5 (high).
Overall scores are computed by averaging the student’s responses across the 12 items of the
subscale, with high scores representing high self-efficacy. The measure has an estimated
internal consistency reliability of 0.86 in a population of middle school students.

To assess understanding and content knowledge (science inquiry skills, science process
skills, biology), we administered a 30-question content test, pre- and post-intervention with
an internal consistency reliability of 0.80 in a middle school population. These tests were
designed to evaluate whether and to what extent participating students had increased their
knowledge of the desired outcomes of the curriculum, that is, an understanding of and
ability to apply scientific inquiry skills to investigate a real-world problem, and an
understanding of various methods of disease transmission.

Findings
The quantitative data were analyzed with SAS, using a significance level of p≤0.05; checks
for linearity, normality and homoscedasticity were performed at intervals with no violations
found. Our first research question asks whether students with low self-efficacy in scientific
inquiry made less use of the embedded guidance system than those with higher selfefficacy. The answer is yes. In this study, we found that students with low self-efficacy in
scientific inquiry viewed significantly fewer guidance messages (p<0.05) than their peers
with higher initial self-efficacy. In addition, it was found that boys viewed significantly
fewer messages than girls (p<0.05), overall. This gender difference was still evident when
initial self-efficacy level was taken into account. In other words, boys across a range of
initial science self-efficacy scores viewed fewer guidance messages than girls at the same
level (p<0.05). This relationship can be seen in Fig. 4.
To assess research question 2, we first regressed student posttest scores on levels of use
of the individualized guidance system and pretest scores. In this analysis, we found that
viewing guidance messages had a significant positive impact on posttest scores (p<0.01).
In other words, holding pretest scores constant, students who viewed more guidance
messages outperformed students who viewed fewer.
To investigate whether the guidance system could mitigate the effect of low self-efficacy
students on learning, we added initial level of self-efficacy in scientific inquiry to the

scientific inquiry, by
gender (n=94)

Computer-Supported Collaborative Learning

423

model. Since one of us (Ketelhut 2007) has shown that self-efficacy and pre-test science
content scores have overlapping effects in educational MUVE implementations, pre-test
scores were not included in this model. Here we found that students with lower initial selfefficacy scores did not perform as well as their higher efficacy peers at each level of
guidance message viewing. In other words, students with lower initial self-efficacy scores
performed less well than higher self-efficacy students across a spectrum of guidance
message viewing. Although use of the guidance system helped low self-efficacy students
perform better, guidance use was not able to bridge the self-efficacy gap in learning
outcomes. Figure 5 shows this relationship. However, it is important to note that guidance
viewing did mitigate the impact of low self-efficacy on learning to a small degree. Students
with low self-efficacy who viewed a large number of guidance messages did as well as
students with high self-efficacy who viewed no messages. Thus, while it cannot level the
playing field evenly, the guidance system did improve outcomes.

Discussion and conclusion
From our prior research we learned that use of embedded guidance in the River City
MUVE could help improve student science content scores. However, we also found that
viewing levels of guidance messages varied widely among students with access to them. In
this study, we sought to account for some of that variability by examining the role that
student self-efficacy in scientific inquiry might play on guidance use. Confirming what the
literature says regarding behavioral choices and self-efficacy, we can see from the results
that initial self-efficacy on entry into the River City MUVE affects overall how students
make use of the embedded guidance system, with low self-efficacy students viewing fewer
guidance messages on average than their higher self-efficacy peers. Since it has been shown
that use of the guidance system in River City can improve academic outcomes (Nelson

2007), the lower levels of guidance use among students with low self-efficacy may be
handicapping their learning in the environment. River City has been designed since its
inception with a goal of providing a motivating, engaging environment for under-achieving
students. Unless a way to boost guidance use by low self-efficacy students can be found,
implementations of a curriculum with a strong pedagogical bent toward helping these
students close the learning gap with their higher-achieving classmates will not reach its
mark.
However, what is not clear from this analysis is whether the relationship between
seeking guidance and self-efficacy is constant throughout the project or varies over time
and with exposure. Is it possible that continued exposure to guidance hints helps change
behavior so that there is little difference in behavior between low and high self-efficacy
students? If so, could that mean that given time all students might begin to take advantage
of the learning process?
There is research that would indicate that this is the case. Schunk (1983, 1987) has found
that self-efficacy appears to rise when students are provided with just-in-time feedback,
help, and signals that success was due to their own hard work. These are all features that
can be found in an embedded guidance system. In addition, one of us conducted an in-depth
investigation with this same student population examined in the current study and
curriculum implementation to investigate the influence of student self-efficacy in scientific
inquiry on data-gathering behavior in the MUVE over time (Ketelhut 2007). In that study,
student self-efficacy predicted for behavior initially, but by the fourth visit to the River City
virtual town, the effect of self-efficacy on interactions with the environment had
disappeared. In other words, students with low self-efficacy prior to the start of the study
behaved no differently than students with high self-efficacy by their fourth visit to the
environment.
Our other major finding is that guidance viewing can only mitigate the impact of low
self-efficacy on learning in a very moderate way. However, this is an important finding
for the community of researchers on help-seeking. Recall that the literature on whether
help-seeking behaviors improve learning is equivocal. Yet, in our study, we discovered
that not only did guidance views improve outcomes, it did so for students at all levels of
self-efficacy.
Of interest is our un-hypothesized finding regarding gender—that girls across all levels
of self-efficacy accessed more guidance messages than boys. In its report on educating girls
in the computer age, The American Association of University Women (AAUW)
educational foundation lists a number of design suggestions for computer games that will
hold appeal for girls, including rich narrative, customizable avatars, opportunities for
collaboration and communication, and opportunities for positive social action (American
Association of University Women 2000).
Because MUVEs support many of the features suggested by the AAUW report as useful
for “girl-friendly” software, it is perhaps not surprising that our findings indicated relatively
higher levels of guidance use among girls. Past MUVE studies, including our own
described earlier (Nelson 2007), have indicated that MUVEs are supportive of high levels
of participation, motivation, and learning outcomes among girls. One such study on gender
and programming achievement in a text-based MUVE found that girls spent significantly
more time than boys communicating with others in the environment (Bruckman et al.
2002). Barab and his colleagues conducted an extensive analysis of gender participation in
the Quest Atlantis (QA) MUVE (Socially-Responsive Design Group 2004) and found no
differences in terms of overall participation rates in the MUVE between boys and girls.
However, looking specifically at participation as reflected by online communication, it

Computer-Supported Collaborative Learning

425

was found that girls used chat more than boys (p<0.01) and sent more e-mail messages
(p<0.01) than boys. In addition, Barab’s group found that girls wrote more in their online
notebooks when completing quests and engaged in longer metacognitive reflections about
their work in the MUVE. This finding, although not a focus of the current study, is one
worth pursuing in future MUVE research.
Our overall findings indicate that future research should investigate methods through
which use of guidance embedded in educational MUVEs can be better facilitated for low
self-efficacy students. We suggest that future studies draw from literature on guidance- and
help-seeking strategies to find ways to better support guidance uptake and continued use by
low self-efficacy students. Another tack we suggest for future research is to investigate
methods that can be used by MUVE curriculum designers to help improve the self-efficacy
of learners as a result of their interactions in these kinds of learning environments. Raising
self-efficacy of all learners is vital, as the effects of self-efficacy are far ranging. For
example, students with low self-efficacy in a given area are less likely to choose a career in
that domain (Lopez and Lent 1992). With well-designed educational MUVE-based
curricula incorporating individualized guidance and engaging inquiry, we hope that all
learners can better understand and apply principles of real-world science inquiry.

I can write an introduction to a lab report.
I can use graphs to show what I found out in my experiment.
It is hard for me to write a report about an experiment.
I know how to use the scientific method to solve problems.
It is hard for me to look at the results of an experiment and tell what they mean.
When I do an experiment, it is hard for me to figure out how the data I collected answers
the question.
When I do my work in science class, I am able to find the important ideas.
Once I have a question, it is hard for me to design an experiment to test it.
I can design an experiment to test my ideas.
I have trouble figuring out the main ideas of what my science teacher is teaching us.
I can tell the difference between observations and conclusions in a story.
It is easy for me to make a graph of my data.
