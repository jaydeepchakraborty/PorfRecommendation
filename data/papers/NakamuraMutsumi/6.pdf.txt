Abstract. We propose an inexpensive and scalable approach for curation that takes advantage of automatic information extraction methods as a starting point, and is based on the premise that if there are a lot of articles, then there must be a lot of readers and authors of these articles. Thus we provide a mechanism by which the readers of the articles can participate and collaborate in the curation of information.

1 Introduction
Besides the data that exists in various public and private databases, there is a much larger and ever increasing amount of information buried in existing biomedical articles. It is beyond human ability to read the various relevant articles and recall relevant findings of these articles for further research. Therefore, it becomes clear that the findings in these articles have to be culled and stored in a database such that the data can be integrated with other existing databases. The sheer volume of the articles and their constant growth makes it prohibitively expensive to employ (and monetarily compensate) human curators to read through the articles and cull the necessary knowledge/data buried in them. Nevertheless, such human curation (see for example [1,37,21]) has been tried for specific domains. Due to the issue of cost, many of the curated databases are proprietary with limited coverage. In recent years an alternative approach of using automatic text extraction systems [2,8-20] has been proposed. Although good progress has been made in this area, the systems are not fool-proof. They at times infer incorrect information or miss out important information. Moreover, most existing systems focus on simpler data forms, such as identifying gene or protein names, simple interactions without context. Sometimes such simplicity may lead to inconsistency. In this paper we propose a solution to the problem of curating information from the large and growing body of biomedical texts and abstracts. We propose a methodology where the community collaboratively contributes to the curation process. We use automatic information extraction methods as a starting point, and promote mass col-

laboration with the premise that if there are a lot of articles, then there must be a lot of readers and authors of these articles.

2 CBioC System Architecture
The two main components of our CBioC system are (i) the CBioC interface and (ii) the CBioC database. The user interacts with the CBioC system through the CBioC interface. When a user views a PubMed article, the CBioC interface is automatically invoked to display all the extracted interaction data relevant to the article. The user curates the extracted interaction data through voting. Depending on the access level, an user can also enter or modify data. The CBioC interface has many subcomponents such as the automatic invocation component, the user and access management component, and the voting and other interactions component. Two auxiliary components of the system are (a) a suite of automated text extraction systems and (b) a data exchange system. The text extraction systems are used to automatically extract data from texts and abstracts and the data exchange system is used to download relevant data from existing databases (such as [7,9-13] ) and convert them to our format. This is illustrated in Figure 1 below.

Fig. 1. Functional architecture of the CBioC System We now illustrate the use of the CBioC system which also further illuminates on the architecture of the CBioC system. Installation and Invocation: An important goal of ours is to make it easier for a researcher to participate in the collaborative curation. For that a researcher has to

download our system and install it in her computer. Once the system is installed it watches the researcher's access of the web through Internet Explorer windows. Whenever the researcher accesses a web page from where she can access an article or an abstract, the CBioC system is invoked and an interaction frame is created, as shown below in Figure 2.

System Implementation: From the implementation angle, the CBioC system consists of three main parts: (i) Web forms and connection to database; (ii) WebBand and Browser Helper components, and (iii) Connector to Interaction Extractor, and is currently implemented for Internet Explorer in the client side and Linux-MySQL-Php on the server side. This is illustrated in Figure 3 below.
