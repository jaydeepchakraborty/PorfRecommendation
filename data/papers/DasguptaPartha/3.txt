The need for training employees in new skills in an organization generally arises due to the changing skill requirements coming from the introduction of new products, technology and customers. Efficient assignment of employees to trainings so that the overall training cost is minimized while considering the career goals of employees is a challenging problem and to the best of our knowledge there is no existing work in literature that solves this problem. This paper presents TRaining AssigNment Service (TRANS) that minimizes an organizationâ€™s overall training costs while assigning employees to trainings that match their learning ability and career goals. TRANS uses an ORGanization and Skills ontology (ORGS) to calculate the cost for training each available employee for a potential role taking into account constructivist learning theory. TRANS uses TRaining assIgnMent algorithm (TRIM), based on Hungarian method for bipartite matching, for assigning employees to trainings. In our experiments with real-world data, proposed allocation algorithm performs better than the existing strategy of the organization.
