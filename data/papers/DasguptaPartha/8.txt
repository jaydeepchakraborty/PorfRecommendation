Digital microfluidic biochip (DMFB), a latest invention in lab-on-a-chip devices integrates electronics with biology for development of customized miniature devices intended for new application areas namely clinical diagnostics and detection, DNA analysis, point-of-care applications and so on. All-Terrain droplet actuation (ATDA) based biochips have (has) recently been emerged as the new variant in DMFB devices for application in 3D domain. In this work, we explored the possibility of design optimization followed by development of design automation techniques specifically applicable in 3D biochips. We consider the advantages and issues involved in development and application of 3D based design. Accordingly we demonstrated few prescheduled bioassay execution in both 2D and 3D domain and the following enhancement in the route performance.
