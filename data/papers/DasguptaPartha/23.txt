We present formal methods for determining whether a set of components with given reliability certificates for specific functional properties are adequate to guarantee desired end-to-end properties with specified reliability requirements. We introduce a formal notion for the reliability gap in component-based designs and demonstrate the proposed approach for analyzing this gap using a case study developed around an Elevator Control System.
