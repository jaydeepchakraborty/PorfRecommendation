The paradigm of Service-oriented computing (SOC) introduces emerging concepts for distributed- and e-business processing enabling the sharing and reuse of service-centric capabilities. The underpinning for an organization's use of SOC techniques is the ability to discover and compose Web services. Leading industry approaches rely heavily on syntactical approaches for managing service-based business processes. As such, these approaches are limited since the true functionality of ambiguous capabilities (i.e. web service operations) cannot be inferred. We introduce approaches that disambiguate services by interleaving process-based control with semantic annotations. In this paper, we introduce a generalized architecture where intelligent software agents control process-oriented composition that leverages the descriptiveness of semantics. An outcome of this work is the specification of a multiple agent system where a query agent interacts with multiple repository agents to perform business-oriented service composition.
