The Software Enterprise is a pedagogical model combining traditional lecture with project-based learning. The Enterprise model leads students through a modular series of lessons that combine foundational concepts with skills-based competencies. In this tutorial, software engineering educators in higher education or industry will learn the methodology, get exposed to assessment techniques such as e-portfolios and concept maps, and become familiarized with the open resources available to educators that adopt the pedagogy. This tutorial should be of interest to any educator interested in making their project-based courses more engaging and more relevant to students needing to be ready to practice the profession from the first day they exit the Enterprise environment.
