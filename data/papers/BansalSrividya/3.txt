An information technology (IT) tool that can guide STEM educators through the complex task of course design development, ensure tight alignment between various components of an instructional module, and provide relevant information about research-based pedagogical and assessment strategies will be of great value. A Semantic Web-based software tool called Instructional Module Development (IMOD) System, currently under development, is built upon a framework for outcome-based course design. It uses Semantic Web technologies to provide intelligent interactions with the users, dictate a course design process in conformance with the underlying framework, checks for omissions and inconsistencies in the design, provides feedback to the user on their course design, and recommends relevant assessment and pedagogical approaches along with help on how they are implemented. In this paper, we present an ontology called IMOD-Ont that aims at describing and formalizing entities in the domain of instructional design and is used by the IMOD system. IMOD-Ont ontology complements existing metadata schemas and linked data approaches in the field of technology-enhanced learning that focus on describing learning resources and educational content that is available on the Web. The goal is to make the semantic data generated from course designs created through the IMODS tool available as linked education data on the web.
