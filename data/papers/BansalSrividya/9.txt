Learning management systems and student information systems have been in use for years in a number of universities across America. However, their use is not as widespread in universities in India. The main reasons have been the lack of high-speed Internet availability, reluctance from universities to try new software, and the high cost of commercial products (which are not differently priced for the Indian market). In recent years, Internet penetration has significantly improved and a number of universities even have direct connections to the internet backbone. Social media use has become very widespread, and students and teachers are familiar and comfortable with a number of web-based applications. The goal of this project is to develop a prototype for a low-cost web-based application that provides features of both learning management systems and student information systems, and is customized to the needs of universities in India.
