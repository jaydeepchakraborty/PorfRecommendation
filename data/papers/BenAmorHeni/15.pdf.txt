Abstract— This paper proposes a probabilistic framework
based on movement primitives for robots that work in collaboration with a human coworker. Since the human coworker
can execute a variety of unforeseen tasks a requirement of our
system is that the robot assistant must be able to adapt and
learn new skills on-demand, without the need of an expert
programmer. Thus, this paper leverages on the framework
of imitation learning and its application to human-robot interaction using the concept of Interaction Primitives (IPs).
We introduce the use of Probabilistic Movement Primitives
(ProMPs) to devise an interaction method that both recognizes
the action of a human and generates the appropriate movement
primitive of the robot assistant. We evaluate our method
on experiments using a lightweight arm interacting with a
human partner and also using motion capture trajectories of
two humans assembling a box. The advantages of ProMPs in
relation to the original formulation for interaction are exposed
and compared.

movement must also be coordinated relative to the location at which the
human worker executes the task.

I. I NTRODUCTION

to learn the interaction and to adapt to a variety of unforeseen
tasks without the need of an expert programmer.
Motivated by the described scenario, this work proposes
the use of imitation learning [1] in the context of collaboration. Imitation learning has been widely used as a method to
overcome the expensive programming of autonomous robots.
Only recently, however, its application for physical interaction has been introduced under the concept of Interaction
Primitives (IP) by Lee at al. in [2], defined as skills that
allow robots to engage in collaborative activities with a
human partner by Ben Amor et al. in [3].
Leveraging on the framework of [3], our approach is based
on probabilistically modeling the interaction using a distribution of observed trajectories. We propose using Probabilistic
Movement Primitives (ProMPs) [4] for modeling such a
distribution. In a manufacturing scenario such a distribution
of trajectories can be obtained by observing how two coworkers assemble a product, several times throughout the
day, providing a rich data set for imitation learning. Such a
collection of trajectories is used to create a prior model of the
interaction in a lower dimensional weight space. The model
is then used to recognize the intention of the observed agent
and to generate the movement primitive of the unobserved
agent given the same observations. The movement primitive
of the unobserved agent can then be used to control a robot
assistant.
The main contribution of this paper is the introduction
of the Probabilistic Movement Primitives [4] in the context
of imitation learning for human-robot interaction and action

While the traditional use of robots is to replace humans in dangerous and repetitive tasks we motivate this
paper by semi-autonomous robots that assist humans. Semiautonomous robots have the ability to physically interact
with the human in order to achieve a task in a collaborative
manner. The assembly of products in factories, the aiding of
the elderly at home, the control of actuated prosthetics, and
the shared control in tele-operated repetitive processes are
just a few examples of application.
Only recently, physical human-robot interaction became
possible due advances in robot design and safe, compliant control. As a consequence, algorithms for collaborative
robots are still in the early stages of development. Assistance
poses a variety of challenges related to the human presence.
For example, Fig. 1 illustrates a robot assistant that helps a
human to assemble a box. The robot must not only predict
what is the most probable action to be executed based on
the observations of the worker (to hand over a screw driver
or to hold the box) but also the robot movement must be
coordinated with the worker movement. Pre-programming a
robot for all possible tasks that a worker may eventually need
assistance with is unfeasible. A robot assistant must be able

recognition. We will show how Interaction ProMPs can
be applied to address the three main problems previously
illustrated in Fig. 1, that is: (a) learning a collaborative model
by imitation learning and thus avoiding expert programming,
(b) the ability to recognize a task by observing the worker,
and (c) the coordination of the assistant movement in relation
to the worker movement. We also show the advantages of
ProMPs over the original DMP-based framework [3], and
present an algorithm for aligning data using local optimization in order to avoid the issue of slope constraints typical
of dynamic time warping.

in classifying interactions. However, this often requires a
substantial set of training data. In particular for humanoid
motion generation with many degrees-of-freedom, it is often
challenging to acquire sufficiently large and general data sets.
For more efficient learning and generalization, various
authors investigated the projection of the original trajectories into a new, low-dimensional space where correlations
between the agents are easier to unravel. Llorens et al. [11]
show how such a low-dimensional interaction space can
be used to implement an assistive robot arm. Similarly in
[7], probabilistic principal component analysis is used to
find a shared latent space. Dynamic Movement Primitives
(DMPs) [12] allows for a low-dimensional, adaptive representation of a trajectory. The general idea is to encode a
recorded trajectory as dynamical systems, which can be used
to generate different variations of the original movement. In
the context of interaction, Prada et al. [13] present a modified
version of DMPs, that adapts the trajectory of one agent to a
time-varying goal. By setting the goal to the wrist of another
agent, the method can be used to generate handover motions.
Although graphical models and HMMs have been successfully used for action and intention recognition in a
discretized symbolic level, the generation of trajectories
for the continuous dynamic control of the robot is usually
addressed by a different level of representation (e.g. a lowerlevel HMM [6] or DMPs). In relation to the previously
cited works, here, we propose a framework based solely
on a continuous movement representation that is used to
both recognize actions and generate trajectories in the form
of movement primitives; mainly leveraging on DMP-based
Interaction Primitives [3] and Probabilistic Movement Primitives (ProMPs) [4]. By using ProMPs rather than DMPs our
prosed method naturally correlates different agents directly
in the same space in which observations are made, since
observations of a task are usually given by their trajectories.
This is an advantage in relation to the original framework
of [3] since the representation of collaboration in the space
of accelerations/forces due to the use of DMPs obfuscates
the algorithm and increases its sensitivity to noise in the
observations.

II. R ELATED W ORK
The data-driven analysis and classification of interactions
between multiple persons has long been addressed within the
computer vision community. In particular visual surveillance
tasks, e.g., tracking of multiple pedestrians, require methods
for identifying the occurrence and type of person-to-person
interactions. In a seminal paper, Oliver et al. [5] show
that hidden Markov models (HMMs), and more generally
graphical models, are suited for representing the mutual
dependencies of the behaviors between interacting agents.
Graphical models have gained popularity in the field of
human-robot interaction as they naturally include temporal
information into the inference process and the Bayesian
semantics provides a simple way to encode prior knowledge.
In [6], Lee et al. use a hierarchical HMM to learn and
represent responsive robot behaviors. In their approach, a
high-level HMM identifies the current state of the interaction and triggers low-level HMMs which correspond to
the robot’s motor primitives. In order to ensure that the
robot adapts to the movement of the human partner, virtual
springs are attached between markers on the human body and
corresponding positions on the robot. In a similar vein, Ben
Amor et al. [7] use a path-map HMM to model interactions
in cooperative tasks. In their approach, a backbone of shared
hidden states correlates the actions of the interacting agents.
Tanaka et al. [8] use a Markov model to predict the
positions of a worker in an assembly line. The space in
which the worker moves is discretized into different regions.
A Gaussian mixture model relates positions to procedures.
Using this information a robot, then, delivers tools and
parts to a human worker along the assembly line. Besides
HMMs, other probabilistic graphical models have also been
used to address interaction tasks. Koppula et al. [9] use a
conditional random field with sub-activities, human poses,
object affordances and object locations over time. Inference
on the graphical model, allows a robot to anticipate human
activity and choose a corresponding, preprogrammed robot
response. Wang et al. [10] propose the intention-driven
dynamics model, which models human intentions as latent
states in graphical model. Intentions can be modeled as
discrete variables, e.g., action labels, or continuous variables,
e.g., an object’s final position. The transitions between latent
states and the mapping from latent states to observations
are modeled via Gaussian Processes. As evidenced by
these works, graphical models can be very powerful tools

III. P ROPOSED M ETHOD
This section briefly introduces Probabilistic Movement
Primitives for a single degree of freedom as presented in [4]
and proposes its extension for interaction and collaboration.
Although not covered in this work, in its original proposition,
the design of a feedback controller that tracks the distribution
of trajectories is also part of ProMPs and the interested
reader is referred to [4] for details; here we assume the
existence of a human-safe standard feedback controller such
as a low-gain PD controller. This section also exposes the
main characteristics of the interaction framework based on
DMPs in [3] and its relation to the approach of this paper.
Finally, a simple local optimization algorithm is proposed
for aligning several demonstrations provided by a human.

where w̄d is the augmented weight vector corresponding
to the d-th demonstration, wp is the n-dimensional column
vector of weights of the p-th DOF of the observed agent, and
wq is the vector of weights of the q-th DOF of the controlled
agent. The mean and covariance are then computed by
stacking all demonstration weights

A. ProMPs for a Single DOF
For the purposes of the following derivations we generically refer to each joint or Cartesian coordinates of a human
or robot simply as a degree of freedom (DOF) with position
q and velocity q̇. Starting with the case of a single DOF, we
denote y(t) = [q(t) q̇(t)]T and a trajectory as a sequence
τ = {y(t)}t=0,...T . We adopt linear regression with n
Gaussian basis functions ψ. The state vector y(t) can then
be represented by a n-dimensional column vector of weights
w as

µw = mean([w̄1 , ..., w̄d , , ..., w̄D ]T ),
Σw = Cov([w̄1 , ..., w̄d , , ..., w̄D ]T ),

where D is the number of demonstrations.
Gaussian conditioning can then be applied on-line as each
new observation is made using recursive updates in the form
−

µ+
w = µw + K(y (t) − Ht µw )

where Ψt = [ψ(t), ψ̇(t)]T is a 2×n dimensional timedependent basis matrix and y ∼N (0, Σy ) is zero-mean i.i.d.

trajectory is then

where K is the Kalman gain matrix, y ∗ (t) is the observed

observation matrix Ht is block diagonal and each diagonal
entry contains the 2×n basis [ψ(t), ψ̇(t)]T for each observed
joint

Similar to DMPs the speed of the execution of the movement is decoupled from the speed of the original trajectory
by using a phase variable z(t). The phase variable replaces
the time in order to control the location of the basis functions
with ψ(z(t)). For simplicity we will use z(t) = t such that
ψ(t) = ψ(z(t)) while remembering that any monotonically
increasing function can be used [4].
Each trajectory is now represented by a low-dimensional
vector w since the number of basis is usually much smaller
than the number of time steps. Trajectory variations obtained
by different demonstrations are captured by defining the
distribution over the weights p(w|θ), where θ is the learning
parameter. The probability of the trajectory becomes

p(τ |θ) = p(τ |w)p(w|θ)dw.

In the collaboration case only measurements of the observed agent are provided. By maintaining consistency with
definition (4) where the entries of the observed agent
come before the controlled agent, the mean is then µw =

where each zero entry is of 2×n dimension. Note that if only
positions of the observed agent are provided (Ψot )(p,p) =
[ψ(t), 0(t)]T .
In general, since (6) is a full state linear estimator, any
partial combination of observations (for example when y ∗
only contains positions, or velocities, or a mixture of both)
provides the optimal estimate of states µ+
w and their uncertainty Σ+
.

B. ProMPs for Collaboration
The key aspect for the realization of the interaction primitives is the introduction of a parameter θ that captures the
correlation of all DOFs of multiple agents. Assuming that
the distribution of trajectories of different agents is normal,
then p(w; θ) = N (w|µw , Σw ). Under this assumption we
redefine the vector of weights w to account for all degrees of
freedom of multiple-agents. Following the definitions in [3]
we will refer to the assisted human as the observed agent,
and assume that he/she provides the observed DOFs of the
model (e.g by motion capture). The robot will be referred to
as the controlled agent.
For an observed agent with P DOFs and a controlled
agent with Q DOFs, we construct a row weight vector by
concatenating the trajectory weights

C. Action Recognition for Primitive Activation
Here we use the ProMP framework in a multi-task scenario
where each task is one encoded by one interaction primitive.
Consider a specific task s ∈ {1, .., K} and assume that
for each task an Interaction ProMP has been generated as it
was proposed in section III-B. Using the recursive notation
of (6), the upper script (·)− refers to the parameters of the
Interaction ProMP updated up to the previous observation,

that is θs− = {µ−
w , Σw }s . The probability of the observation

the tasks is
Z
p(y ∗ (t); θs− ) =
p(y ∗ (t)|Ψt w, Σ∗y )p(w|θs− )dw (9)

E. Time Warping with Local Optimization
One issue of imitation learning for trajectories is that
multiple demonstrations provided by humans are usually,
sometimes severely, warped in time. Demonstrations must
be unwarped or time-aligned before the distribution of the
weights can be computed. Here we propose aligning trajectories by taking one of the demonstrations as a reference yr
and using local optimization of the time warping function
with

The task s can now be recognized by applying Bayes rule

,
p(s|y ∗ (t)) = PK

∗
k=1 p(y (t)|θk )p(k)

(11)

where tjw represents a vector containing the warped time of
demonstration yw at the j-th iteration of the optimization.
We propose g as a smooth, linear Gaussian-basis-model
with P weights v j = [v1j , ..., vPj ] as the parameters to be
optimized. The extra parameter v0j is used to shift the time
which is useful when the reference and warped trajectories
are, in fact, identical but start at different instants. The
optimization is initialized with v0j = 0 and tjw = tr for
j = 1. The parameters v j are optimized with gradient descent
to decrease the absolute cumulative distance between the
reference and warped trajectories

where p(s) is the initial probability of the task (e.g. p(s) =
1/K for uniform distribution). We will evaluate Eqs. (9)-(11)
using real collaboration data in the experimental section of
this paper.
D. Relation to Interaction DMPs
It is now straightforward to relate our proposed method
with the previous interaction primitives based on DMPs
[3]. The principal difference is that in the framework of
interaction DMPs the weights are mapped from the forcing
function f (t) as opposed to the positions q(t). Using the
linear basis-function model
f (t) = ψ(t)T w,

v = arg min

where g is the goal attractor, αy , βy are user-defined parameters that characterize the spring-damper behavior and τ
controls the speed of execution. For details on DMPs please
refer to [12] and references therein.
When using imitation learning a demonstration is executed
and measurements are usually given in the form of positions,
which must be differentiated twice such that the forcing
function can be computed
f (t) = q̈/τ 2 − αy (βy (g − q) − q̇/τ ).

|yr (tr (k)) − yw (v0j + g(v j )tjw )|.

While Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) [14] is widely
used for such problems, our local method forces alignment
without “jumping” the indexes of the warped time vector
which is an usual outcome of DTW and renders unrealistic
and non-smooth trajectories. While this problem is usually
minimized by imposing a slope constraint [14], the use
of a smooth function g not only avoids the tunning of
this parameter but also preserves the overall shape of the
trajectory.

where ψ(t) are the normalized Gaussian basis functions.
Similarly to the ProMP case a distribution of weights p(w)
is learned based on several demonstrations of a task.
For each DOF, the forcing function adds a nonlinear
behavior on the movement which complements a linear and
stable spring-damper system
q̈ = [αy (βy (g − q) − q̇/τ ) + f (t)]τ 2 ,

This section presents results on a simple simulated scenario to compare the differences between the original work
of Interaction DMPs with Interaction ProMPs. Next, we
evaluate the accuracy of Interaction ProMPs for generating
reference trajectories for an anthropomorphic robot arm
conditioned on the movement of a human. Finally, we will
show experimental results with Interaction ProMPs used in
a collaborative scenario of a box assembly to both recognize
and predict the action of two collaborators.

A. Comparison with Interaction DMPs

Referring back to (6) the Gaussian conditioning is now
based on the observation of forces or accelerations, that
is y ∗ (t) = f (q̈, (·), t)∗ . As our evaluations will show,
the fact that forces are usually computed using second
derivatives of the position can be restrictive for applications
with asynchronous or sparse measurements as the observed
accelerations needed for conditioning are hard to obtain in
this case. In contrast, in the ProMP framework, it is possible
to directly condition on the observed quantities, i.e., the
position of the agent.

In a typical interaction task the observations of a coworker
might arrive asynchronously, at irregular periods of time, for
example, when the measurement signal is prone to interruption (a typical case is occlusion in motion capture systems).
Fig. 2 (a) illustrates a simple case where both observed and
controlled agents have a single joint each. The training data
was created by sketching two sets of trajectories on a PC
screen using a computer mouse. We than use these two sets
as proxies of the observed and controlled agents resulting
on the initial distribution of trajectories (in blue). The upper

Fig. 3 compares the prediction error over the whole trajectory of Interaction DMPs and ProMPs given the same noisy
observed data. With DMPs the error is greatly influenced by
the amount of noise while ProMPs show much less sensitivity. For the case where the full trajectory of collaborator
A is observed (indicated by the arrow) the prediction error
increased by a factor of five times using the Interaction
DMPs when noise ranged from a clean signal to a signal
of noise variance 0.04. In contrast, the error deteriorates by
a factor of two with Interaction ProMPs.

DMPs suffer from noisy position measurements as the observation must be differentiated twice to compute the forcing
function. While low-pass filters alleviate this problem, the
introduction of phase lag is an issue that can be potentially

a robot based on observations of a human partner. The
experiment consisted in measuring the [x, y, z] trajectory

capture1 while pointing at a certain position on a table
placed in front of our robot (a 7-DOF anthropomorphic
arm with a 5-finger hand). Then, the robot was moved in
gravity compensation mode to point with its index finger
at the same position on the table while its joint positions
were being recorded (kinesthetic teaching). This pair of

frame located at the torso of the robot (as shown in Fig. 4(b)).

trajectories formed by the Cartesian positions of the wrist
and the joint positions of the arm where then mapped into
the weight space and concatenated as in Eq. (4). In total,
nine different positions were pointed to collect training data,
sparsely covering an approximate circular area of diameter
30 cm. The pointed positions are shown in Fig. 4(a) by the
dots.
After creating the Interaction ProMPs, as described in
Section III-B, we defined extra nine marked positions shown
in Fig. 4(a) by the crosses. The human then pointed at one
of the crosses while motion capture was used to measure the
trajectory of the wrist. These observations were then used
to condition the Interaction ProMP to predict trajectories for
each joint of the robot, whose mean values where used as
reference for a standard trajectory tracking inverse dynamics
feedback controller with low gains.
Fig. 4(b) shows one example of the interactive task where
the human pointed to the position marked by the cross #1,
which was not part of the training; the robot was capable of
pointing to the same position. Note that the robot was not
provided with any exteroceptive feedback, such as cameras,
to reveal the location of the pointed position. Although
the robot was not directly “aware” of the position of the
pointed cross, the interaction primitive provides the robot the
capability to predict what movement to make based solely
on the observed trajectories of the partner.
Figure 5 shows two examples on the conditioned interaction primitives when the human pointed at positions #6 in (a)
and #8 in (b) (refer back to Fig. 4(a) for the physical position
of the crosses). The first row in each subplot shows the
[x, y, z] coordinates of the wrist. The second row shows the
first four joints of the robot, starting from the shoulder joint.
Since we are only interested in the final pointing position, the
interaction primitive was conditioned on the final measurements of the wrist position. As positions #6 and #8 were
physically distant from each other, the difference between
their predicted trajectories were quite large in relation to
each other, roughly covering the whole span of the prior

distribution (in blue) for some certain DOFs of the arm.
Figure 6 shows the distance error on the plane of the
table between the position pointed by the robot and its true
position. The robot was able to reasonably point even at
locations at the limits of the training data such as position
#1, #7, and #8 (see Fig. 4). The maximum error was of
3 cm, or 10% in relation to the total area covered by the
training points (approximately a circle of diameter 30 cm).
The experiments show that the physical movement of the
robot is clearly conditioned by the position indicated by the
human (see the accompanying video2 ).
Note that this not a precision positioning experiment; the
markers on the wrist were not fixed in a rigid, repeatable
manner, neither the finger of the robot could be positioned
with milimetric precision during the kinesthetic teaching
phase. The framework of Interaction ProMPs allows, however, to seamlessly integrate additional sensing to increase
accuracy in precision tasks. This is naturally achieved adjusting the observation vector y ∗ in (6) and the zero entries in
(8) to include new sensory information such as the reference
position of a hole in which the robot must insert a peg.

how Interaction ProMPs can be used for recognizing the
action of the observed agent and to select the appropriate
desired movement primitive of the controlled agent. This
capability allows the robot to maintain a library of several
tasks encoded as Interaction ProMPs and to activate the
appropriate primitive based on the observation of the current
task.
As shown in the photos of Fig. 7, we collected collaborative data in the form of the Cartesian coordinate positions
of the wrists of two humans assembling a box. As in the
previous experiment of section IV-B, all measurements were
taken in relation to the torso of the robot. The collaborator
on the right plays the role of the observed agent while the
collaborator at the left plays the role of the controlled agent.
The controlled agent will be referred to as the predicted agent
since he/she can not be controlled.
In the ”hand-over” task shown in Fig. 7(a), the observed
agent stretches his hand as a gesture to request a screw.
The predicted agent then grasps a screw sitting on the table
and hand it over to the collaborator. In the ”fastening” task
shown in Fig. 7(b), the observed agent grasps an electrical
screwdriver. The predicted agent reacts by holding the box
firmly while the observed agent fastens the screw. In the
”plate insertion” task shown in Fig. 7(c), the observed agent
grasps the bottom plate of the box. The predicted agent then
flips the box such that the slots to which the plate slides in
are directed towards the observed agent.
Each task is repeated 40 times. All trajectories are aligned
using the method described in Section III-E. The aligned
trajectories are shown in Fig. 7 under their respective photos
as three-dimensional plots for each of the tasks where the
covariance in x-y directions are shown at the corresponding

We evaluated action recognition using Eqs. (9)-(11) on
the three presented tasks for box assembly. Fig. 8 shows
one evaluation as an example. Note from the figure that the
majority of observations indicate that the fastening task is
taking place. The last five observations (surrounded by the
ellipse), however, fits both tasks and could be a potential
source of ambiguity in task recognition. Even in those

by the plots in Fig. 9 where the probabilities of the task
are given as a function of the number of observations.
Subplots (a), (b) and (c) show the task recognition for the
fastening, hand over and plant insertion tasks, respectively.
In general, we observed that 3-5 observations are required to
achieve a 100% certainty for each task. (The last part of the
accompanying video shows our method controlling the robot
assistant to assembly a box with recognition of two different
handover tasks).
V. C ONCLUSION
This paper introduced a method for collaboration suited
for new applications using semi-autonomous robots whose
movements must be coordinated with the movements of a
human partner. By leveraging on the original framework of
Interaction Primitives [3] we proposed the use of ProMPs
for the realization of primitives that capture the correlation
between trajectories of multiple agents. This work compared the main differences between DMPs and ProMPs for
interaction and advocates the later for applications where
measurements are noisy and/or prone to interruption. Using
a 7-DOF lightweight arm we evaluated the capability of
Interaction ProMPs in generating the appropriate primitive
for controlling the robot in an interactive task involving
a human partner. We also proposed a method for task
recognition that naturally fits the ProMP framework.
Our current work addresses the use of mixture-models to
