Abstract
Genetic skeletal disorders (GSD) involving the skeletal system arises through disturbances
in the complex processes of skeletal development, growth and homeostasis and remain a
diagnostic challenge because of their clinical heterogeneity and genetic variety. Over the
past decades, tremendous effort platforms have been made to explore the complex heterogeneity, and massive new genes and mutations have been identified in different GSD,
but the information supplied by literature is still limited and it is hard to meet the further
needs of scientists and clinicians. In this study, combined with Nosology and Classification
of genetic skeletal disorders, we developed the first comprehensive and annotated genetic
skeletal disorders database, named ‘SkeletonGenetics’, which contains information about
all GSD-related knowledge including 8225 mutations in 357 genes, with detailed information associated with 481 clinical diseases (2260 clinical phenotype) classified in 42 groups
defined by molecular, biochemical and/or radiographic criteria from 1698 publications.
Further annotations were performed to each entry including Gene Ontology, pathways
analysis, protein–protein interaction, mutation annotations, disease–disease clustering
and gene–disease networking. Furthermore, using concise search methods, intuitive
graphical displays, convenient browsing functions and constantly updatable features,
‘SkeletonGenetics’ could serve as a central and integrative database for unveiling the genetic and pathways pre-dispositions of GSD.

Introduction

mutation information and extensive annotations for GSD.
Initially, we retrospectively extracted the basic information
for each mutation (disease conditions or syndrome, gene
symbol, number of OMIM, hereditary mode, coding sequence change, transcript, ethnicity, age, PubMed ID, etc.)
from open publications. Additionally, extensive annotations were performed, which include gene information,
Gene Ontology, pathways analysis, protein-protein interaction, mutations clustering and gene-disease network. As
a result, 42 groups of GSD, 481 diseases or syndromes,
357 genes, 5884 single nucleotide variations (SNVs), 516
insertions, 1427 deletions and 2260 different phenotypes
were included. Taken together, ‘SkeletonGenetics’ is constructed to be a well-organized, internal-standard and
comprehensive resource for scientists and clinicians looking for the clinical correlates of mutations, genes and pathways involved in skeletal biology.

Methods
The standard of data entry group of GSD
The Nosology Group of the International Skeletal
Dysplasia Society formulated the table of NCGSD-2015 in
September, 2015. The criteria used for genetic skeletal disorders were unchanged from NCGSD-2010 revision. They
were (1) significant skeletal involvement, including skeletal
dysplasias, skeletal dysostoses, metabolic bone disorders
and skeletal malformation and/or reduction; (2) publication and/or listing in OMIM; (3) genetic basis proven by
pedigree or very likely based on homogeneity of phenotype
in unrelated families; (4) nosologic autonomy confirmed
by molecular or linkage analysis and/or by the presence of
distinctive diagnostic features and of observation in multiple individuals or families (4). In accordance with the
standards of NCGSD-2015, 481 different conditions were
placed in 42 groups, associated with one or more of 357
different genes. The grouping results and criteria are presented in Supplementary Table S1.

Data collection and content
Based on the standards of NCGSD-2015, we performed
comprehensive searches for GSD-related publications and
databases to obtain a complete list of mutation information associated with GSD. Firstly, we retrospectively
queried the PubMed database (http://www.ncbi.nih.gov/
pubmed) for genes and diseases retrieved in Entrez with
terms ‘gene or disease symbol [Title/Abstract] AND mutation [Title/Abstract] OR variant [Title/Abstract]. Secondly,
other databases were taken as supplementary sources,
including Leiden Open Variation Database 3.0 (LOVD3.0,

The skeleton provides the structural framework in humans
for muscle attachments, assists movement, protects organs,
and maintains the homeostasis of the vascular systems (1).
Perturbation of development in bone, cartilage and joints
could result in human skeletal dysplasias, which affect approximately 1 in 5000 live births and is one of the common
causes of neonatal birth defect in departments of obstetrics
(2). Genetic skeletal disorders (GSD), which are a group of
disorders involving gene mutations or genetic susceptibility
to bone disease, account for most of the human skeletal
dysplasias, involving a variety of pathogenic factors and
diseases (3). In the Nosology and Classification of Genetic
Skeletal Disorders 2015 revision (hereinafter referred to as
NCGSD-2015), 436 conditions were included and placed
in 42 groups, which were associated with mutations in one
or more of 336 unique genes (4). Till now, especially with
the impact the next-generation sequencing technology has
made on the study of genetic skeletal disorders, a large
amount of mutations and novel GSD-related genes have
been identified. Genetic skeletal disorders face similar problems to other complex diseases with exceptional genetic
heterogeneity and clinical variety (5). Notably, the same
skeletal dysplasia gene can lead to substantially different
clinical phenotypes or a specific skeletal phenotype can be
caused by mutations in different genes (6). Therefore,
understanding genotype–phenotype correlations and functional diversity remains one of the major challenges for
GSD.
The NCGSD-2015 provides an overview of the recognized diagnostic entities of GSD by clinical, anatomical site
and molecular pathogenesis for clinicians, scientists and the
radiology community to diagnose individual cases and
describe novel disorders (5). However, the increasing availability of next-generation sequencing technology and other
new sequencing platforms will likely result in a rapid identification of novel GSD-related genes and mutations, and
novel phenotypes associated with mutations in genes linked
to other phenotypes has increased dramatically to date (7,
8). Therefore, the catalog of GSD-related genotype-phenotype has become so large as to surpass the scope of a
‘Nosology’, so the Nosology must be transformed into an
automated annotation and query database. Thus, it is crucial
to integrate the existing data and present an organized comprehensive mutation repository to construct an integrative,
informative and updatable resource for GSD-related genetic
pre-dispositions which could greatly facilitate the counseling, diagnosis and therapy for pediatrics and genetics.
In this study, we reviewed three dependent databases
and public resources related to genetic skeletal disorders
and made the first annotated database about GSD, named
‘SkeletonGenetics’, which provides full-scale gene and

syndrome, Cornelia de Lange syndrome, which all belong
to the Top 5 of the disease list, all have >367 gene mutation information. At the same time, we classified the number of mutations by group: the limb hypoplasia-reduction
defects group; the overgrowth syndromes with skeletal involvement group; the lysosomal storage diseases with skeletal involvement (dysostosis multiplex group); the
disorganized development of skeletal components group;
and the dysostoses with predominant craniofacial involvement group all have >375 mutation information. Finally,
according to the information collected, we statistically analyzed the bias by chromosomes, mutation types, mutation
effect, gender, ages of onset and inheritance mode.

Information statistics
Specific skeletal phenotype can be caused by mutations in
different genes or the same gene can lead to substantially
different clinical phenotypes. This leads to the bias of genotype and phenotype of GSD, therefore statistics on the
number of mutations for gene, disease and the group become very important. The gene Top 5 with the highest
number of mutations in ‘SkeletonGenetics’ is ‘FBN1’, associated with four skeletal diseases (Marfan syndrome,
Weill-Marchesani syndrome 2, Geleophysic dysplasia type
2, Acromicric dysplasia) with 639 mutations; followed by
‘NF1’ associated with Neurofibromatosis type 1 with 415
mutations; ‘NIPBL’ associated with Cornelia de Lange syndrome 1 with 406 mutations; ‘NSD1’ associated with
Sotos syndrome 1 with 362 mutations; ‘GNPTAB’ associated with two diseases (Mucolipidosis II, alpha/beta type;
Mucolipidosis III (Pseudo-Hurler polydystrophy), alpha/
beta type) with 231 mutations. Correspondingly, Marfan
syndrom, Fanconi anemia, Neurofibromatosis, Sotos

Functional and enrichment analysis
To further interpret the function and heterogeneity of
GSD, ‘SkeletonGenetics’ performs a series of functional
analyses, which included enrichment analysis, mutation
annotation, mutation spectrum and gene-disease network
construction (Figure 1).
For the aspect of enrichment analysis, we provided
Gene Ontology (GO), KEGG pathways, Wikipathways,
MicroRNA Target and Protein–Protein interaction.
Meanwhile, we used WebGestalt software to store the
gene list in ‘SkeletonGenetics’ (12, 13). Users can click on
the ‘Analysis’ page to see whether the gene of interest is
involved in any GO terms, function pathways, microRNA
target or PPIs.
Gene ontology annotation terms involved the biological
process, the cellular component and molecular function of
three biological processes, the Top5 most statistically

excluded (9), Clinvar (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clin

(OMIM) (11) were used to describe phenotypic information. Patient clinical data have been obtained in accordance
with the tenets of the Declaration of Helsinki.
Finally, >2000 publications were queried from open resource beginning in 1990. After manually screening the abstracts and full-text of these publications, we excluded
those studying diseases other than GSD and eventually retained 1698 publications. We extracted the basic information for each mutation, including disease name, gene
symbol, inheritance mode, CDS change, PubMed ID, ethnicity, age, gender and functional study through reading
the full-text articles and double-checked these manually.
The in-house perl program was used to obtain the correct
genomic coordinate for each entry. As of the beginning of
2016, the ‘SkeletonGenetics’ database contains 481 disease
conditions, associated with mutations in one or more of
357 different genes, 8225 variations (5884 SNVs, 1427 deletions, 516 insertions and 398 Block substitution), 2260
clinical phenotypes and their detailed information included
in 42 groups of GSD from 1698 publications ranging from
common, recurrent mutations to ‘private’ mutations found
in single families or individuals. The results are presented
in Table 1.

‘SkeletonGenetics’, namely, skeletal system development
(P-value: 3.29E-63, number of genes, 87) (14); appendage

(15); limb development (P-value: 6.25E-46, number of

5.11E-45, number of genes, 48) (15); and limb morphogenesis (P-value: 5.11E-45, number of genes, 48) (16). The
above entries of the most statistically significant GOs terms
are all related to skeletal system or component formation,
morphological differentiation and location control.
Meanwhile, we provided functions pathways, including
KEGG pathways and Wikipathways of two annotation
methods. A complex series of signaling pathways including
TGF-beta signaling pathway (P-value: 1.07E-13, number
of genes, 14) (17); Hedgehog signaling pathway (P-value:
5.85E-09, number of genes, 9) (18); WNT signaling pathway and pluripotency (P-value: 1.72E-06, number of

(P-value: 1.48E-14, number of genes, 41) are essential for
proper skeletogenesis (21), mainly distributed in the cell,
extracellular matrix, and transcriptional regulation related
to bone, cartilage, and joint formation. Researchers recommend use of a morphogen rheostat model to conceptualize
the differential signaling inputs which lead to divergent
skeletal phenotypes within a temporal and spatial context

(1). In these terms, we have established some function
pathways of the relationship between different gene mutations and groups of bone diseases.

fate transitions during differentiation. These processes are
important to ensure proper organogenesis and growth of

cluster heterozygous mutations cause Feingold syndrome,
a disorder that involves limb malformations, microcephaly,

deeper understanding of the pathophysiology and complex
genetics of GSD.

metalloproteinase group (MMP2, MMP9 and MMP13)
(24) and the Fibrillin-TGFbeta receptor group (causing
overgrowth syndromes, including FBN1, FBN2, TGFb1
and TGFb2) (25).
The above functional and enrichment analysis results,
including classical genetic and epigenetic modifications, is
consistent with previous findings that skeletal system development, appendage development, limb development,
appendage morphogenesis and limb morphogenesis are
related to genetic skeletal disorders.

Mutation annotation

Mutation spectrum and gene–disease network
The location of the gene mutation is biased, some of which
are located in the 50 -UTR region, 30 -UTR region or the
mutation-rich region, and some are distributed in single
mutation sites, such as 1138G > A mutation in FGFR3 of
achondroplasia (30) and 49G > A mutation in AKT1 of
proteus syndrome (31), which accounted for 98% and
100% of the total number of mutations, respectively.

Therefore, in order to facilitate the search for mutation information and statistics on the bias of the mutation position, we used scalable vector graphics (SVG) to visualize
the mutation distribution in each GSD-gene for related syndromes, each simulated fonts including gene position information, gene name (number of exons, transcript ID), and
encoded information, with different colors to represent different mutation effects or types, which presented a gene
level overview of the summarized mutations. For example,
the syndrome of achondrogenesis type 2 (ACG2; LangerSaldino), can be expressed as chr12:48 367 189-48 398 104,
Gene: COL2A1 (54 coding exons, NM_001844 or
NM_033150) and mutations in exonic or intronic, the variations were more than once distinguished by different colors
and fonts from those first identified. Besides, SVG was used
to construct a graphical gene-disease network to provide the
potential relations of GSD and skeletal-related genes for
understanding the complex heterogeneity of GSD.
Information about the gene–disease network includes the
number of GSD genes, mutation information and different
disease phenotypes. For example, the COL2A1 related to
nine common genetic skeletal disorders, including achondrogenesis type 2 (ACG2; Langer-Saldino), platyspondylic
dysplasia, Torrance type, hypochondrogenesis, spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia congenital (SEDC), spondyloepimetaphyseal dysplasia (SEMD) strudwick type, kniest dysplasia,
spondyloperipheral dysplasia, mild SED with premature
onset arthrosis, SED with metatarsal shortening (formerly
Czech dysplasia), stickler syndrome type 1, are depicted by
a simple ball (red ball represents gene and blue ball represents disease) and a straight line to construct the gene–disease network. Users click on the corresponding graphics and
can quickly link to detailed information on mutations and
phenotypes.

Data search and browse
‘SkeletonGenetics’ provides a quick and concise search box
on the home page for searching by five symbols. Firstly,
there are three gene symbol search modules, ‘gene symbol’,
‘gene ID’ and ‘gene transcript’; secondly, mutation position
and phenotype information were incorporated to allows
users to search by (i) specifying options like gene name
(capital letters), gene ID, transcript information (ii) investigating the specified phenotype of the typical skeletal
changes related to the position of the forearm of the upper
limb, to the description of the variability to the extent of
skeletal changes (iii) search mutation position data of more
than one gene or mutation, or when it is known that a mutation or gene is located on a particular area or chromosome, a position symbol list will be needed to achieve this
fuzzy search. To facilitate users browsing the data, two

‘SkeletonGenetics’ performed the detailed annotation information of all mutations to facilitate the users to assess
the regarding interest mutations. Firstly, the coordinates of
variations, such as SNV, (FBN1, NM_000138 and
c.5198G > A) or InDels, (COL2A1, NM_033150 and
c.4234_4245del) were converted to the corresponding
coordinates on the human reference genome GRC37/hg19
(chr15:48755305-48755305) and (chr12:48367202-4836
7213) by UCSC Genome Browser (26) and the in-house
perl program was used to convert coordinates from CDS to
genome. Secondly, the general annotation of mutations,
such as the effects on protein coding (frameshift, nonframeshift, non-synonymous, splicing, stopgain, stoploss,
etc.), amino acid change and the location of the mutation
(exonic, intronic, intergenic, region, etc.) were performed
by ANNOVAR (27). Additionally, more detailed clinical
information was provided about each entry, including
PubMed ID, ethnicity, gender (male or female), age-ofonset (death, newborn, days, weeks, months, years) and
hereditary mode. Another 27 databases or data sets were
linked and annotated, such as seven quick links (NCBI,
HGNC, MGI, OMIM, Ensembl, Vega and GeneCards),
15 functional prediction software, dbSNP (28) and 1000
Genomes Project (29), ESP, CG69, ExAC. Phenotype
information extracted from the HPO databases and provided the OMIM ID, MGI ID, phenotype or syndrome
name (such as Weill–Marchesani syndrome 2, dominant),
phenotype description (related to search module phenotype
button), cosmic70, clinvar_20150330 information, etc.

different approaches are provided: (i) browse by disorders
(ii) browse by chromosome (Figure 2). The ‘browse by disorders’ option provides 42 groups and 481 conditions of
genetic skeletal disorders for users to conveniently retrieve
the information about mutations of interest. The genes and
mutations related to this group or disease conditions can
be easily retrieved by selecting from the list. Additionally,
users can browse all the variants that are mapped on the
entry chromosome or chromosomal bands in a graphical
way in ‘browse by chromosome’, which is linked to the

MicroRNA Target and Protein–Protein interaction were
stored in separate tables. All data can be freely downloaded

phenotypes. Automatic mining methods will be used in
‘SkeletonGenetics’ for updating GSD-related data, (1) collect the latest disorders, genes or mutation from PubMed
or open databases related to GSD; (2) perform more extensive functional and enrichment analysis based on the
updated data sets; (3) improve the mutation spectrum,
gene–disease network and other database functionalities.
In SkeletonGenetics, researchers may use the ‘Submission’
page to upload de novo mutations for GSD or new genetic
skeletal disorders to keep the database up-to-date and
comprehensive. We believe that ‘SkeletonGenetics’ will
hopefully have paved the way by setting standards for the
recognition and definition of skeletal phenotypes and
understanding of the complex heterogeneity of GSD and
hope that the continued efforts to improve
‘SkeletonGenetics’ will ultimately help improve diagnosis
and treatment of genetic skeletal disorders.

phenotypic features defined by common radiographic features or anatomical site. Meanwhile, researchers criticize
the previous versions, focusing on their ‘hybrid’ nature,
which does not stick to a single systematic approach.
Firstly, disorders should be classified on phenotypic similarities. Secondly, they should be reclassified based on the
pathway or gene related to the functional abnormality (4).
Based on the above principles, and as more and more resources are published on the network resource, we developed a comprehensive database for genes and mutations
related to genetic skeletal disorders, ‘SkeletonGenetics’
integrated data types associated with GSD through indepth mining of 1698 publications and extensive functional analysis, which covered a broad range of data
including lists of disease grouping and disease names,
genes, mutations and mutations spectrum, GO terms, pathways, microRNA target, protein–protein interaction and
gene–disease network. Meanwhile, combined with concise
search methods, intuitive graphical displays, convenient
browsing functions and constantly updatable features, the
‘SkeletonGenetics’ database could serve as a reclassified
reference tool and valuable resource for unveiling the genetic and pathway basis of GSD.
With the development of the high-throughput sequencing, massive genetic skeletal disorder related genes and mutations have been identified in the past decade, but there is
still about 30–40% of GSD with undiscovered disease
genes (4, 6) because of the restriction of patients and complexity of the gene interaction network. In this study, functional analysis of the known GSD genes in publications
mostly involved in specific GO items, such as skeletal system development, appendage development, limb development, appendage morphogenesis and limb morphogenesis
or pathways, such as classical FGFs, TGF-beta, Hedgehog,
WNT, Notch signaling pathways. Meanwhile, many of the
new identified genes interact with known GSD genes (32–
35) or key GSD genes could induce the disease state. In
SkeletonGenetics, if researchers have found a specific GSD
gene, they may link to the ‘Analysis’ page to see whether
the new gene is involved in any skeletal-related GO terms,
pathways or PPIs. This database would be important and
useful for revealing novel GSD-related genes and pathways. Therefore, researchers could focus on the other unknown genes, which were involved in the same skeletal
development and homeostasis functions module combined
with biochemical, molecular information or the group of
disorders with similar phenotypic features.
The increasing availability of massive parallel sequencing and other new sequencing technologies will likely result
in a rapid and cost-effective identification of many GSDcausing genes and mutations, or novel phenotypes associated with mutations in genes already linked to other
