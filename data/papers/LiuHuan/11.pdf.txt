This note studies the Monge­Amp` ere Keller­Segel equation in a periodic domain Td (d  2), a fully nonlinear modification of the Keller­Segel equation where the Monge­Amp` ere equation det(I + 2 v ) = u + 1 substitutes for the usual Poisson equation v = u. The existence of global weak solutions  is obtained for this modified  equation. Moreover, we prove the regularity in L 0, T ; L  W 1,1+ (Td ) for some  > 0. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

1. Introduction Keller­Segel (KS) model was firstly presented in 1970 to describe the chemotaxis of cellular slime molds [1]. The original model was considered in 2-dimension,  2  t u = u +  · (uv ), x  R , t > 0, (1) v = u(t, x),  u(0, x) = u (x). 0 In the context of biological aggregation, u(t, x) represents the bacteria density, and v (t, x) represents the chemical substance concentration. In this note, we study the Monge­Amp` ere Keller­Segel (MAKS) model in a periodic domain Td = Rd /Zd (d  2):  d  t u = u +  · (uv ), x  T , t > 0, (2) det(I + 2 v ) = u + 1,  u(0, x) = u (x). 0

where I is the identity matrix. In the absence of u term in (2), this model was introduced by Brenier [2, (5.34), (5.36)] as a fully nonlinear version of popular models in chemotaxis theory, such as the celebrated Keller­Segel model or similar models in astrophysics. We will prove the global existence of weak solutions to MAKS model (2) in a weak sense, which is made precise in Section 2. Monge­Amp` ere Keller­Segel system (2) is an approximation of the original KS system (1) in the following re-scaling. Let us recast the equation (2) by introducing the new unknowns:     1 t x t x u (t, x) = u , ; v  (t, x) = v , .      Then we have  u(t, x) = u (t, x);  v (t, x) = v  (t, x).

Moreover, these new unknowns should be governed by the following MAKS system  t u = u +  · (u v  ), det(I +  2 v  ) = 1 + u . We formally linearize the determinant det(I +  2 v  ) around the identity matrix and obtain 1 + u = det(I +  2 v  ) = 1 +  v  + O( 2 ).

Then the Monge­Amp` ere equation turns into the Poisson equation v  = u + O( ), from which, when we set O( ) = 0, we recognize the MAKS system (3) as the original KS system showed in (1). The density u in the original KS system (1) is driven by the gradient of Newtonian potential v = N  u, where N is the fundamental solution of Laplacian equation, and potential v has the superposition principle relation with u. Moreover, it has an important property: if 0  u  L (Td ), then v is log-Lipschitz continuous. However, for MAKS model (2), the Newtonian potential is replaced by a convex potential V [u] discovered by Brenier [3]. The advantage is that v = V [u] - x is globally convex and has uniform L bound if 0  u  L1 (Td ). But the convex potential will lose the superposition principle relation with the density. There are many mathematical models involved substituting the fully nonlinear Monge­Amp` ere equation for the Poisson equation. For example, the semigeotrophic equations in meteorology have a long history. After suitable changes of variables, they can be reformulated as a coupled Monge­Amp` ere/transport problem [4], which appear as a variant of the two-dimensional incompressible Euler equations in vorticity form, where the Poisson equation that relates to the stream function and the vorticity field is replaced by the Monge­Amp` ere equation [4­7]. Moreover, in [8], Brenier and Loeper studied the Vlasov­Monge­Amp` ere system, a fully non-linear version of the Vlasov­Poisson system. Similarly, Brenier [9], by substituting the Monge­Amp` ere equation for the linear Poisson equation to model gravitation, he introduced a modified Zeldovich approximate model related to the early universe reconstruction problem. 2. The polar decomposition theorem The polar factorization of maps has been discovered by Brenier [3]. It was later extended to the general case of Riemannian manifolds by McCann in [10]. - - - Let us consider a mapping X : Rd  Rd such that for all  p  Zd , X (· +  p) = X + p . We use the d push-forward of Lebesgue measure of R by X , and it is denoted by u = X dx. Then u is a probability measure on Td and we have the following theorem: Theorem 1 (Theorem 1.2 [6]). Let X : Rd  Rd be described as above with u = X dx.

 [u] such that V  [u] - x2 /2 is Zd -periodic (and 1. Up to a constant, there exists a unique convex function V d  thus V [u] - x is Z -periodic), and   C 0 (Td ),   [u](x))dx = (V

Link with the Monge­Amp` ere equation. We can interpret (5) as a weak version of the Monge­ Amp` ere equation  ) det 2 V  = 1, u(V and (6) can be seen as a weak version of another Monge­Amp` ere equation det 2 V = u. (8) (7)

Moreover, we will also use the following result originally from [3]. The first one establishes the continuity of the polar decomposition. Theorem 2 (Theorem 2.6 [6]). Let un be a sequence of Lebesgue integrable positive measures on Td , such that   =V  [un ], Vn = V [un ] be as defined in Theorem 1. If for any   C 0 (Td ) for all n, Td dun  C and let V  n n can be chosen in such a way that V n converges such that dun converges to du, then the sequence V d 1, 1 d d  to V [u] uniformly on T and strongly in W (T ), and Vn converges to V [u] uniformly on T and strongly in W 1,1 (Td ). Theorem 1 allows us to recast MAKS equation (2) as t u = u +  · (u(V [u + 1] - x)), u(0, x) = u0 (x). where V [u + 1] is as defined in Theorem 1. For simplicity, we denote V [u + 1] as V [u]. Remark 1. If u is continuous and satisfies 0  u  C1 , it has been proved in [11] that V [u](x) is log-Lipschitz continuous. The log-Lipschitz continuity usually ensures the uniqueness and stability in the Wasserstein distance. Moreover, according to [8, Theorem 4.4], if u  C  (Td ),   (0, 1), then V [u] is a classical solution of det 2 V [u] = u + 1. (10) x  Td , t > 0, (9a) (9b)

3. Existence of global weak solutions To begin this section, we give the following definition of the weak solution to the MAKS equation (9).

Definition 1. Let initial data 0  u0  L1 (Td ). Then (u, V ) is a global weak solution to (9) if it satisfies for any T > 0:       1. u  L 0, T ; L1 (Td )  L2 0, T ; H 1 (Td ) and t u  L2 0, T ; H -1 (Td ) .    2.    Cc [0, T ) × Td ,  T  T  ut dxdt = (u + u(V - x) · )dxdt -
0 Td 0 Td Td

u0 (0, x)dx,

where V is defined as in Theorem 1. The main result of this note is as follows: Theorem 3. Let initial data 0  u0  L2 (Td ). Then the MAKS system (2) admits a global non-negative weak   solution (u, V ) in t  [0, T ] for any T > 0. And the conservation of mass holds: Td u(t, x)dx = Td u0 (x)dx. Proof. We build a sequence of approximate solutions (u , V )>0 by regularization and let  goes to zero. To do the limiting process, the non-linear term will be treated with the help of Theorem 2. Step 1: Construction of a sequence of approximate solutions. We consider a mollifier  (x)    (Rd ) such that  (x)  0, Td  (x)dx = 1 and  (x) = -d  (x/). And we can define the mollification Cc  as   u0 := Td  (x - y )u0 (y )dy . Then we study solutions to the following approximate problem t u = u +  · (u (V (x) - x)) , u,0 (x) =   u0 (x), V (x) =   V [u ]. x  Td , t > 0, (11a) (11b) (11c)

Since V given by (11c) is bounded in H k (Td ) for any k and  > 0, the estimate for Eq. (11a) for any fixed  > 0 is basically same as that for the heat equation. Hence, the solvability of the regularized problem (11) can be obtained by using the technique in Majda and Bertozzi [12, Section 3.2.2], where it proved the global existence of the solution to a regularization of the Euler and Navier­Stokes equation by using the Picard theorem and continuation property of ODEs on a Banach space. We omit the detail here. Step 2: Weak convergence of u and u . Multiplying Eq. (11a) by 2u and integrating over Td , we obtain  d 2 2 2 u 2 + 2 u 2 = - u (V - x) · u dx  u 2 + C u 2 (12) 2. dt d T  where we have used V - x  d/2. Hence for any T > 0, the following estimates hold u L (0,T ;L2 (Td ))  CT , u L2 (0,T ;L2 (Td ))  CT . (13)

According to the above estimates, there is a subsequence (still denote u ), such that as   0, the following weak convergence results hold      u -  u in L 0, T ; L2 (Td ) , u  u in L2 0, T ; L2 (Td ) . (14) Step 3: Strong convergence of V (t, ·) a.e. t. We claim that for any p  [1, ), V (t, ·)  V (t, ·) in Lp (Td ), a.e. t  [0, T ]. (15)

30

H. Huang, J.-G. Liu / Applied Mathematics Letters 61 (2016) 26­34

Indeed, such strong convergence of V follows from Theorem 2 provided that we have for a.e. t  [0, T ],   (x)u (t, x)dx  (x)u(t, x)dx, (16)
Td Td

for any   C 0 (Td ). To verify (16), we need to prove that there is a subsequence (still denote u ) u  u in L2 (Td ) a.e. t  [0, T ], as   0. Indeed, it is easy to check that t u L2 (0,T ;H -1 (Td ))  CT , which leads to   u  u in L2 0, T ; L2 (Td ) , as   0, (17)

(18)

by using Aubin­Lions lemma as H 1 (Td )  L2 (Td )  H -1 (Td ). Then (17) follows from (18), which completes the proof of (15). Step 4: Existence of a global weak solution. Next, we will show that (u, V [u]) is a weak solution to    (9). The weak formulation for u is that for any test function   Cc [0, T ) × Td ,  T  T  u t dxdt = (u  + u (V - x) · )dxdt - u,0 (0, x)dx. (19)

Recall that (14), (15), (18) and V - x  d/2. Then by using the dominant convergence theorem, one concludes that by passing limit   0 in (19)  T  T  ut dxdt = (u + u(V - x) · )dxdt - u0 (0, x)dx. (20)

We finished the proof of the existence of global weak solutions. Step 5: Positivity preserving. By using Lemma 7.6 in [13], if we define the negative part of the function u as u- := min{u, 0}, then one can easily prove that  d 2 2 u- 2 + 2  u  = - u- (V - x) · u- dx  u- 2 + C u- 2 (21) - 2 2 2. dt d T Applying Gronwall's inequality to d 2 u- 2 2  C u- 2 ; dt one has u- 2 2  0, which leads to u(t, x)  0. Step 6: Conservation of mass. Integrating (9a) over Td and using the fact that u, V - x are periodic, one has    d udx = udx +  · (u(V - x))dx = 0. (23) dt Td Td Td Thus, we conclude that  u(t, x)dx =

4. Regularity in L (0, T ; L  W 1,1+ (Td )) Theorem 4. Let initial data 0  u0  L (Td ) and u0  L1+ (Td ) for some  > 0. Suppose (u, V ) be a weak solution to MAKS equation (9), then for any T > 0 and t  [0, T ],   u(t, x)  L 0, T ; L  W 1,1+ (Td ) . (25)

Proof. First we will prove that u(·, t)  C (T, d, A0 ), (26)

with A0 = max{1, u0 L1 (Td ) , u0 L (Td ) }. Multiplying (9a) with pup-1 , p  2 and integrating over Td , we have    p 2 p p 4(p - 1)  d  p p 2 (V - x)u dx = -2(p - 1) (V - x)u 2 u 2 dx up + u  = -(p - 1) dt p 2 Td Td  p    p p 2 2(p - 1)   2   (27)  C u  u 2   u 2  + C up p. p 2 2 2 Then the L bound can be obtained directly by the standard Moser iteration after getting (27). For example, one can check the paper by Alikakos [14], formula (3.20) and the computation afterwards. For completeness, we put these detail computation in Appendix. From Theorem 3, we know that u is positivity preserving and the conservation of mass hold: u  0; u(t, x)1 = u0 1 , for t  [0, T ]. (28)

By the construction of V in Theorem 1, one concludes that  2  1  det( V )  u + 1, V convex,  V - x2 /2 periodic. Recall the result in [15, P.16], for some  > 0 we have 2 V 1+  C (T, d, u ).

Applying a generalized Gronwall's inequality with weak singularities [16, Lemma 7.1.1], we have u1+  C (T, d, u0 1+ , u0  ) , which concludes the proof.

Define pk := 2k + 2 with k  0. For k = 0, p0 = 3, from (A.1) we have

(A.2)

For k  1, take pk upk -1 as a test function in (9a), one has  2 pk 4(pk - 1)  d   k 2  - (p - 1) up (V - x)up = -  u  k pk k dx dt pk 2 Td  2   p   pk pk     k   -2Cpk u 2  + pk u 2  u 2  .

(A.8)

It is easy to know that C1 (pk ) and C2 (pk ) is uniformly bounded for any k  1. So, we let C (d) > 1 be a common upper bound of C1 (pk ) and C2 (pk ), we obtain the following inequality d q2 pk pk k up pk  -upk + C (d)pk upk-1 . dt Solving the inequality (A.9), we get
